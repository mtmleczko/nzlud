PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Billings, Montana, of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1967 Code, as supplemented through March 15, 1982, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1967 Code, as supplemented, and any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code in included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Articles within each chapter are numbered in sets of 100 sections. The first article of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-100, the second Article is 2-200, etc. The first section of Article 2-100 is 2-101. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and article and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of one section that would logically come between Sections 2-101 and 2-102 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 2-101.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be place at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will dependent largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

DIVISION 3. - RULES OF PROCEDURE 

Sec. 2-221. - Rules of procedure for regular and special meetings. 
    The regular and special meetings of the city council shall in all cases be governed by the following rules, unless the same are suspended, pro tempore by a majority vote of the council: 
(1)  Decorum. 
a.  The presiding officer shall preserve order and decorum and shall decide all questions of order, subject to appeal to the council. 
b.  Every member, previous to speaking, shall address the presiding officer, but shall not proceed until recognized and named by the presiding officer. The provisions of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised concerning assigning the floor are superseded by this rule of procedure. 
c.  When two (2) or more members address the presiding officer, the first to have precedence shall be decided by the presiding officer. The provisions of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised concerning assigning the floor are superseded by this rule of procedure. 
d.  While a question is being placed on the floor, no member shall speak or walk across the chambers or council room or leave the same. 
e.  When any member is addressing the council, no other member shall engage in private conversation or do any other act to divert attention or interrupt the speaker. 
f.  At council meetings all questions relating to the priority of business shall be decided without debate. 
g.  To preserve council chamber decorum and minimize council and audience distractions, television cameras are to be confined to designated areas. Interviews in the chamber are permissible after meetings. No interview or live narration will be allowed in the chamber prior to or during the proceedings of a meeting. 
(2)  Meeting protocol. 
a.  A member shall not speak more than twice on the same subject without leave of a majority of the council, nor more than once until every member desiring to speak on the pending question has had an opportunity to do so. 
b.  No motion shall be debated or put to a vote unless the same shall be seconded. The motion and second shall then be stated by the mayor. 
c.  All motions shall be stated in clear, concise and definite terms, beginning with the language: "I move that...". "I so move" or any other abbreviated language does not constitute correct form for a motion and is out of order. 
d.  After a motion has been stated by the presiding officer it shall be deemed in possession of the council, but may be withdrawn at any time before amendment or decision, by the mover with consent of the second. 
e.  If a question under consideration contains more than one distinct proposition any member may demand a division. 
f.  When a question is under debate, no motion shall be entertained, except: First, to adjourn; second, to lay on the table; third, for the previous question; fourth, to postpone to a day certain; fifth, to refer to a committee; sixth, to amend; and seventh, to postpone indefinitely. These motions shall have precedence in the order stated. 
g.  Amendment of a question may take the form of a motion to substitute. Adoption of a motion to substitute shall be deemed approval of the substitute motion itself and further debate and amendment of the adopted substitute motion are not in order. The provisions of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised concerning substitute motions are superseded by this rule of procedure. 
h.  A motion to adjourn shall always be in order, except when a member is addressing the chair, or a vote is being taken. Motions to adjourn and lay on the table shall not be debatable. 
i.  No motion on a subject different from that under consideration shall be permitted. 
j.  After a vote is announced, no councilmember shall change his vote without following the procedure for reconsideration. 
k.  No motion for reconsideration shall be in order unless made at the same meeting or the meeting following that on which the decision was made, nor shall such motion be made except by a member who voted with the majority upon the adoption. If the motion for reconsideration is approved by a majority vote of the city council, then the decision on which the vote is to be reconsidered is placed back on the agenda at a location specified by the mayor for further consideration and another vote. 
l.  In case a voice vote is indeterminate, a roll call vote shall be taken. 
m.  In case of a tie vote on any proposal, the proposal shall be considered lost/failed. 
n.  The city attorney shall rule on all questions of parliamentary procedure and the attorney's decision shall be final. 
o.  Every member of the council present shall vote upon every question submitted to the council, unless excused or unless the member has a financial or personal interest as defined and provided below: 
Financial or personal interest. No official, either on his or her own behalf or on behalf of any other person, shall have any financial or personal interest in any business or transaction with any public body unless the official shall first make full public disclosure of the nature and extent of such interest. 
If a member has a financial or personal interest in a matter before the mayor and council that requires a vote or other decision or direction to city staff, the member shall, immediately after the motion has been made and seconded, or as soon thereafter as the member may be recognized by the presiding officer, publicly disclose the nature and extent of such interest and disqualify himself or herself from participation in the deliberation and voting on the question. 
For purposes of evaluating whether or not a conflict of interest requires the mayor or a council member to disqualify themselves from the deliberation and vote on any question, the following definitions shall apply: 
Disclosure and disqualification. Whenever the performance of his or her official duties shall require any official to deliberate and vote on any matter involving the official's financial or personal interest, the official shall publicly disclose the nature and extent of such interest and disqualify himself or herself from participating in the discussion, deliberation as well as in the voting on such matter. 
Financial interest means any interest which shall yield, directly or indirectly, a monetary or other material benefit (other than the duly authorized salary or compensation for his or her services to the city) to the official or to any person employing or retaining the services of the official. 
Official means any person elected to a city office, employed by the city, or appointed to any public office or public body of the city whether paid or unpaid and whether part-time or full-time. 
Personal interest means any interest arising from family or marriage relationships or from close personal, business or political association whether or not any financial interest is involved. 
Private interest. Private interest is a direct or indirect interest of a natural person, partnership, corporation or any other entity including a political entity other than the city or an organization in which the city is affiliated. This definition also includes an interest held by an individual that is: ownership interest in a business; a creditor interest in an insolvent business; membership in a business as a director or officer; ownership in real property; a loan or other debtor interest; or an employment relationship or prospective employment for which negotiations have begun. 
Public body means any agency, board, body, commission, committee, department or office of the city. 
(3)  Documentation of proceedings. 
a.  In all cases the name of the member proposing a motion and seconding the motion shall be entered in the council minutes. 
b.  Upon the final passage of any ordinance or resolution, the ayes and noes shall be entered in the council minutes unless the same is unanimously adopted. Any member may demand the roll call of ayes and noes upon any question pending. Except as provided in this subsection, a vote on all matters before the city council shall be by voice vote. 
c.  All reports, petitions, ordinances or resolutions shall be reduced to writing before being submitted to the vote of the council. 
d.  Application of Robert's Rules of Order. In all parliamentary practice not herein prescribed, Robert's "Rules of Order Newly Revised" shall govern so far as applicable. 
(4)  Public hearings. Public hearings may be required by law or by council policy. Public hearings are held for the purpose of noticing legislative facts and receiving expressions of public opinion on a question, including views of interested parties. At the commencement of any public hearing, the presiding officer may set time limits for the presentation of views of proponents and opponents of the measure. These time limits shall be adhered to strictly. At the conclusion of his testimony at a public hearing, any individual may be questioned by any member of the council. The time involved in such question and reply shall not count against the time allowed for the presentation of views.

4.  After a motion has been stated by the presiding officer it shall be deemed in possession of the group, but may be withdrawn at any time before amendment or decision, by the mover with consent of the second. 
5.  If a question under consideration contains more than one (1) distinct proposition any member may demand a division.

These motions shall have precedence in the order stated. 
7.  Amendment of a question may take the form of a motion to substitute.

The provisions of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised concerning substitute motions are superseded by this rule of procedure. 
8.  A motion to adjourn shall always be in order, except when a member is addressing the chair, or a vote is being taken. Motions to adjourn and lay on the table shall not be debatable.

If a member has a financial or personal interest, the member shall, immediately after the motion has been made and seconded, or as soon thereafter as the member may be recognized by the presiding officer, publicly disclose the nature and extent of such interest and disqualify himself or herself from participation in the deliberation and voting on the question.

Sec. 5-401. - Finding and purpose. 
    Obstructions, tall trees, structures, and certain types of developments situated in the vicinity of airports endanger the lives and property of users of the airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity; reduce the area available for landing, taking off, and maneuvering aircraft; and increase the likelihood of legal action against the city for noise nuisance, thus destroying the utility of the airports and the public investment in them. It is therefore the intent of this article to apply special height and land development standards in airport approach and noise exposure areas for the purposes of: 
(1)  Promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of the general public. 
(2)  Increasing safety in the use of airports. 
(3)  Protecting persons and property within the district and elsewhere. 
(4)  Encouraging land uses that will complement and be compatible with the airport and the physical and visual aspects of the environment. 
(Ord. No. 86-4687, § 1, 4-28-86) 
Sec. 5-402. - Applicability. 
(a)  The airport influence area and noise zone is superimposed over existing zoning districts (as established by the city or county zoning ordinances) in airport approach areas according to Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 77, "Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace," by the Federal Aviation Administration, and as applied to Billings Logan International Airport. The regulations and restrictions set forth herein shall be applied to those properties determined to be within the overlay district, in addition to the underlying zoning regulations and restrictions of said properties. If there is a conflict between the provisions of the overlay zone created by this article and the provisions of the underlying zone created by the pertinent zoning ordinance, the more restrictive provision shall apply. 
(b)  The airport influence area and noise zone includes two (2) overlays that are not necessarily coterminous: One for height regulations and one for land use regulations. For purposes of this article, references to the airport influence area and noise zone mean the outer boundary of the two (2) overlays when combined. For some parcels, only special height regulations shall apply; for some parcels, only special land use regulations shall apply; and for some parcels, both height and land use regulations shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 86-4687, § 1, 4-28-86) 
Sec. 5-403. - District established for Billings Logan International Airport. 
    An airport influence area and noise zone for Billings Logan International Airport is hereby established and shown on Exhibits C-1 and C-2 included and made part of this article. 
(Ord. No. 86-4687, § 1, 4-28-86) 
Editor's note- Exhibit C-1 relative to the airport influence area height and hazard limitation zone and Exhibit C-2 pertaining to aircraft noise overlay zones are not set out herein but are no file and available for inspection in the offices of the city. 
Sec. 5-404. - Definitions. 
    In the airport influence area and noise zones, unless the context requires otherwise, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings. 
    Acoustical treatment: The appropriate design and construction of new structures, or the alteration of existing structures, to result in a noise reduction (exterior-to-interior) sufficient to ensure that the interior day-night sound level (Ldn) in all habitable rooms does not exceed Ldn 45 during aircraft operations. 
    Aircraft hazard: Any structure or object of natural growth located on or in the vicinity of Billings Logan International Airport, or any use of land near the airport, which obstructs the airspace required for the flight of aircraft in landing or takeoff at the airport or otherwise causes a danger or potential danger to such landing or takeoff of aircraft. 
    Aircraft noise overlay zone: An overlay on the basic zoning districts, applied within the airport influence area, depicting the latest potential aircraft noise contours for Billings Logan International Airport. Within the zone, specific land use compatibility regulations apply, depending on the level of potential aircraft noise exposure. 
    Airport: Billings Logan International Airport. 
    Airport influence area: A rectangular area extending ten thousand (10,000) feet out in each direction from the thresholds of the primary instrument approach runway (Runway 9L-27R at Billings Logan International Airport) and one mile on each side of the extended centerline of that runway, as established by MCA Title 67, Chapter 4. For Billings Logan International Airport, the rectangle measures thirty thousand five hundred twenty-eight (30,528) feet long by ten thousand five hundred sixty (10,560) feet wide. 
    Board of airport hazard adjustment: As established by Section 5-413 Billings, Montana City Code. 
    Day-night sound level (Ldn): A method for describing the estimated cumulative aircraft noise exposure that affects communities in airport environs. The Ldn value represents decibels of noise as measured by an A-weighted sound-level meter. In the Ldn procedures, noise exposures are accumulated for a typical twenty-four-hour period. Daytime and nighttime noise exposures are considered separately. A weighting factor equivalent to a penalty of ten (10) decibels is applied to aircraft operations or other noise sources between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. to account for the increased sensitivity of people to nighttime noise. The Ldn values can be expressed graphically on maps using either contours or grid cells. 
    Decibel (dB): A unit for measuring the volume of a sound, equal to the logarithm of the ratio of the intensity of the sound to the intensity of an arbitrarily chosen standard sound. 
    Director of aviation: The person designated by the City of Billings to exercise functions with respect to determining conformance with airport height zone limitations and making recommendations regarding airport noise zone land use restrictions. 
    Hazard to air navigation: An obstruction determined to have a substantial adverse affect on the safe and efficient utilization of the navigable airspace. 
    Height: In the context of this article, maximum height means the maximum permitted height in feet of any structure or tree above the established elevation in feet, mean sea level, of the nearest end of an existing or proposed runway or, if otherwise stated, the airport elevation. 
    Height and hazard limitation zones: Regulations within the airport influence area that specify the maximum height of structures or objects of natural growth in conformance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations, as well as prohibitions against developing land uses that could result in a hazard to air navigation. The regulations in the height and hazard limitations zones are superimposed over existing zoning districts and only apply if they are more restrictive than the underlying zoning regulations. 
    Noise: Any sound that is undesirable because it interferes with speech and hearing, or is intense enough to damage hearing, or is otherwise annoying. 
    Noise contours: Lines drawn on a map that connect points of equal Ldn values. 
    Noise grid: Squares or "cells" of equal size superimposed over a base map of an airport or other noise source and its environs. Numbers printed in each grid cell represent the Ldn value of noise at the center of the square for a particular year being studied. Several numbers representing several years can also be displayed. Grid cells may be of any size, depending on the study area. For Billings Logan International Airport, the cell is one thousand (1,000) feet per side (about twenty-three (23) acres) and is used for purposes of noise analysis and land use planning. 
    Nonconforming use: Any pre-existing structure, tree, natural growth, or use of land which is inconsistent with the provisions of this article or an amendment thereto. 
    Person: Means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, company, association, joint stock association, or body politic, and includes a trustee, receiver, assignee, administrator, executor, guardian, or other representative. 
    Runway: Paved surface of an airport landing strip used for aircraft takeoffs and landings. 
    Structure: Any object constructed or installed by man, including, but without limitation, buildings, towers, smokestacks, earth formations, and overhead transmission lines. 
    Structure, height of: The vertical distance measured from the adjoining curb level to the highest point of the structure, including chimneys and ventilators; provided that, where structures are set back from the street line or are located within an open area and not adjacent to streets, the height shall be measured from the average elevation of the finished grade at the front of the structure. 
    Tree: Any object of natural growth. 
    Tree, height of: The vertical distance measured from the adjoining curb level to the highest point of the tree; provided that, where trees are set back from the street line or are located within an open area and not adjacent to streets, the height shall be measured from the average elevation of the grade at the base of the tree. 
    Uniform Building Code (UBC): The building code as used by the City of Billings and Yellowstone County. 
    Zoning commission: As established by Section 27-1001, Billings, Montana City Code. 
    Zoning coordinator: The person designated by the city-county planning board to exercise functions with respect to this article and as designated in Section 27-1102, Billings, Montana City Code.

Sec. 5-407. - Aircraft hazard land use restrictions. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of the city or county zoning ordinances, no use, structure, or equipment may be located and no activity may be performed within the airport influence area and noise zones which would: 
(1)  Communications. Create unreasonable interference with either existing or planned future (1) radio communication for aircraft using the airport and (2) electronic navigational aids or devices such as instrument landing systems. Generators, motors, and artificial lighting devices which create excessive static are examples of equipment that can cause interference. 
(2)  Visibility. Create a hazard to flying by materially reducing visibility within the airport influence area, such as incinerators, rock crushers, smelters, chemical manufacturing, and similar uses. 
(3)  Illumination. Make it difficult for fliers to distinguish between airport or other navigational lights or markers and other lights, or cause glare to fliers using the airport, such as any arrangement and use of lights which resemble a layout or color of a landing area, or search lights or flash-type advertising signs. 
(4)  Dangerous activities. Results in any business, structure, tree, occupation, or use which is dangerous or hazardous to the safety of aircraft or persons using the airport, or to property or persons in the airport influence area. Towers, poles, smokestacks, advertising balloons, above-ground bulk storage of petroleum products, and fireworks manufacturing are examples of potentially dangerous uses, structures, and activities.

Sec. 5-408. - Height limitations generally. 
    No structure shall be erected or altered, and no tree shall be allowed to grow, or be maintained, which shall exceed the height limits set forth for the airport influence area over and above the elevations stated in feet above mean sea level (MSL), as indicated in Exhibit C-1. Height limits set by zones over which airport approach zones are superimposed, if lesser, shall prevail. If a proposed structure or tree shall lie on or across the boundary of two (2) or more zones, the more restrictive height limit shall apply. No variances to the height limitations set forth in this section shall be granted.

Editor's note- Exhibit C-1 referred to above is not set out in this article but is on file and available for inspection in the offices of the city. 
Sec. 5-409. - Aircraft noise compatibility regulations. 
    /It is generally recognized that residential and some other uses may be incompatible in areas that are exposed to aircraft noise levels of Ldn 65 or higher unless the structures are insulated with acoustical material for sound attenuation to lower the interior noise levels. The objective is to achieve an interior noise level of Ldn 45 in habitable spaces. Therefore, except as otherwise provided in the city or county zoning ordinances, proposed new land uses in an aircraft noise overlay zone shall conform with the regulations set forth in this section. 
(1)  Aircraft noise overlay zone. The areas exposed to aircraft noise from aircraft operations at Billings Logan International airport are depicted in Exhibit C-2 and attached hereto. Exhibit C-2 shall be modified from time to time as conditions change. 
(2)  Land use compatibility standards. Table A, "Land Use Compatibility Standards in Aircraft Noise Exposure Areas", contained herein, provides a list of land uses and the compatibility of land uses within specific noise exposure areas. Table A shall be used only to determine whether a specific land use shall ordinarily be compatible or incompatible with the noise levels expected to be experienced within the zone where the existing or proposed use is or shall be located. Permission or prohibition of specific uses is based exclusively on the noise compatibility criterion. The underlying zone may otherwise expressly prohibit specific uses in order to comply with the general purpose and intent of the city or county zoning ordinances. Therefore, the permitted and conditionally permitted uses of the underlying zones and their greater degree of specificity shall govern, except where a permitted land use (1) shall result in an aircraft hazard as specifically prohibited in section 5-407, or (2) is expressly prohibited in the aircraft noise overlay zone. All other regulations of the city or county zoning ordinances shall apply. 
The compatibility standards set forth in Table A have been derived from guidelines contained in the document Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 150, "Airport Noise Compatibility Planning", Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter I, Subchapter I, Part 150, Table 1, December 18, 1984, by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
(3)  Uses by right or by special airport influence area permit. The general uses listed in Table A shall be permitted either by right or by an airport influence area permit, as applicable. Existing nonconforming uses may remain on the site without any required alterations or treatment until such time as the use or structure becomes subject to the limitations set forth in section 5-410. 
(4)  Aircraft noise exposure update. Aircraft noise levels may vary over time because of changes in aircraft operations, on-airport land use, aircraft engine design or retrofit, and other reasons; therefore, the extent of noise exposure may also change. To ensure that the noise zones applied in the aircraft noise overlay zone accurately reflect the current or predicted aircraft noise exposure pattern, the director of aviation shall, from time to time, as necessary, review the noise level boundaries and submit a map indicating any suggested changes in the noise level boundaries to the city council for approval. If approved, the revised map shall be filed with the Billings City Clerk, Yellowstone County Clerk and Recorder and Yellowstone County Planning Department.

NLR is used to denote the total amount of noise transmission loss in decibels required to reduce an exterior noise level in habitable interior spaces to Ldn 45. In most places, typical building construction automatically provides an NLR of 20 decibels. Therefore, if a structure is located in an area exposed to aircraft noise of Ldn 65, the interior level of noise would be about Ldn 45. If the structure is located in an area exposed to aircraft noise of Ldn 70, the interior level of noise would be about Ldn 50, so an additional NLR of 5 decibels would be required if not afforded by the normal construction. This NLR can be achieved through the use of noise attenuating materials in the construction of the structure. Incompatible = Generally, the land use, whether in a structure or an outdoor activity, is considered to be incompatible with the outdoor noise exposure, even if special attenuating materials were to be used in the construction of the building. a. In climates where existing structures have thin, single-wall construction with minimal insulation, the Ldn 60 to 65 area may not be compatible without additional noise level reduction incorporated into the design and construction. However, it should be noted that in many urban areas, the ambient noise level may be above Ldn 65, so structures in the Ldn 60 to 65 area must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. b. The land use is generally incompatible and should only be permitted in areas of infill in existing neighborhoods or where the community determines that the use must be allowed. c. NLR required in offices or other areas with noise-sensitive activities. Source: Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., as derived from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 150, "Airport Noise Compatibility Planning," Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter 1, Subchapter 1, Part 150, Table 1, January 18, 1985.

Editor's note- Exhibit C-2 referred to in § 5-409(1) above is not set out herein but is on file and available for inspection in the offices of the city. 
Sec. 5-410. - Nonconformity. 
    Notwithstanding other provisions in the city or county zoning ordinances with respect to the nonconforming use of land and buildings, this section shall apply in the airport influence area and noise zones, but shall not replace other provisions when such other provisions are more restrictive. 
(1)  Application of provisions. The height, noise, and land use development regulations prescribed herein shall not be retroactive and shall not (1) be construed to require the removal, lowering, acoustical insulation, or other change or alteration of any structure, tree, or use of land not conforming to the height limit regulations or the land use development regulations as of the effective date of this section; or (2) be applied to any land that has been platted for residential subdivisions prior to the effective date of this section; or (3) otherwise interfere with the continuance of any use on the land or within a structure of nonconforming height or use; or (4) require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this section and is diligently prosecuted and completed within two (2) years; except subject to the following limitations. Any structure or use not conforming to the height limit regulations, or any use on the land or within a structure not conforming to the land use development regulations of this section shall not be: 
a.  Reestablished after discontinuance for one (1) year. 
b.  Extended, enlarged, altered, renovated, or otherwise improved if the improvement exceeds fifty (50) percent of the fair market value of the structure immediately prior to the request for permits for such improvements. 
c.  Changed to any other use except in conformity with this article. 
d.  Rebuilt or repaired after damage exceeding fifty (50) percent of the fair market value immediately prior to damage. 
(2)  Limitation on uses identified as hazards: No permit or approval shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to be made or allowed to exceed height limitations, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of this article or any amendments thereto, or than it is prior to or when the application for permit is made. 
(3)  Repairs. No approval shall be required to make repairs or to replace parts of existing structures, provided that the repairs or parts replacement does not result in an enlargement or increase in the height of the existing structure, and involve less than fifty (50) percent of the fair market value of the structure. 
(4)  Right to install hazard markers. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this article, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree to whom an airport influence area permit or variance has been granted is hereby required to permit the City of Billings, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon navigation markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary under the circumstances by the Federal Aviation Administration or the director of aviation to warn pilots of the presence of an airport hazard. 
(5)  Changes in use. Any change in a nonconforming use shall be subject to the provisions of this section and other applicable provisions of the city zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 86-4687, § 1, 4-28-86) 
Sec. 5-411. - Acoustical treatment. 
(a)  Acoustical treatment shall be required for new noise-sensitive land uses and existing nonconforming uses that become subject to the limitations of section 5-410 and the provisions of Table A, to insure a reduction in exterior noise levels in habitable interior spaces to a level not to exceed Ldn 45. 
(b)  Acoustical treatment shall be required for new noise-sensitive land uses and existing nonconforming uses that become subject to the limitations of section 5-410 and the provisions of Table A so that a noise level reduction (exterior-to-interior) sufficient to ensure that the interior day-night sound level (Ldn) during aircraft operations in all habitable rooms does not exceed Ldn 45. 
(c)  Evidence of compliance with the required acoustical performance of the buildings shall consist of an acoustical analysis report, prepared under the supervision of a person experienced in the field of acoustical engineering, submitted with the application for building permit. 
(Ord. No. 86-4687, § 1, 4-28-86) 
Sec. 5-412. - Airport influence area permit application. 
    Within the aircraft noise overlay zone, height and hazard limitation zones, and the airport influence area, no new structures shall be erected, no uses of land or structures shall be changed, substantially altered, repaired or replaced without first requiring an airport influence area permit therefor. No building permit shall be issued by the city until an airport influence area permit under this article is first obtained. Airport influence area permits shall be applied for in the following manner: 
(1)  An application with appropriate fee shall be filed by the property owner, contract purchaser, or authorized agent. The application shall be filed with the zoning coordinator and shall be submitted with the following minimum information: 
a.  A legal and general description of the tract or tracts upon which the airport influence area permit is sought; 
b.  A map showing the dimensions, acreage and sites of the tract or tracts and adjacent land uses; 
c.  The name and addresses of the owner(s) of the tract or tracts and their agents, if any; 
d.  A site plan showing major details of the proposed development including but not limited to the sites of proposed and existing buildings and structures, heights of all proposed structures, off-street parking and loading, service and refuse areas, means of ingress and egress, landscaping, screening, signs, open space areas, and proposed types of construction materials and acoustical treatment; 
e.  A time schedule for development; 
f.  The applicant shall submit an executed perpetual air rights easement in the form prescribed by the city administrator. Said perpetual air rights easement will grant to the City of Billings for the benefit of the public a perpetual air rights right-of-way for the free and unobstructed navigation and passage of all types of aircraft in and through the air space above the real property involved. 
g.  Any other information the applicant believes will support the request including any structural enforcements that may make the use more compatible. 
(2)  The zoning coordinator, upon receiving an application shall do the following: 
a.  Prior to airport influence area permit issuance, offer the airport department a minimum of ten (10) working days in which to prepare a formal written review and consult with other departments of the city and/or county to fully evaluate the impact of the use(s) contemplated under the application upon public facilities and services; 
b.  Study each application with references to its appropriateness and effect on this article, existing and proposed airport and immediate surrounding land uses, and its relationship to the Billings Comprehensive Plan and the FAR Part 150 Noise Compatibility Program; 
c.  If the zoning coordinator finds upon review as outlined hereinabove that the use proposed is compatible with the noise overlay zones set forth in Exhibit C-2, the zoning coordinator shall issue an airport influence area permit. Further, within an airport influence area a person who obtains an airport influence area permit for building a structure which is a nonconforming use under rules adopted pursuant to this article or a person who takes or buys property subject to such an airport influence area permit is on notice that the airport existed before the airport influence area permit was granted and that normal and anticipated normal operations of the airport will result in noise and vibrations being projected over the property. Furthermore, a person using a structure built under an airport influence area permit may not collect damages from the City of Billings for interference with the enjoyment of that structure caused by noise and vibrations from normal and anticipated normal airport operations. 
d.  If the zoning coordinator finds that the proposed use may receive a variance, the zoning coordinator shall advise the applicant and outline the procedure for obtaining a variance provided, however, that no variance may be applied for or granted on height limitations. 
(Ord. No. 86-4687, § 1, 4-28-86) 
Sec. 5-413. - Board of airport hazard adjustment. 
    There is hereby created for the city, a board of airport hazard adjustment as provided by Section 67-4-312 Montana Codes Annotated, consisting of the five (5) members appointed under Section 27-1005, Billings, Montana City Code, to the board of airport hazard adjustment are concurrent with their terms as members of the board of adjustment. 
(1)  Proceedings. The meetings of the board of airport hazard adjustment shall be held at the same time and in the same manner as set forth for the board of adjustment in Section 27-1005(b), Billings, Montana City Code. 
(2)  Powers and duties. The board of airport hazard adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide variance requests from any person desiring to erect a structure or increase the height of an existing structure, permit the growth of a tree, or use his property in violation of this article. Variances shall be granted as follows: 
a.  No variance shall be granted which would allow the height of a structure or tree to exceed the limits set forth in this article. 
b.  Except as provided in subsection 5-413(1) above, a variance shall be granted where a literal application or enforcement of the article would result in substantial practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and where the variance would not be contrary to the public interest. 
c.  A variance shall be granted for a nonconforming use where there is no immediate hazard to safe flying operations or persons and property in the vicinity of the airport and where the noise or vibrations from normal and anticipated normal operations of the airport would not be likely to cause structural damage. 
d.  Within an airport influence area a person who obtains a variance for building a structure which is a nonconforming use under this article or a person who takes or buys property subject to such a variance is on notice that the airport existed before the variance was granted and that normal and anticipated normal operations of the airport will result in noise and vibrations being projected over the property. Furthermore, a person using a structure built under a variance may not collect damages from the City of Billings for interference with the enjoyment of that structure caused by noise and vibrations from normal and anticipated normal airport operations. 
(3)  Appeals. All of the provisions of sections 76-2-321 through 76-2-328, Montana Codes Annotated, relating to appeals and judicial review are applicable to grievances relating to rules, variances or airport influence area permits. 
(Ord. No. 86-4687, § 1, 4-28-86)

(5)  The application must be submitted at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of the public hearing. 
(6)  An application for a variance may not be withdrawn or amended by the applicant after the legal advertising as required by this article shall have first appeared. However, the board of airport hazard adjustment may, by a two-thirds vote of all members, allow the application to be withdrawn without prejudice to time limitations for filing a variance application. 
(7)  If an application for a variance is denied by the board of airport hazard adjustment, another application shall not be filed within a period of one (1) year from the date of denial, except upon the initiation of the board of airport hazard adjustment after a showing of a change of circumstances which would warrant a rehearing. 
(8)  The zoning coordinator, upon receiving an application for a variance, shall do the following: 
a.  Offer the airport department a minimum of ten (10) working days in which to prepare a formal written review and consult with other departments of the city to fully evaluate the impact of the uses contemplated under the variance application upon public facilities and services; 
b.  Study each application with reference to its appropriateness and effect on existing and proposed land uses; and its relationship to the comprehensive plan; 
c.  Place notice of the time, date and place of the public hearing in the legal newspapers and in a newspaper of general circulation fifteen (15) days in advance of the date set for the public hearing; 
d.  Notify the owner of the property, or his or her agent, of the time, date and place of the public hearing five (5) days in advance of that date; 
e.  Notify the property owners, by mail, within three hundred (300) feet of the exterior boundaries of the property subject to the variance of the time, date and place and proposed use. In the R-150 zone, the zoning coordinator may, at his or her discretion, notify property owners within a radius greater than three hundred (300) feet if he or she deems that the contemplated use would have a substantial environmental impact; 
f.  Place a notice of the time, date and place of the public hearing on the property ten (10) days prior to the hearing date; 
g.  Report his or her findings, in writing, to the board of airport hazard adjustment, which report shall be a matter of public record. 
(9)  Board of airport hazard adjustment action. The board of airport hazard adjustment, before it grants a variance shall determine: 
a.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, the lot or something inherent in the land which causes the hardship, and which are not applicable to other lands in the same district; 
b.  That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of the rights commonly enjoyed by other tracts in the same district; 
c.  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this article to other land in the same district; 
d.  That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and with the comprehensive plan; 
e.  In grating any variance, the board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this article. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms upon which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this article. 
f.  The board shall prescribe a time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be begun or completed, or both. Failure to begin or complete such action within the time limit set shall void the variance; 
g.  Under no circumstances shall the board grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this article in the district involved. A variance shall not be a grant of special privilege inconsistent with limitations placed upon other property in the district. 
(Ord. No. 86-4687, § 1, 4-28-86) 
Sec. 5-415. - Nonsignificant projects. 
    The following projects within the airport influence area and noise zones shall be considered nonsignificant and exempt from the provisions of section 5-409 except that the height limitations of section 5-408 and any other applicable provisions of the city or county zoning ordinances shall apply. 
(1)  Signs. 
(2)  Interior repairs and interior alterations which do not exceed fifty (50) percent of the building volume or are less than fifty (50) percent of the fair market value of the structure and do not increase the building volume and/or change the use of the space from its original use shall be exempt from the requirements of this article. All other interior alterations shall be subject to the provisions of this section. 
(3)  Temporary structures and uses incidental to building construction and land development.

Such a redetermination shall not affect the airline's obligation to pay its share of common use rentals related to the equal share of costs that comprise twenty (20) percent of common use rentals. Rentals for joint use space shall be prorated a month the airlines using such space according to the joint use formula, and shall be recalculated every three (3) months. 
(d)  Landing fees. Airline shall pay city monthly landing fees to be determined by multiplying the number of one thousand (1,000) pound units of total landed weight for airline during the month by the then current landing fee rate established pursuant to 5-607(c) hereof. 
(e)  Payment provisions/interest on overdue amounts. 
(1)  Terminal building space rentals shall be due and payable in equal monthly installments in advance on or before the first business day of each month and shall be subject to adjustment as provided in section 5-607. 
(2)  Upon receipt of an airline's monthly activity report submitted to the city as provided in section 5-606(b), the city shall transmit to the airline an invoice for the amount of landing fees incurred by the airline during said month, as computed by the city. The acceptance by the city of any payment made by the airline shall not preclude the city from verifying the accuracy of the airline's report and computations or from recovering any additional payment actually due from the airline. Within twenty-one (21) days from the last day of the preceding month, the airline shall pay its total landing fees for that preceding month to the city.

a.  The total estimated direct and allocated indirect maintenance and operating expenses allocable to the terminal building. 
b.  An amount equal to one-hundred and twenty-five (125) percent of the annual debt service requirement on airport revenue bonds allocable to the terminal building. 
c.  An amount equal to the annual principal and interest due on subordinated debt allocable to the terminal building. 
d.  The estimated annual amortization of the cost of the city assets allocable to the terminal building and financed by the city from sources other than airport revenue bonds or grants-in-aid. Such annual amortization shall be calculated at an interest rate of seven (7) percent for thirty (30) years. 
e.  An amount equal to the deposit to the maintenance and operating reserve account allocable to the terminal building. 
f.  Any other cost or expense allocable to the terminal building. 
g.  Any estimated credit or deficit allocable to the terminal building resulting from an excess or shortfall in revenues or expenses during the current fiscal year or resulting from the variance between estimated and actual revenues and expenses used in calculating terminal building rentals. 
(2)  The estimated terminal building cost for the fiscal year will then be divided by the total amount of rentable space (after DBO) to determine the average terminal building rental rate per square foot. 
(c)  Calculation of the landing fee rate. Beginning in January 1, 1991, the landing fee shall be set at one dollar fourteen cents ($1.14) per one thousand (1,000) pound unit landed weight. Beginning July 1, 1992 or at such time as capitalized interest is insufficient to pay the annual debt service requirement, a landing fee rate per one thousand-pound unit of total maximum certificated gross landing weight shall be calculated annually in the following manner as illustrated in Exhibit E to Ordinance Number 90-4838 [incorporated herein by reference]. Whenever the adjustment calculation involves an estimate, the estimate of the city shall be used and shall be based on past performance and future expectations. 
(1)  Each year the city shall calculate the airport cost for the succeeding fiscal year by totaling the following amounts: 
a.  The total of estimated direct and indirect maintenance and operating expenses of the airport. 
b.  An amount equal to one hundred and twenty-five (125) percent of the annual debt service requirement on airport revenue bonds of the airport. 
c.  An amount equal to the principal and interest on the subordinated debt of the airport. 
d.  The annual amortization of the total amount of any expenditures made by the city for capital improvements before July 1 of the adjustment year, and financed by the city from the capital fund. Such amortization is to be computed at seven (7) percent annual interest for thirty (30) years. 
e.  An amount equal to the deposit to the maintenance and operating reserve account and the deposit, if any, to the renewal and replacement reserve account. 
f.  Any other cost or expense of the airport. 
g.  The capital improvement factor. 
h.  Any credit or deficit resulting from an excess or shortfall in revenues or expenses during the current fiscal year or resulting from the variance between estimated and actual revenues and expenses used in calculating airline rentals, fees, and charges. 
(2)  The airport requirement for the succeeding fiscal year shall be calculated by crediting: (1) nonairline revenues; and (2) airline terminal building rentals; all as set forth in the annual budget, to the airport cost calculated pursuant to section 5-607(c)(1). 
(3)  The landing fee rate for the succeeding fiscal year shall be calculated by dividing the airport requirement calculated pursuant to 5-607(c)(2) by the composite estimate of the total landed weight of the airlines for succeeding fiscal year. 
(d)  Extraordinary adjustments of rentals, fees, and charges. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, if, at any time during the term hereof, airport revenues and fund balances are not sufficient to pay, when due, all items included in the reports prepared by the city pursuant to this section 5-607, or to pay any other expense or cost necessary to, or arising out of, the operation of the airport, including, without limitation, emergency repairs or replacements, the reasonable necessary cost of defending, settling, or satisfying any litigation or threatened litigation that relates to the airport, or any aspect thereof, to compensate for the loss of revenue by reason of any labor dispute, or to compensate for the temporary or permanent loss of air service provided by airlines, the city may, upon notice to the airlines, increase the rentals, fees, and charges to such amount as is sufficient to assure the city that all such items, expenses, and costs shall be paid in full, solely from revenues of the airport. 
(2)  If total landing fees of all airlines for any quarter vary by more than ten (10) percent from the projected total landing fees for such quarter, the landing fee rate may be adjusted for the balance of such fiscal year by an amount equal to the difference between projected and actual total landing fees divided by the estimated total landed weight of the airlines during the balance of such fiscal year.

Each on-airport rental car company shall include the CFC rate in all forms of reservations for automobile rentals and automobile rental advertisements at least thirty (30) days prior to the rate effective date. Reservations made thirty (30) days prior to a rate effective date shall be exempt from the CFC. Contracts entered into prior to a rate effective date shall also be exempt from the CFC.

Structures are limited to one thousand (1,000) square feet and do not include habitable structures (i.e., residence, shop). Structures must be located a minimum of twenty (20) feet from property lines and twenty (20) feet from other structures on the same lot. This does not exempt a developer from meeting local zoning standards. 
(2)  Section 106.3.4 is amended as follows: 
Section 106.3.4.1 Plans and Specifications. Plans, engineering calculations, diagrams and other data shall be submitted in one or more sets with each application for a permit. The building official shall require plans, computations and specifications to be prepared and designed by an engineer or architect licensed by the state to practice as such. 
EXCEPTION: The building official shall waive the submission calculations, etc., if the building official finds that the nature of the work applied for is such that reviewing of plans is not necessary to obtain compliance with this code. 
i.  The building official may accept plans, specifications and calculations which are not prepared by an engineer or architect for Group R, Division 1 occupancies not more than two (2) stories in height or having more than three thousand (3,000) square feet of floor area on a floor and for Group R, Division 3 and M occupancies of Type V Construction.

Footings of concrete and masonry shall be of solid material. Foundations supporting wood shall extend at least six (6) inches above the adjacent finish grade. Footings shall have a minimum depth below finished grade as indicated in Table 18-1-C unless another depth is recommended by a foundation investigation. Unless a foundation investigation indicates otherwise, local frost line shall be considered to be thirty-six (36) inches below grade as grade is defined in Section 208. Footings shall extend below frost line a minimum distance equal to the "thickness of footing" as specified in Table 18-1-C. 
EXCEPTION: Where a foundation design by an architect or engineer is not provided, footings of the minimum dimensions specified in Table 18-1-C at the perimeter of a slab on grade which do not carry a floor load need not extend below the frost line, provided that the supported structure is limited to one-story stud bearing wall construction housing a Group U, Division 1 occupancy. Such structure shall not be attached to or share a common wall with any other structure(s) unless the foundations have been designed to minimize differential vertical displacement. Structures shall not thereafter be changed in occupancy or number of stories without also meeting all of the requirements of Chapter 18 for new construction. The building official may require an inspection of existing foundations or slabs to verify any claims as to their adequacy prior to the approval of plans or issuance of a permit for change in occupancy or number of stories.

The city shall not issue the permit required by section 26-115 until the applicant has filed with the city engineering department a certificate of public liability insurance in the amount of seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($750,000.00) per claim and one and one-half million dollars ($1,500,000.00) per occurrence as outlined in section 2-9-108, MCA, conditioned to hold the city harmless from any damage or injury whatsoever to any person or property of any description, however owned, by reason of the licensee's failure or neglect to conform with any provisions of this article or other ordinance of the city relating to the installation of plumbing piping and equipment. 
    The insurance requirement can be met by purchasing and maintaining commercial general liability insurance, which shall include premises operations, independent contractor's protection, broad form property damage (including explosion, collapse, blasting and underground damage where applicable), products and completed operations coverage. 
    The general aggregate will apply separately to each of the contractor's projects by use of a "per project" general aggregate endorsement. The following limits will be secured at a minimum: 
Personal and advertising injury: $1,500,000.00 
Per occurrence: Bodily injury and property damage: $1,500,000.00 
General aggregate: $2,000,000.00 
Products and completed operations aggregate: $2,000,000.00 
Additional insured-City of Billings. 
    The contractor may satisfy the required limits by either general liability insurance or a combination of general liability insurance and excess (or umbrella) liability insurance. In the event the general aggregate limit is reduced by an amount greater than $500,000.00, the contractor will provide written notice to the city of this fact. 
    The city must be named as an additional insured on the liability insurance policy or policies. The city shall be notified in writing thirty (30) days prior to any cancellation or nonrenewal of the policy. The notice of cancellation must be sent to the city engineering department.

(2)  The interior width of the structure shall be at least eight (8) feet wide, and exterior dimensions shall not exceed fourteen (14) feet in width nor fourteen (14) feet in height. 
(3)  The lowest point of the structure shall not be less than fourteen (14) feet above the sidewalk at the building line, sixteen (16) feet above the gutter elevation at the curbline, and seventeen (17) feet above the centerline of the street. 
(4)  Windows shall be installed so as to provide at least seventy (70) percent interior wall transparency (exclusive of structural framing members) distributed evenly along its length so as to achieve an open character and reveal pedestrian use. The windows shall be constructed of a material that does not present a hazard in the event of breakage. 
(5)  The structural support for the skybridge shall be on private property or immediately adjacent to private property on a properly executed encroachment permit. Live loads and structural requirements shall be in accordance with the latest adopted edition of the Uniform Building code for seismic zone No. 1.

a.  Continuous guardrail-handrail shall be installed along each side of the skyway walkway; and 
b.  Level platforms shall be required as specified in the code at the top and bottom of the ramp, and at any doorways, but no other level platforms shall be required even if the ramp exceeds thirty (30) feet in length, unless the gradient exceeds four (4) percent. If the gradient exceeds four (4) percent, one level platform at least five (5) feet long shall be provided approximately at the midpoint of the ramp. 
(8)  There shall be no advertising, identification, messages or other private signs painted or mounted on the skyways, over the public right-of-way. Temporary decorations shall be allowed only if the permit or an amendment thereto specifically so provides, and subject to conditions stated in such permit or amendment. The city may, at its option, mount traffic-control devices from or on the skyway structure. 
(9)  Inconspicuous internal lighting shall be provided and maintained without expense to the city, in such manner that no glare will result which could be a hazard or nuisance to the streets or alleys below. Any external lighting shall also be inconspicuous and free of glare.

Sec. 6-1209. - Storm drainage control in areas north of Rimrocks. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for retention of surface water on certain lands described within this section where buildings and parking areas or driveways replace vacant land. The construction of buildings, parking areas, driveways and the like prevents the ground from retaining surface water and causes increased amounts of surface water to run off quickly onto lower lands, storm sewers, ditches and watercourses. This can overload the lower lands, storm sewers, ditches and watercourses, causing water to back up and causing flooding of public streets, public places and private places. This section requires the control and retention of surface water, making flooding less likely. 
(b)  Definitions. [As used in this section the following words and terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed:] 
    Affected area: This section shall apply only to the following described property: Sandcliff Subdivision; Sky Line Heights Subdivision; Lots 8, 9, 10 and 11 of High Acres Subdivision; Lot 5 of Skyline Subdivision; Lot 22 of Foote Subdivision; all of Certificate of Survey No. 1805.

DIVISION 3. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 6-1621. - Jurisdictional area. 
    These regulations apply only to the flood hazard areas specifically adopted herein as regulated flood hazard areas and are more fully and specifically described in division 4. The requirements and approvals for alterations to the specific jurisdictional area are in division 4 as well. Areas within the regulated flood hazard area also include areas specifically identified, labeled and illustrated on maps as floodplain, floodway, or flood fringe that have differing uses allowed and minimum building standards that apply. The jurisdictional areas are those inundated by the flood of 100-year frequency illustrated and depicted in the referenced studies and maps. 
    The regulated flood hazard area supporting study and maps illustrating the regulatory area are generally studies and maps completed for the DNRC and may include special flood hazard areas and flood insurance studies by FEMA or studies by others including the Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS) that have been adopted by DNRC pursuant to MCA 76-5-201, et seq. The maps and accompanying study become the regulatory flood hazard area only when formally adopted by DNRC and community within an ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 13-5616, § 2, 10-28-13) 
Sec. 6-1622. - Regulated flood hazard areas. 
(a)  The jurisdictional areas referenced herein as the regulated flood hazard area are the 100-year floodplains illustrated and referenced in the "Flood Insurance Study for Yellowstone County, Montana and Incorporated Areas" with an effective date of November 6, 2013 along with accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM). 
(b)  The regulated flood hazard area specifically described or illustrated in the specific study including maps that have been delineated, designated and established by order of the DNRC or FEMA pursuant to MCA 76-5-201. 
(c)  Use allowances, design and construction requirements specifically in sections 6-1622 and 6-1662 in these regulations vary by the specific areas identified as floodway and flood fringe. 
(Ord. No. 13-5616, § 2, 10-28-13) 
Sec. 6-1623. - Interpretation of regulated flood hazard area boundaries. 
(a)  The mapped boundaries illustrated in the referenced studies in this section are a guide for determining whether property is within the regulated flood hazard area. 
(b)  A determination of the outer limits and boundaries of the regulated flood hazard area or the flood fringe and floodway within the regulated flood hazard area includes an evaluation of the maps as well as the particular study data of the referenced study in this section. The supporting study material takes precedence over any map illustrations. 
(c)  The floodplain boundary is delineated by the base flood elevation. The actual intersection of the applicable study base flood elevations with the natural adjacent terrain of the watercourse or channel is the physical field floodplain regulatory boundary. 
(d)  The floodway boundary where identified within the floodplain is as illustrated on the referenced maps and studies. Since the floodway boundary is a study feature, the location of the boundary may be physically located by referencing the study data to a ground feature. The floodplain administrator's interpretation of the boundary and decision may be appealed as set forth in section 6-1652. 
(e)  If the floodplain administrator determines a proposed development is within the regulatory area: 
(1)  Where base flood elevations exist, the property owner may provide additional information which may include elevation information provided by an engineer or land surveyor in order to re-determine if the proposed development is subject to these regulations. 
(2)  Where base flood elevations do not exist, the property owner may provide additional information to be considered to re-determine the scaled location of the regulatory boundary or alternatively provide a computed base flood elevation provided by an engineer. 
(3)  The floodplain administrator's interpretation of the boundaries and decision may be appealed as set forth in section 6-1652. 
(f)  Any owner or lessee of property who believes his property has been inadvertently included in the floodplain including the floodway or flood fringe of the regulated flood hazard area may submit scientific and/or technical information to the floodplain administrator for a determination if the property is appropriately located. Scientific or technical information submitted to FEMA by an owner to affect the insurance rating for insurance purposes may be considered by the floodplain administrator. A determination by the floodplain administrator is independent of any determination by FEMA for insurance purposes. Any request for a FEMA determination of the flood insurance risk rating of a property or structure relative to the FEMA special flood hazard area is the responsibility of the owner or lessee. 
(Ord. No. 13-5616, § 2, 10-28-13) 
Sec. 6-1624. - Alteration of jurisdictional area. 
(a)  An alteration of the regulated flood hazard area is a DNRC approved amendment to the DNRC order that originally delineated and designated the 100-year floodplain and is the basis of the regulated flood hazard area referenced in section 6-1623. A DNRC approved alteration consists of revisions or updates to the specific maps and data of the referenced studies in this section and forms the basis for an amendment to the regulated flood hazard area in these regulations. 
(b)  Any alteration can only be implemented by an amendment to the regulated flood hazard area described in section 6-1623; 
(c)  An alteration of the regulated flood hazard area may be the result of DNRC consideration of substantial natural physical change or new technical or scientific flood data showing that the base flood elevation has or may be changed or was erroneously established.

Sec. 7-902. - Grant of franchise. 
(a)  Grant. The grantor hereby grants to the grantee a nonexclusive franchise which authorizes the grantee to construct and operate a cable system to provide cable services in, along, among, upon, across, above, over, under, or in any manner connected with public ways within the service area, and for that purpose to erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct, maintain, or retain in, on, over, under, upon, across, or along any public way a cable system for the purpose of providing cable service. This grant is not in lieu of any other grant that the city or state may require in connection with the use or occupancy of the public ways to provide any other service. 
(b)  Other ordinances. This franchise is subject to the laws and regulations of the city as now existing or as may hereafter be adopted. Provided that, neither party may unilaterally alter the express material rights and obligations set forth in this franchise. In the event of a conflict between the express material rights of grantee set forth in this franchise and any ordinance adopted after the date hereof and this franchise, the franchise shall control, provided however that the grantee agrees that it is subject to the lawful exercise of the police power of the grantor. Provided further, the right to use the public ways is subject to the continuing regulation by the city, the grant of this franchise is not in lieu of any permits or zoning approvals that may be required, or fees associated with the same; and the grant of the franchise does not give grantee the right to maintain its facilities at any particular location in the public ways, and instead the grantee shall have the duty to relocate or remove the same from time to time, as provided in this franchise or under laws or regulations now existing or hereafter adopted. 
(c)  Public hearing. Before issuing any other cable franchise or franchise to provide multi-channel video programming services, the city shall conduct a public hearing to determine whether an applicant's proposal meets the future cable-related needs and interests of the community and any impact on the existing provision of cable service, except where such a hearing would be inconsistent with applicable laws and regulations. Grantee shall be notified of that hearing, and shall be given an opportunity to appear at the hearing and address issues relevant to the issuance of the franchise, except that nothing in this paragraph requires the city to take any action that would result in a violation of applicable laws and regulations, or that prevent it from acting prior the expiration of any deadline. 
(d)  Term. The franchise granted hereunder shall be for an initial term of five (5) years commencing on the effective date of the franchise as set forth in subsection 7-909(g), unless otherwise lawfully terminated in accordance with the terms of this franchise. 
(Ord. No. 08-5472, § 2, 6-9-08) 
Sec. 7-903. - Standards of service. 
(a)  General. This section sets forth minimum standards for service, and does not affect the city's rights as reserved under section 7-902. All acts a grantee is required to perform are at its expense, and at no expense to the city. 
(b)  Conditions of occupancy. The cable system installed by the grantee pursuant to the terms hereof shall be located so as to cause a minimum of interference with the proper use of public ways and with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who own property that adjoins any of such public ways. 
(c)  Restoration of public ways. If during the course of the grantee's construction, operation, or maintenance of the cable system there occurs a disturbance of any public way by the grantee, grantee shall replace and restore such public way to a condition better than, or equal to, the condition of the public way existing immediately prior to such disturbance. 
(d)  Relocation for the grantor. Upon its receipt of reasonable advance written notice, to be not less than five (5) business days, the grantee at its expense shall protect, support, raise, lower, temporarily disconnect, relocate in or remove from the public way, any property of the grantee when required by the grantor or any government entity by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street abandonment, freeway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, gas or water pipes, or any other type of public structures or improvements. The grantee shall in all cases have the right of abandonment of its property,, provided that, if property is abandoned, grantee upon request must provide grantor title to the property, free and clear of encumbrances. 
(e)  Relocation for a third party. The grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a lawful permit issued by the grantor, protect, support, raise, lower, temporarily disconnect, relocate in or remove from the public way as necessary any property of the grantee, provided: 
(1)  The expense of such is paid by said person benefiting from the relocation, including, if required by the grantee, making such payment in advance; and 
(2)  The grantee is given reasonable advance written notice to prepare for such changes. 
    For purposes of this subsection, "reasonable advance written notice" shall be no less than ten (10) business days in the event of a temporary relocation, and as promptly as possible for a permanent relocation, considering the work to be performed in connection with that relocation. 
(f)  Relocation for a person authorized to place facilities in rights of way. Grantee shall promptly protect, support, raise, lower, temporarily disconnect, relocate in or remove from the public way as necessary any property of the grantee as required to enable another person authorized to place facilities in the rights of way (other than a person described in subsections 7-903(d) and (e) to construct, modify, repair or maintain such facilities, with the cost therefore to be borne in accordance with applicable law. 
(g)  Trimming of trees and shrubbery. The grantee shall have the authority to trim trees or other natural growth in order to access and maintain the cable system, subject to the supervision of the city. Nothing in this section relieves grantee of any liability it may have to persons for damage caused to public or private property. 
(h)  Safety requirements. Construction, operation, and maintenance of the cable system shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All such work shall be performed in substantial accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations and the National Electric Safety Code and the National Electrical Code. The cable system shall not endanger or unreasonably interfere with the safety of persons or property in the service area. 
(i)  Underground construction. In those areas of the service area where all of the distribution facilities of the incumbent local exchange carrier or distribution lines of public utilities providing electric services are underground, the grantee likewise shall construct, operate, and maintain its cable system underground. 
(j)  Required extensions of the cable system. Whenever the grantee receives a request for cable service from a subscriber in a contiguous unserved area where there are at least ten (10) residential units that would be passed by an extension of 1320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable mile) from the portion of the grantee's trunk or distribution cable which is to be extended, it shall extend its cable system to such subscribers at no cost to said subscribers for the cable system extension, other than the published standard/non-standard installation fees for drops charged to all subscribers. 
(k)  Subscriber charges for extensions of the cable system. No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, if an area does not meet the density requirements of subsection (j), the grantee shall only be required to extend the cable system to subscriber(s) in that area if the subscriber(s) are willing to share the capital costs of extending the cable system. Specifically, the grantee shall contribute a capital amount equal to the construction cost per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences per 1320 cable-bearing strand feet from the grantee's trunk or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals ten (10). Subscribers who request service hereunder shall bear the remaining cost to extend the cable system on a pro rata basis. The grantee may require that payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance. Subscribers shall also be responsible for any standard and non-standard installation fees for drops. 
(l)  Cable service to public buildings. The grantee, shall maintain and continue to provide free services to all public buildings to which it was providing free service as of January 1, 2008, and upon request, shall provide without charge, a standard installation and one outlet of basic cable to those administrative buildings owned and occupied by the grantor, fire station(s), police station(s), and K-12 public school(s) existing as of January 1, 2008. For such additional buildings as may be added after January 1, 2008, Grantee shall provide a free outlet of basic service upon request, provided that, if the person requesting service is more than three hundred fifty (350) feet from the cable system, the company shall provide free service and an extension upon request, if the person requesting service agrees to pay the additional incremental cost of drop installation beyond the cost for the first three hundred fifty (350) feet. The cable service provided shall not be used for commercial purposes, and such outlets shall not be located in areas open to, and used continuously by the general public (students are not treated as part of the general public for purposes of this paragraph). The grantor shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the grantee's cable system in buildings owned or controlled by grantor in any manner that results in the inappropriate use thereof or any loss or damage to the cable system. Each building may extend the service from the free outlet to other locations, and grantee shall provide power levels to the building to permit service to be so extended. If additional amplifiers are required in the building, the grantee may charge its actual cost of the amplifier. 
(m)  Emergency use. If the grantee provides an emergency alert system ("EAS"), then the grantor shall permit only appropriately trained and authorized persons to operate the EAS equipment and shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the grantee's cable system in any manner that results in inappropriate use thereof, or any loss or damage to the cable system. 
(Ord. No. 08-5472, § 2, 6-9-08) 
Sec. 7-904. - Regulation by the grantor 
(a)  Franchise fee. 
(1)  The grantee shall pay to the grantor an annual franchise fee of five (5) percent of annual gross revenue (as defined in section 7-901). Each payment shall be accompanied by a report prepared by a representative of the grantee showing the basis for the computation, containing such information as the city may require to determine whether fees are being paid as required, and attested to as accurate by an officer of the grantee. 
(2)  Limitation on franchise fee actions. The period of limitation for recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be three (3) years from the date on which payment by the grantee is due. 
(3)  Grantor shall have the right to review and copy the books and records of the grantee, and any person receiving revenues subject to the franchise fee hereunder, and grantee shall be responsible for obtaining and providing such books and records to the city for its review at city hall, or such other location as the parties may agree. 
(4)  No acceptance of any payment by the city shall be construed as a release or an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee or for the performance of any other obligation of franchisee. 
(b)  Rates and charges. The grantor may regulate rates and charges except to the extent preempted from doing so by federal or state law. 
(c)  Transfer of franchise. The grantee's right, title, or interest in the franchise shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered, other than to an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the grantee as of the effective date, without the prior consent of the grantor, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. A change of control of grantee or entities controlling grantee shall be treated as a transfer. No such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the grantee in the franchise or cable system in order to secure indebtedness, provided that no such instrument permits any person to succeed to the ownership or control of the system without the approval of the city. Without limiting the other provisions of this franchise, grantor and grantee shall comply with any federal regulations governing transfer of cable systems. In deciding whether to grant or deny a request for transfer, the city may consider any factors it may consider under applicable law, including without limitation the financial, technical and legal qualifications of the transferee, whether the grantee is in compliance with its obligations, and the effect of the transfer on the city or subscribers. City may deny a transfer application for failure of grantee or transferee to respond to reasonable requests for information regarding the transfer. A request for approval of a transfer will not be unreasonably withheld. 
(Ord. No. 08-5472, § 2, 6-9-08) 
Sec. 7-905. - Books and records. 
(a)  The grantee agrees that the grantor, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the grantee, may review and copy such of its books and records at the grantee's business office, during normal business hours and on a nondisruptive basis, as is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this franchise, or applicable law, or to carry out any of the city's obligations under the same. Such notice shall reference the section of the franchise or applicable law giving rise to the request, so that the grantee may organize the necessary books and records for easy access by the grantor. The grantee shall not be required to maintain any books and records for franchise compliance purposes longer than three (3) years, other than revenue information, which must be maintained for at least five (5) years. Grantor agrees that it will not disclose information provided to it which is marked as confidential or proprietary, except as required to do so by state public records statutes or by court order. The grantee shall not be required to provide subscriber information in violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act, and shall redact any such information. 
(b)  Upon request, grantee shall provide the city with maps of its system as built, in hard copy or, if the city requests it, in an electronic format compatible with the city's mapping systems. 
(c)  Grantor may require grantee to produce reports reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this franchise, or applicable law, or to carry out any of the city's obligations under the same.

Sec. 7-906. - Insurance and indemnification. 
(a)  Insurance requirements. The grantee shall maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and expense, during the term of the franchise, commercial general liability insurance in the amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000.00) combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage. The grantor shall be designated as an additional insured. Such insurance shall be noncancellable except upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the grantor. The grantee shall provide a certificate of insurance showing evidence of the coverage required by this subsection. 
(b)  Indemnification. Grantee shall indemnify, save harmless and defend the city, its mayor and council, appointed boards and commissions, officers and employees, (collectively "city and its agents") individually and collectively from all fines, liens, suits, claims, demands, actions, costs of litigation, attorneys' fees, judgments or liability of any kind ("losses") (including but not limited to libel, slander, invasion of privacy, unauthorized use of any trademark, trade name or service mark, copyright infringement, injury, death or damage to person or property) arising out of or in any way connected with the installation, construction, operation, maintenance or condition of the cable system. The city shall give grantee timely written notice of the making of any claim or the commencement of any action, suit or other proceeding covered by the indemnity of this section, where grantee is not a party thereto. 
(Ord. No. 08-5472, § 2, 6-9-08) 
Sec. 7-907. - Enforcement and termination of franchise. 
(a)  Violation. In the event that the grantor believes that the grantee has not complied with the terms of the franchise, or applicable law, the city may commence a proceeding in any court or agency of competent jurisdiction, and take such other actions as are permitted under this section, or other applicable law. 
(b)  Liquidated damages. Franchisee and city agree to the following liquidated damages for the following violations. The parties agree that the liquidated damage amounts are in 2008 dollars and, upon notice from city, may be increased once every three (3) years by the increase in the U.S. city average of the consumer price index. Damages accrue from the date of the violation; provided that, nothing herein prevents franchisee from raising a defense to the imposition of liquidated damages from the date of violation based upon laches, waiver, statute of limitations, or any other similar defense. 
(1)  For transferring this franchise without required approval: One thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day for each violation for each day the violation continues.

(3)  For violation of customer service standards: One hundred dollars ($100.00) per violation, except that for violations of customer service standards, such as telephone answering standards, where the operator's compliance is not measured in terms of its response to individual customers, one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) a month for any period during which franchisee fails to meet applicable performance standards; and 
(4)  For all other material violations of this franchise for which actual damages may not be ascertainable: Two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for each violation for each day the violation continues. 
(c)  Imposition of liquidated damages. The city may impose liquidated damages in accordance with the procedures in this section. The city shall provide franchisee written notice describing with reasonable specificity the alleged noncompliance, and provide franchisee with an opportunity to be heard at a public meeting, to show either that a violation has not occurred or that damages should not be imposed. The written notice shall be provided at least sixty (60) days prior to any hearing on the alleged noncompliance. 
(d)  Nature of liquidated damages. These sums are agreed upon as reasonable liquidated damages, developed in accordance with state law, and are not penalties. 
(e)  Revocation of franchise. The city shall have the right to terminate, revoke or shorten the term of this franchise for the reasons specified in the cable ordinance as of the effective date of this franchise, pursuant to the procedures specified in the cable ordinance. Provided that, any amendments to the cable ordinance shall provide the same level of due process as is provided under the procedures provided for under the cable ordinance as the same existed on the effective date of this franchise. 
(f)  Force majeure.

(b)  Preservation of existing benefits. Grantee shall continue to provide and maintain pathways and equipment associated with carrying the PEG channels that it was providing prior to and upon the effective date of this franchise until and unless the city notifies grantee that such support is no longer necessary. 
(c)  Provision of channel capacity for PEG use. In the event that the grantee cable system would transition to an "all digital" cable network, upon request grantee shall provide up to one additional digital channel for public, educational or government use on the basic service tier, when the usage triggers described in subsection (n) are satisfied.

The links shall be designed to serve as a program origination point, and as a playback center for programming on any PEG channel. 
a.  To one additional location at its cost, so long as the location is within 2640 cable bearing strand feet of the then-existing cable distribution network and any required land-owner permission is obtained; 
b.  To additional locations where the grantee's then-existing cable distribution network is already in place (Dehler Field being such a location); 
c.  At the incremental cost of extending the nearest available fiber to the location, where subsections a. and b. do not apply. 
The obligations under this section include the responsibility to provide equipment necessary to place the signal on the system, and to route signals to the appropriate PEG channel, all without any noticeable PEG signal deterioration. Grantee is not responsible for any production equipment. 
(2)  If grantee makes changes to its system that necessitate modifications to PEG facilities and equipment, including but not limited to the links, grantee shall provide any additional facilities or equipment necessary to implement such modifications within thirty (30) days of the date that the system changes are made, so that PEG facilities and equipment may be used and operated as intended.

(1)  Grantee may be required to pay up to eighty-five cents ($0.85) per subscriber per month for such support, beginning sixty (60) days after adoption of a resolution adopted by the city after at a public meeting.

(2)  Grantee shall provide a lump sum amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), with one-half (1/2) due within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this agreement, and one-half (1/2) due on the anniversary of the effective date. 
(j)  Channel location.

Grantee shall pay reasonable expenses associated with a change in the PEG channel positions, up to three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per change. Grantee shall also provide up to two (2) 15-second slots per day, on the channel previously occupied by a PEG channel, mixed over morning, afternoon, evening and late night time slots, for thirty (30) days after a change in channel positions, subject to restrictions on ad inserts in grantee's contract with the applicable programmer. Grantee shall not change the channel position for the government channel designated by the city, without the city's consent unless the change is required by federal law. City consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 
(k)  Video on demand. As of the adoption of this article, grantee has only recently begun to offer local video on demand content. Grantee is willing to make the city a test bed for local video on demand programming, and grantor agrees to use its best efforts to implement PEG video on demand in the city. Grantor agrees to work cooperatively with grantee in this effort, and to explore and develop operational and technical procedures for submitting, storing, adding, removing and tagging such programming, in a manner that is financially and technically feasible for both parties. 
(l)  No charge for use. The facilities, equipment and channel capacity provided for PEG use shall be available at no charge from grantee to users, to the city or to any entity responsible for managing a PEG channel. In the event separate resolution is enacted per subsection (i)(1), the city recognizes that grantee intends to pass those costs on to users, at its discretion. 
(m)  Support not a franchise fee. The parties agree that any cost to the company associated with providing any support for PEG use required under this franchise shall not constitute a franchise fee within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. § 542, and shall be deemed to fall within one or more of the exceptions listed in 47 U.S.C. § 542(g)(2). 
(n)  Usage triggers. Satisfying any one of the following triggers shall entitle the city to the additional channel provided for in this section.

(2)  If all channels designated for a particular use (e.g., educational use) are being programmed at least eighty (80) hours per week over a consecutive 16-week period, an additional channel shall be provided for that particular use upon request by the city. 
(3)  If the city desires a governmental channel and there is no designated governmental channel, the city can show that there is a regular conflict over a consecutive 16-week period between programming it would carry and programming being carried on PEG channels. 
    The term "repeat program" means the running time of any program to the extent that it is shown more than four (4) times during the test period. Repeat programs are counted only to a maximum of twenty-five (25) percent of total hours for purposes of the tests in paragraphs (1) and (2).

ARTICLE 7-1300. - ADULT MOVIE VIDEO BOOTHS/DEVICES 

Sec. 7-1301. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to recognize and to provide for the fact that the operation of mechanical amusement devices which depict or display specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas results in increased enforcement problems for the city and additional expense to the city that justifies a license fee. This necessitates greater police vigilance to assure that the lawful business of displaying nonobscene portrayals or depictions of sexual conduct is not used inadvertently or by design as the means of unlawful displaying or depicting of obscenity. In order to recoup some of the costs thus imposed on the city, it is appropriate that there be imposed on the persons who profit from such devices some of the costs of ensuring that the devices are used only lawfully. 
(Ord. No. 87-4747, 9-28-87) 
Sec. 7-1302. - Definition. 
    A "device" under this article shall include any machine which, upon the insertion of a coin or the payment of consideration, depicts, displays, or projects directly or indirectly pictures, photographs or other visual images of [specified] anatomical areas or specified sexual activities. 
(a)  Specified anatomical areas: 
(1)  Less than completely and opaquely covered: 
a.  Human genitals, pubic region; 
b.  Buttock; 
c.  Female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola; and 
(2)  Human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state, even if completely and opaquely covered. 
(b)  Specified sexual activities: 
(1)  Human genitals in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal; 
(2)  Acts of human masturbation, sexual intercourse or sodomy; 
(3)  Fondling of human genitals, pubic region, buttock or female breast. 
(Ord. No. 87-4747, 9-28-87) 
Sec. 7-1303. - License-Required. 
    The city hereby imposes licensing requirements on each device operated by anyone within the city. No person shall offer or allow the operation of any device without having first procured and thereafter maintained in full force and effect a license issued by the city for each device. 
(Ord. No. 87-4747, 9-28-87) 
Sec. 7-1304. - Same-Application. 
    Application shall be made to the city administrator on a form supplied by him and shall contain in addition to the applicant's name, address and general information required, a complete list of the devices owned or operated by him with an indication thereon of the location of each device. 
(Ord. No. 87-4747, § 1, 9-28-87) 
Sec. 7-1305. - Same-Fee. 
    The fee for the license of a device under this article shall be in an amount as prescribed by council resolution. The fee shall be paid to the city and shall be pro-rated semi-annually. All device licenses shall expire at midnight on June thirtieth of each year. No license fee, in part or whole, will be refunded after a license is issued, regardless of whether the license is used after issuance.

Ord. No. 00-5133 replaced those provisions found in former §§ 7-1401-7-1403 with the current provisions of 7-1401-7-1419 as set out herein. Former §§ 7-1401-7-1403 derived from Ord. No. 92-4908, Art. I, § 1.1, Art. II, §§ 2.1-2.9 and Art. III, adopted August 16, 1992. 

Sec. 7-1401. - Title. 
    This article shall be known and cited as the "City of Billings Right-of-Way Management Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 00-5133, § 2, 10-23-00) 
Sec. 7-1402. - Authority. 
    This article is adopted pursuant to the city's self-government powers including but not limited to those set forth in its Charter, Title XI of the Montana State Constitution, Title 7 of the Montana Code Annotated, and Section 253 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. § 253. 
(Ord. No. 00-5133, § 3, 10-23-00) 
Sec. 7-1403. - Legislative findings. 
    The city council hereby finds and declares: 
(1)  That the city has strong self-government powers which the city may exercise to protect, manage, and steward development and use of the public rights-of-way; and 
(2)  That the public rights-of-way within the city are used and useful for the travel of persons and the transport of goods and other tangibles in the business and social life of the community by all citizens; and 
(3)  That the public rights-of-way within the city can be partially occupied by utilities and other public service entities for facilities used in the delivery, conveyance, and transmission of utility, telecommunications, and public services rendered for profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general economic well-being of the city and its citizens; and 
(4)  That the public rights-of-way within the city are physically limited so that proper management by the city is necessary to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the taxpayers of the foregoing uses, to prevent foreclosure of future uses through premature exhaustion of available right-of-way capacity, and to minimize the inconvenience to the public from such facilities' construction, emplacement, relocation, and maintenance in the rights-of-way; and 
(5)  That the public rights-of-way within the city are valuable public property acquired and maintained by the state and the city at great expense to the taxpayers; and 
(6)  That the city has a fiduciary duty not to give away public property for private use without just compensation; and 
(7)  That the right to occupy portions of such public rights-of-way for limited times for the business of operating communications and utility facilities and providing telecommunications and utility services is a valuable economic asset, without which a user would be required to invest substantial capital, and that the public deserves fair and reasonable compensation for the property held by the city and made available to private entities providing for-profit services. 
(Ord. No. 00-5133, § 4, 10-23-00) 
Sec. 7-1404. - Purposes. 
    The city council adopts this article to better: 
(1)  Manage a limited resource to the long-term benefit of the public; and 
(2)  Protect the public rights-of-way from damage and unauthorized encroachment; and 
(3)  Minimize inconvenience of the public occasioned by the emplacement and maintenance of telecommunications and utilities facilities in the public rights-of-way; and 
(4)  Recover the burden imposed on taxpayers by occupation of the public rights-of-way by non-governmental businesses; and 
(5)  Recover fair compensation for those parts of the rights-of-way occupied by non-governmental entities in their respective businesses; and 
(6)  Prevent premature exhaustion of capacity in the public rights-of-way to accommodate telecommunications, utility, and other public services.

(e)  Except as otherwise expressly provided in a franchise, license or lease agreement, the city shall have the right to co-locate proprietary communication facilities upon or within poles, antennae or conduits owned by a franchise-holder, license-holder or lease-holder without payment therefore, provided that such proprietary communication facilities do not interfere with the franchise-holder's, license-holder's or lease-holder's own use of such poles, antennae or conduits; and provided further that such proprietary communication facilities are not used to provide telecommunications service.

(h)  The failure of the city to insist on timely performance or compliance by any person holding a franchise, license, lease, or work permit shall not constitute a waiver of the city's right to later insist on timely performance or compliance by that person or any other person holding such a franchise, license, lease, or work permit.

(2)  The cost of acquiring, improving and maintaining the public rights-of-way and the effect thereon of the use authorized by the license;

The amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be provided in the franchise, license, or lease agreement, or by reference to the application therefore, or as provided in separate title of this article, but shall in no event be less than the cost of removal of the communications or utility facilities authorized by such franchise, license, or lease, and the restoration of the public rights-of-way to its original condition. 
(b)  Such bond or letter of credit shall be obtained at the sole expense of the franchise-holder, license-holder or lease-holder and remain in effect for the full term of the franchise, license or lease, and for six (6) months following its expiration or termination; provided, however, that the amount of such bond or letter of credit may be reduced upon application by the franchise-holder, license-holder, or lease-holder after substantial completion of the excavation and construction activities, and the installation or emplacement of communications facilities or utility facilities authorized by the franchise, license, or lease, to such amount as may be necessary or appropriate to guarantee the performance of the franchise-holder's, license-holder's, or lease-holder's future obligations under this ordinance and/or the franchise, license, or lease granted hereunder, as may be finally determined by the city administrator, but in no event less than the cost of removal of the facilities authorized by such franchise, license, or lease, and the restoration of the public rights-of-way to its original condition. 
(c)  The franchise-holder, license-holder, or lease-holder and its surety or issuer shall be jointly and severally liable for any damages or loss suffered by the city, including statutory damages, or penalties assessed hereunder, as a result of a breach of a franchise, license, or lease agreement or violation of this article, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal of any property of the franchise-holder, license-holder, or lease-holder, and a reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs, up to the full amount of the bond. 
(d)  The bond or letter of credit shall provide for not less than 60-days' prior written notice to the city administrator prior to cancellation, expiration, or material alteration of its terms.

(f)  The rights of the city under any bond, letter of credit or other security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city whether reserved by this article or authorized by other law or the franchise, license, or lease agreement, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such bond or letter of credit will affect any other right the city may have. 
(g)  Each franchise-holder, license-holder, and lease-holder shall maintain throughout the term of the franchise, license, or lease, any renewal thereof, and for six (6) months thereafter, comprehensive general liability insurance in such amount as may be required under the terms of the franchise, license, or lease agreement, or by reference to the application therefore, as determined necessary and appropriate by the city administrator or council to cover property damage and personal injury which may be foreseeable in connection with the activity authorized by the franchise, license, or lease. A certificate of such insurance shall be filed with the city administrator in form satisfactory to the city administrator. 
(h)  A franchise, license, or lease agreement may require that each insurance policy name as additional insureds the city, and/or any board, commission, agency, or other authority, and the members, officers, agents, and/or employees thereof. 
(i)  Each insurance policy required hereunder shall provide that coverage may not be canceled or reduced except upon 60-days' prior written notice to the city administrator. A franchise-holder, license-holder, or lease-holder shall not cancel any insurance policy required hereunder without first securing a substitute policy in compliance with this article. 
(j)  Neither the provisions of this section nor any recovery under the insurance policy hereby required shall be construed to limit the liability of a franchise-holder, license-holder, or lease-holder for damages arising out of its activities pursuant to any franchise, license, or lease granted hereunder. 
(k)  Qualifications of sureties. All insurance policies and bonds required hereunder shall be issued by sureties which are qualified to do business in this state and which are rated A-1 or better by Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition; and in a form approved by the city administrator.

(Ord. No. 05-5325, § 1, 5-9-05) 
Sec. 7-1503. - Franchise term. 
    The term of the franchise granted hereunder shall be for the period commencing upon the effective date of this article through and extending for fifteen (15) years therefrom. 
(Ord. No. 05-5325, § 1, 5-9-05) 
Sec. 7-1504. - Fees or taxes. 
    As a material term of this franchise agreement, and in consideration of the right granted to utility to occupy city rights-of-way for the purpose of operating a gas utility within the city, utility agrees: 
(1)  Subject to subsection (3) of this section, to timely pay all fees or taxes currently adopted, or as hereinafter may be adopted by the city pertaining to the utility's operations within the city. 
(2)  Proceeds of any fee or tax shall be distributed to the city in accordance with the terms of any adopting document or, if not specified in such document, no later than thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter (quarters ending at the end of March, June, September and December). 
(3)  Neither this section nor the utility's acceptance of the franchise granted by this section precludes the utility from challenging the lawfulness of any fee or tax imposed by the city upon the utility. If the utility successfully challenges the legality of a fee or tax adopted by the city or the city is otherwise prevented by judicial or legislative action from collecting a fee or tax adopted by the city or any portions thereof, then the utility shall be excused from the collection and distribution of that portion of the fee or tax. 
(Ord. No. 05-5325, § 1, 5-9-05; Ord. No. 05-5338, § 1, 8-22-05) 
Sec. 7-1505. - City ordinances and regulations. 
    Nothing herein shall be deemed to direct or restrict the city's ability to adopt and enforce all necessary and appropriate ordinances regulating the performance of the conditions of this franchise, including any reasonable ordinance made in the exercise of its police powers in the interest of public safety and for the welfare of the public. The city shall have the authority at all times to control, by appropriate regulations, the location, elevation, and manner of construction and maintenance of any facilities of utility located within the city right-of-way. Utility shall promptly conform with all such regulations, unless compliance would cause utility to violate other requirements of law. 
(Ord. No. 05-5325, § 1, 5-9-05) 
Sec. 7-1506. - Right-of-way management. 
(a)  Excavation. 
(1)  During any period of relocation or maintenance, all surface structures, if any, shall be erected and used in such places and positions within the right-of-way so as to interfere as little as possible with the safe and unobstructed passage of traffic and the unobstructed use of adjoining property. Utility shall at all times post and maintain proper barricades and comply with all applicable safety regulations during such period of construction as required by the city ordinances or traffic control plans approved by the city consistent with state law and MPWS Section 01570 as modified by the city. 
(2)  Whenever utility excavates in any right-of-way for the purpose of installation, construction, repair, maintenance or relocation of its facilities, it shall apply to the city for a permit to do so in compliance with the ordinances and regulations of the city requiring permits to operate in the right-of-way. In no case shall any such work commence within any right-of-way without a permit, except as otherwise provided in this article. During the progress of the work, utility shall not unnecessarily obstruct the passage or use of the right-of-way, and shall provide the city with plans, maps, and information showing the proposed and final location of any facilities in accordance with subsection (i) herein. 
(b)  Abandonment of utility's facilities. Facilities laid, installed, constructed, or maintained in the right-of-way by utility may be abandoned in place after notification of such intent is provided to the city. The city may require removal of abandoned facilities in conjunction with the process described in subsection (h). All necessary permits must be obtained prior to commencing removal. 
(c)  Restoration after construction. 
(1)  Utility shall, after any installation, construction, relocation, maintenance, or repair of facilities within the franchise area, restore the right-of-way to at least the condition the same was in immediately prior to any such abandonment, installation, construction, relocation, maintenance or repair as determined by the city engineer or designee. All concrete encased monuments, which have been disturbed or displaced by such work, shall be restored pursuant to all federal, state and local standards and specifications. Utility agrees to promptly complete all restoration work and to promptly repair any damage caused by such work at its sole cost and expense. 
(2)  If it is determined that utility has failed to restore the right-of-way in accordance with this section, the city shall provide utility with written notice including a description of actions the city believes necessary to restore the right-of-way. If the right-of-way is not restored in accordance with the city's notice within fifteen (15) days of that notice, the city, or its authorized agent, may restore the right-of-way. Upon request from the utility, the city may agree to an extension to the time provided to restore the right-of-way as long as doing so does not endanger the public. Utility is responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by the city in restoring the right-of-way in accordance with this section. The rights reserved to the city under this paragraph shall be in addition to those otherwise provided by this franchise. 
(d)  Bonding requirement. Utility must comply with the city's standard bonding requirement for working in the city's right-of-way. 
(e)  Emergency work, permit waiver. In the event of any emergency where any facilities located in the right-of-way are broken or damaged, or if utility's construction area for their facilities is in such a condition as to place the health or safety of any person or property in imminent danger, utility shall immediately take any necessary emergency measures to repair or remove its facilities without first applying for and obtaining a permit as required by this franchise. However, this emergency provision shall not relieve utility from later obtaining any necessary permits for the emergency work. Utility shall apply for the required permits the next business day following the emergency work or as soon as practical given the nature and duration of the emergency. 
(f)  Safety. 
(1)  The utility, in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local safety rules and regulations shall, at all times, employ ordinary care in the installation, maintenance, and repair utilizing methods and devices commonly accepted in their industry of operation to prevent failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to persons or property. 
(2)  All of utility's facilities in the right-of-way shall be constructed and maintained in a safe and operational condition. 
(g)  Dangerous conditions, authority for city to abate. 
(1)  Whenever facilities or the operations of the utility cause or contribute to a condition that appears to endanger any person or substantially impair the lateral support of the adjoining right-of-way, public or private property, the director may direct the utility, at no charge or expense to the city, to take actions to resolve the condition or remove the endangerment. Such directive may include compliance within a prescribed time period. 
(2)  In the event the utility fails or refuses to promptly take the directed action, or fails to fully comply with such direction, or if emergency conditions exist which require immediate action to prevent imminent injury or damages to persons or property, the city may take such actions as it believes are necessary to protect persons or property and the utility shall be responsible to reimburse the city for its costs. 
(h)  Relocation of system facilities. 
(1)  Utility agrees and covenants to protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove from any right-of-way its facilities without cost to the city, when so required by the city to facilitate the completion of or as a result of a public project, provided that utility shall in all such cases have the privilege to temporarily bypass, in the authorized portion of the same right-of-way and upon approval by the city, any facilities required to be temporarily disconnected or removed. As used in this section, the term "public project" is a project included in any city adopted capital improvement program. 
(2)  All facilities utilized for providing gas distribution service within utility's service area and within the right-of-way shall be considered owned, operated and maintained by utility. 
(3)  If the city determines that a public project necessitates the relocation of utility's existing facilities, the city shall utilize the following process unless otherwise agreed: 
a.  As soon as possible, but not less than sixty (60) days prior to the commencement of such project, provide utility with written notice requiring such relocation; and 
b.  Provide utility with copies of any plans and specifications pertinent to the requested relocation and a proposed temporary or permanent relocation for utility's facilities. 
c.  After receipt of such notice and such plans and specifications, utility shall complete relocation of its facilities at no charge or expense to the city at least ten (10) days prior to commencement of the project, unless otherwise agreed. 
(4)  Utility may, after receipt of written notice requesting a relocation of its facilities, submit to the city written alternatives to such relocation. The city shall evaluate such alternatives and advise utility in writing if any of the alternatives are suitable to accommodate the work that necessitates the relocation of the facilities. If so requested by the city, utility shall submit additional information to assist the city in making such evaluation. The city shall give each alternative proposed by utility full and fair consideration. In the event the city ultimately determines that there is no other reasonable alternative, utility shall relocate its facilities as provided in this section. 
(5)  The provisions of subsection (h) herein shall not preclude the utility from seeking reimbursement for relocation expenses from state or federal resources as long as doing so does not impair the interests of the city. 
(6)  The provisions of subsection (h) herein shall in no manner preclude or restrict utility from making any arrangements it may deem appropriate when responding to a request for relocation of its facilities by any person other than the city, where the improvements to be constructed by said person are not or will not become city owned, operated or maintained, provided that such arrangements do not unduly delay or increase the cost of a planned city construction project. 
(i)  Utility's maps and records. 
(1)  As a condition of this franchise, and without charge to the city, utility agrees to provide the city with record plans, maps, and records that show the vertical and horizontal location of its facilities within the right-of-way using a minimum scale of one inch equals one hundred feet (1"=100'). This information is to be provided in digital format that can be readily imported into the city's geographic information system (GIS), and, upon request, in hard copy plan form used by utility. This information shall be provided between one hundred twenty (120) and one hundred eighty (180) days of the effective date of this article and shall be updated by the utility utilizing information in their possession upon reasonable request by the city. 
(2)  The city will keep the information provided by the utility confidential to the extent allowed by law. If the city gets a records request demanding disclosure of utility system information previously provided to the city by the utility, then the city will provide the utility notice of such request and provide the utility the opportunity to seek to prevent the disclosure of said information through appropriate legal action. 
(Ord. No. 05-5325, § 1, 5-9-05) 
Sec. 7-1507. - Planning coordination. 
(a)  System information. Utility shall submit information related to the general location, proposed location, and size of all existing and proposed facilities within the city as requested by the director within a reasonable time, not exceeding sixty (60) days from receipt of a written request for such information. 
(1)  Utility will update information provided to the city under this section whenever there are major changes in utility's system plans for the city. 
(2)  The city will provide information relevant to the utility's operations within a reasonable period of written request to assist the utility in the development or update of its system plan. Provided that such information is in the city's possession, or can be reasonably developed from the information in the city's possession. 
(b)  System development information. Utility will assign a representative whose responsibility shall be to coordinate with the city on planning for capital improvement program projects. At a minimum, such coordination shall include the following: 
(1)  By October 31st of each year, utility shall provide the director with a schedule of its planned capital improvements for the following calendar year, which may affect the right-of-way for that year; 
(2)  Utility shall meet with the city, other franchisees and users of the right-of-way, according to a schedule to be determined by the city, to schedule and coordinate construction; and 
(3)  All construction locations, activities, and schedules shall be coordinated, as required by the director to minimize public inconvenience, disruption, or damages. 
(c)  Emergency operations. The city and utility agree to cooperate in the planning and implementation of emergency operations response procedures. 
(Ord. No. 05-5325, § 1, 5-9-05) 
Sec. 7-1508. - Indemnification. 
(a)  Utility hereby releases, covenants not to bring suit, and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the city, its elected officials, employees, agents, and volunteers from any and all claims, costs, judgments, awards, attorney's fees, or liability to any person, including claims by utility's own employees to which utility might otherwise be immune, arising from personal injury or damage to property allegedly due to the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of utility, its agents, servants, officers or employees in performing activities authorized by this franchise. This covenant of indemnification shall include, but not be limited by this reference, claims against the city arising as a result of the acts or omissions of utility, its agents, servants, officers or employees except for claims for injuries and damages caused by the sole negligence of the city. If final judgment is rendered against the city, its elected officials, employees, agents, and volunteers, or any of them, utility shall satisfy and pay the judgment. The city may appear in any proceeding it deems necessary to protect the city's or the public's interests. 
(b)  Inspection or acceptance by the city of any work performed by utility at the time of completion of construction shall not be grounds for avoidance of any of these covenants of indemnification. These indemnification obligations of utility in subsection (a) shall extend to and include any and all claims that have not yet resulted in a suit and any asserted or submitted claims that may be settled prior to the culmination of any litigation or the institution of any litigation. 
(c)  In the event utility refuses to undertake the defense of any filed suit or any claim asserted against the city, after the city's request for defense and indemnification has been made pursuant to the indemnification clauses contained herein, and utility's refusal is subsequently determined by a court having jurisdiction (or such other tribunal that the parties shall agree to decide the matter), to have been a wrongful refusal on the part of utility, then utility shall pay all of the city's costs and expenses for defense of the action, including reasonable attorneys' fees of recovering under this indemnification clause as well as any judgment against the city. 
(d)  In the event of liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damages to property caused by or resulting from the concurrent negligence of utility and the city, its officers, employees and agents, utility's liability hereunder shall be only to the extent of utility's comparative negligence. This waiver has been mutually negotiated by the parties. 
(e)  The city hereby releases and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the utility, its elected officials, employees, agents, and volunteers from any and all claims, costs, judgments, awards or liability to any person arising from utility's compliance with section 7-1504. 
(Ord. No. 05-5325, § 1, 5-9-05) 
Sec. 7-1509. - Insurance. 
(a)  Utility shall procure and maintain for the duration of the franchise, insurance against claims for injuries to persons or damages to property which may arise from or in connection with the exercise of the rights, privileges and authority granted hereunder to utility, its agents or employees. A combination of self-insurance and excess liability insurance may be utilized by utility. Utility shall provide to the city an insurance certificate and proof of self-insurance, if applicable, evidencing the required insurance, for city's inspection prior to the commencement of any work or installation of any facilities pursuant to this franchise, and such insurance shall evidence the following required insurance: 
(1)  Automobile Liability insurance for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with limits no less than two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) combined single limit per accident for bodily injury and property damage; and 
(2)  Commercial general liability insurance policy, written on an occurrence basis with limits no less than seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000.00) dollars per claim and one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000.00) per occurrence or five hundred thousand ($500,000) dollars combined single limit together with a one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) excess or umbrella policy. The city shall be named as a primary, additional insured. The utility's policy shall be endorsed to be primary and noncontributory. Utility shall also maintain a policy of professional liability insurance in an insurable amount not less than seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000.00) dollars per claim and one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000.00) per occurrence. Utility shall demonstrate written proof of these mandatory minimum coverages and noncontributory endorsement by providing a certificate of insurance to the city evidencing such prior to execution of this contract for personal injury, bodily injury and property damage. Coverage shall include premises, operations, independent contractors, products completed operations, personal injury and advertising injury. There shall be no endorsement or modification of the commercial general liability insurance excluding liability arising from explosion, collapse or underground property damage. Since the utility is self-insured for claims up to five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00), utility will provide security in the amount of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) in the form of a bond or other instrument acceptable to the city and such instrument will remain in continuous effect for the term of this franchise. 
(3)  Excess liability in an amount of five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) each occurrence and five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) aggregate limit. The city shall be named as an additional insured on the excess liability insurance policy. 
(b)  Payment of deductible or self-insured retention shall be the sole responsibility of utility. 
(c)  The coverage shall contain no special limitations on the scope of protection afforded to the city, its officers, officials, or employees. In addition, the insurance policy shall contain a clause stating that coverage shall apply separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought, except with respect to the limits of the insurer's liability. Utility's insurance shall be primary. Any insurance, self insurance, or insurance pool coverage maintained by the city shall be excess of utility's insurance and shall not contribute with it. Coverage shall not be suspended, voided, canceled by either party, reduced in coverage or in limits except after thirty (30) days prior written notice has been given to the city. 
(d)  Utility shall require all its subcontractors to carry insurance consistent with this section and shall provide evidence of such insurance to the city upon request. 
(Ord. No. 05-5325, § 1, 5-9-05) 
Sec. 7-1510. - Enforcement. 
(a)  In addition to all other rights and powers retained by the city under this franchise, the city reserves the right to revoke and terminate this franchise and all rights and privileges of the utility in the event of a substantial violation or breach of its terms and conditions. 
(b)  A substantial violation or breach by a utility shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  An uncured violation of any material provision of this franchise, or any material rule, order or regulation of the city made pursuant to its power to protect the public health, safety and welfare; 
(2)  An intentional evasion or knowing attempt to evade any material provision of this franchise or practice of any fraud or deceit upon the system customers or upon the city; 
(3)  Failure to provide the services specified in the franchise; 
(4)  Misrepresentation of material fact during negotiations relating to this franchise or the implementation thereof; 
(5)  A continuous and willful pattern of grossly inadequate service; 
(6)  An uncured failure to pay fees associated with this franchise; 
(c)  No violation or breach shall occur which is without fault of the utility or the city, or which is as a result of circumstances beyond the utility's or the city's reasonable control. Neither the utility, nor the city, shall be excused by economic hardship nor by nonfeasance or malfeasance of its directors, officers, agents or employees; provided, however, that damage to equipment causing service interruption shall be deemed to be the result of circumstances beyond a utility's or the city's control if it is caused by any negligent act or unintended omission of its employees (assuming proper training) or agents (assuming reasonable diligence in their selection), or sabotage or vandalism or malicious mischief by its employees or agents. A utility, or the city, shall bear the burden of proof in establishing the existence of such conditions. 
(d)  Except in the case of termination pursuant to subsection (b)(4), prior to any termination or revocation, the city, or the utility, shall provide the other with detailed written notice of any substantial violation or material breach upon which it proposes to take action. The party who is allegedly in breach shall have a period of sixty (60) days following such written notice to cure the alleged violation or breach, demonstrate to the other's satisfaction that a violation or breach does not exist, or submit a plan satisfactory to the other to correct the violation or breach. If, at the end of said 60-day period, the city or the utility reasonably believes that a substantial violation or material breach is continuing and the party in breach is not taking satisfactory corrective action, the other may declare that the party in breach is in default, which declaration must be in writing. Within twenty (20) days after receipt of a written declaration of default, the party that is alleged to be in default may request, in writing, a hearing before a "hearing examiner" as provided by the city's development regulations. The hearing examiner's decision may be appealed to any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(e)  The city may, in its discretion, provide an additional opportunity for the utility to remedy any violation or breach and come into compliance with this agreement so as to avoid the termination or revocation. 
(f)  Any violation existing for a period greater then thirty (30) days may be remedied by the city at the utility's expense.

A transfer shall be deemed to have occurred whenever there is a change, acquisition or conveyance of control of a general partner, or of more than a twenty (20) percent ownership in a grantee or its direct or indirect parents by any entity, or a group of entities acting in concert. However, a transfer also occurs whenever there is a change in actual working control, in whatever manner exercised, over the affairs of a grantee or its direct or indirect parents; or 
(3)  The rights and/or obligations held by a grantee under a cable franchise are transferred, sold, assigned, or leased, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, to another party.

    Except as provided by applicable law, it is unlawful for a person, other than city, to construct or operate a cable system without a valid cable franchise. 
(Ord. No. 08-5471, § 1, 6-9-08) 
Sec. 7-1604. - Grant of cable franchise. 
    The city may grant one or more cable franchises in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the City Charter and this Code. Nothing contained in this Code is, nor should it be construed to be, a contract between the city and a grantee. Nothing contained in this Code, or in a franchise issued pursuant to this Code, prohibits, or should be construed to prohibit the city from amending and applying this Code to a grantee. Terms of a franchise shall be read consistent with the Code, and shall not be deemed to supersede or waive any provisions of the Code except as specifically stated therein. Any action on a franchise application, whether for a initial franchise, renewal franchise, or transfer shall be taken in accordance with time limits established by federal or state law. The city is not required to follow any procedure that would result in the city failing to meet any such time limits.

Sec. 7-1605. - Transfers of cable franchises. 
(a)  Transfers shall not occur without the city's prior written approval, except where a request for approval or sale is subject to a deadline for action under 47 U.S.C. § 537, and the city fails to act by the time required under 47 U.S.C. § 537. The city, among other remedies, may terminate the franchise if it is transferred without the city's approval. The granting of approval for a transfer in one instance shall not render unnecessary the city's approval of any subsequent transfer. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city's prior approval is not required for the following: Pledges in trust or mortgages of the assets of, or a grant of a similar security interest in, a cable system or cable franchise to secure the construction, operation or repair of the cable system; provided that: 
(1)  Arrangements are not made that would prevent a grantee or any successor from complying with the cable franchise and applicable law; 
(2)  Arrangements do not permit a third party to succeed to the interest of a grantee, or to own or control the cable system, without the city's prior consent; 
(3)  Any such mortgage, pledge, or security interest will be subject and subordinate to the rights of the city under the cable franchise and/or applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 08-5471, § 1, 6-9-08) 
Sec. 7-1606. - Cable franchise characteristics. 
(a)  A cable franchise is non-exclusive and does not explicitly or implicitly preclude the city from granting other cable franchises or affect the city's right to construct, operate, or maintain its own cable system. The city may refuse to issue a cable franchise to a grantee that will result in any person obtaining an exclusive right to serve any portion of the city. 
(b)  All privileges prescribed by a cable franchise are subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of public way. The city has the right to designate where a grantee's facilities may be placed within public way. 
(c)  A cable franchise is a privilege held in public trust by the grantee. 
(d)  A grantee shall not require a subscriber or a building owner or manager to enter into an exclusive contract as a condition of providing or continuing cable service. However, nothing prevents a grantee from entering into an otherwise lawful exclusive consensual arrangement with a building owner or manager of a multiple dwelling unit or commercial subscriber. 
(e)  Nothing in any cable franchise shall be read to waive any of the city's governmental rights or police powers. 
(Ord. No. 08-5471, § 1, 6-9-08) 
Sec. 7-1607. - Rate regulation. 
    The city may regulate rates and charges of each grantee, and order refunds of unreasonable rates charged, except to the extent that it is preempted from doing so by applicable law. The city shall follow any applicable state or federal procedures for reviewing rates. 
(Ord. No. 08-5471, § 1, 6-9-08) 
Sec. 7-1608. - No recourse against city. 
    Every cable franchise franchised pursuant to the provisions of this Code shall provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by state law, without limiting such immunities as the city or other persons may have under applicable law, a grantee shall not have any monetary recourse against the city or its officials, boards, commissions, public agencies when acting on the city's behalf, or employees for any loss, costs, expense, or damage arising out of the construction, operation or repair of its cable system, or the activities of the city or any entity authorized by the city to use public way or other public property unless the same was caused by the city's criminal acts or gross negligence. Nothing in this section waives claims a grantee might otherwise have against third parties. 
(Ord. No. 08-5471, § 1, 6-9-08) 
Sec. 7-1609. - Acts at grantee's expense. 
    Any act that a cable franchise or this article requires or allows a grantee to perform, shall be performed at the grantee's expense, unless expressly provided for otherwise in the cable franchise, this article, or state law.

The city may submit invoices to an applicant from time to time to recover its expenses, which invoices shall be paid within thirty (30) days of rendering. Any amounts paid by an applicant, but not actually expended by the city, shall be returned to the applicant. Nothing herein prevents an applicant from claiming that a particular application fee, as applied, violates 47 U.S.C. § 542. 
(Ord. No. 08-5471, § 1, 6-9-08) 
Sec. 7-1612. - Applications for initial or renewal franchise.

(3)  The applicant shall not have had an application to the city for an initial or renewal cable franchise denied on the ground that the applicant failed to propose a cable system meeting the cable-related needs and interests of the community. If grantee challenges a denial, it may not apply while the appeal is pending, or for three (3) years after the final resolution of the appeal if the denial is valid. 
(4)  The applicant shall not be issued a cable franchise if, at any time during the ten (10) years preceding the submission of the application, the applicant was convicted of fraud, racketeering, anti-competitive actions, unfair trade practices or other conduct of such character that the applicant cannot be relied upon to deal truthfully with the city and the subscribers, or to substantially comply with its obligations.

(9)  Whether approving the application would eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service. 
(Ord. No. 08-5471, § 1, 6-9-08) 
Sec. 7-1618. - Standards for review of transfer applications. 
(a)  In determining whether to grant, deny, or grant subject to conditions an application for a transfer of a cable franchise, the city may consider: 
(1)  The legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the applicant to operate the cable system, or in the case of a change in control where the grantee will not change, whether the change in control may adversely affect the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the grantee; 
(2)  The impact of the transfer on subscriber rates or services; 
(3)  Whether the incumbent grantee is in compliance with its cable franchise and applicable law and, if not, the applicant's commitment to cure such noncompliance; 
(4)  Whether the applicant owns or controls any other cable system in the city, and whether operation by the applicant may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the city; 
(5)  Whether the city and subscribers are protected against losses and costs associated with acts and omissions, or obtaining correction of acts and omissions, of the previous grantee under the cable franchise and applicable law; and 
(6)  Whether operation by the applicant or approval of the transfer would adversely affect subscribers, the public, or the city's interest under the cable franchise, or applicable law. 
(b)  In reviewing a change of control where the named grantee does not change, the applicant is the company succeeding to the control of the grantee. 
(c)  Requests for approval of a transfer shall not be unreasonably denied, or conditioned. 
(Ord. No. 08-5471, § 1, 6-9-08)

(a)  Before deciding whether to grant a cable franchise, the city shall hold one or more public hearings or implement other procedures for obtaining public input.

(c)  If the city finds that it is in the public interest to approve a transfer, considering the factors described above, the city shall approve the same, subject to appropriate conditions. 
(d)  It is the policy of the city to promote competition in the provision of cable services, but there is a presumption that a cable franchise, or franchise or franchise to use the public rights-of-way to deliver multichannel video programming services, that would result in redlining on economic or racial grounds, or otherwise give the applicant an unfair competitive advantage shall not be franchised. 
(e)  It is the policy of the city that each franchise agreement shall require a grantee to extend service upon request to any entity requesting service within its service area, in accordance with the provisions of this article or service extension policies set forth in the cable franchise. 
(f)  If the city denies a cable franchise, it shall issue a written decision explaining its denial.

The base of the upright monument or the flat grave marker shall be wet set into the concrete foundation. 
(d)  In the cremation section only flat markers shall be used. In a single cremation grave the stone itself can only measure eight (8) inches by sixteen (16) inches. Double cremation graves may have a twelve-inch (12) by twenty-four inch (24) stone centered on the graves. The foundations for the markers shall be twelve (12) inches deep and surround the stone so that the stone has an eight-inch (8) border on three sides and a thirteen-inch (13) border on the side where the flower container is placed. 
(e)  In the baby sections only flat markers shall be used. Because all of the graves are single gravesites and the graves smaller than the traditional grave, the largest flat stone that can be used in the baby section is ten (10) inches by twenty (20) inches or smaller. At no time can the foundation of the stone run over the grave boundary to its neighboring gravesite. 
(f)  Mausoleums and vaults above ground may be erected only with the consent of the city after all plans and materials have been approved by the city. 
(g)  All work must be under the inspection of the city and completed as rapidly as possible. Materials not used must be removed as the work is completed. 
(h)  No materials of any kind shall be received after noon on Saturdays. 
(i)  Any person desiring to set a monument or marker or build a foundation for that purpose or modify an existing stone, must, before commencing such work, obtain from the cemetery office a permit authorizing such construction. The cemetery office shall not issue a permit required by this division until the applicant has obtained a business license and furnish to the city a surety bond in the amount of $10,000.00 dollars, which shall be held by the city as a guarantee that the work will be done in a satisfactory manner. The bond shall provide that the applicant will in good faith perform all that the city requires. Continuation certificates to renew the surety bond will not be accepted. Such bond shall be filed with the city clerk. The city shall determine whether or not a monument or foundation has been satisfactorily constructed and set. 
(j)  Any person desiring to set a monument or marker or build a foundation for that purpose, shall have all the necessary tools and equipment that are recognized by the monument setting industry. 
(k)  In setting a monument or marker or building a foundation, the contractor shall be liable for any damage to other people's property or to general appearance of the cemetery. The contractor shall be responsible for leaving the cemetery in the same general condition as it was before setting the stone. 
(l)  Nothing herein shall be construed in any manner to limit the liability of any person engaged in the business of setting monuments or markers, or building foundations for them, for damages in excess of the amount required by the surety bond, nor shall the surety bond be construed to limit the right of any individual who has been damaged by any setting of a monument or marker of building a foundation from bringing an action without regard to the conditions of this provision. 
(m)  Monuments and markers are personal property and therefore the responsibility of the grave owner. It is the responsibility of the grave owner to notify the cemetery of any change in mailing address or ownership of the grave so that the cemetery can contact them. Notice sent to an owner at the last address on file in the cemetery office shall be considered sufficient and proper legal notification. The monument permit must have the name and address of the person ordering the stone. 
(n)  In the event that the owners of a monument cannot be contacted, the city or their agents may modify monuments within the cemetery that present a public safety hazard or detract from the overall appearance of the cemetery. 
(o)  The city or their agents shall not be held liable if a monument in danger of falling is damaged in the process of modifying the stone to correct the safety hazard.

Sec. 13-505. - Debarment of contractors. 
(a)  If a person commits an act, as defined in this section, indicating that the person no longer merits the privilege of contracting with the city or participating in city projects, the city may begin proceedings under these rules to debar the person from bidding on or otherwise participating in city contracts or projects. The city will debar or suspend contractors which violate this section, and will not do business with, or allow prime and subcontractors to do business with, on city-related projects, persons debarred or suspended by the federal government, by another state, or by an agency of state government. A contractor who has been debarred by the city, the federal government, by another state, or by an agency of state government may not participate in work, contracts or projects with the city. A person's decision to bid upon or accept contracts with the city, or otherwise participate in city contracts, is a voluntary acceptance of the provisions of these rules and their requirements. 
(b)  The city administrator has the authority to temporarily suspend a contractor from consideration for further contracts with the city if the city administrator has credible evidence to believe that the contractor has engaged in activities that could lead to debarment from contract eligibility. Debarment applies both to a firm or an individual. In the case of a firm, it may be applied against any or all businesses in which a firm has involvement or over which it has ownership or control. In the case of an individual, debarment may be applied to and enforced against any and all businesses in which the individual has any level of interest, ownership or control. The causes for debarment include the following: 
(1)  Submission of a false affidavit for state residency; 
(2)  Deliberate failure, without good cause, to perform in accordance with the specifications or within the time limit provided in a contract; 
(3)  Contractor does not have a satisfactory record of integrity; 
(4)  Contractor is not qualified legally to contract with the city; 
(5)  Contractor has failed to supply any necessary information in connection with the inquiry concerning the responsibility; 
(6)  A recent record of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance in accordance with the terms of one or more contracts; 
(7)  Failure to comply with the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Law, MCA Title 39, chapter 51; 
(8)  Failure to comply with the provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act, MCA Title 39, chapter 71; 
(9)  Failure to pay the prevailing wage to any worker on any contract costing more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) let for construction, heavy construction, highway construction or remodeling work; or 
(10)  Any other cause that the city administrator determines to be so serious and compelling as to affect responsibility as a city contractor, including debarment by another governmental entity. 
(c)  If there is credible evidence that any of the situations exist as set out in subsection (b), the city administrator shall mail a notice of suspension to the affected contractor or individual. The notice must state that: 
(1)  The suspension is for the period it takes to complete an investigation into possible debarment; 
(2)  Bids or proposals will not be accepted from the suspended contractor and contracts will not be awarded to the suspended contractor during the period of suspension; 
(3)  The suspension is effective upon the date of issuance of the notice of suspension and, unless the suspension is terminated by the city administrator or a court, it will remain in effect for a period not to exceed ninety (90) calendar days. 
(d)  If the city administrator's investigation confirms a cause for debarment, a notice will be served upon the contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice will include: 
(1)  The pertinent facts supporting the alleged cause for debarment and the city administrator's intent to remove the contractor from eligibility to contract with the city; 
(2)  The term of the debarment and to what extent affiliates are affected. The debarment will be for a specific period of time or until certain conditions are met, at the discretion of the city administrator; and 
(3)  Notification of the contractor's right to a hearing on the matter with the city administrator, or designee, as hearing examiner, and of the contractor's right to appeal any adverse determination by the hearing examiner to the full city council. 
(e)  A written request for hearing must be received by the city administrator from the contractor within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of the mailing of the notice of debarment. Failure to timely request a hearing will constitute a waiver by the contractor of the opportunity for a contested case hearing and appeal and will result in the city administrator or city administrator's designee entering an order supporting the contractor's debarment from contracting with the city for a specified period of time or until certain conditions are met. 
(f)  Upon timely receipt of a written request for a hearing, the city administrator shall appoint a hearing examiner to hear the evidence in the matter and come to a determination as to whether the facts support the decision to debar the contractor from contracting with the city for a specified period of time or until certain conditions are met. A written notice appointing the hearing examiner shall be issued by the city administrator, and sent to the person requesting the hearing. 
(g)  The person against whom debarment is being considered has the right to be accompanied, represented and advised by counsel, and to appear in person or by or with counsel. Counsel will not be provided by or at the expense of the city. 
(h)  Service of notice and later documents for the hearing will be complete and effective when made upon a person, or his counsel, if he has counsel. 
(i)  A notice of hearing shall be sent by the hearing examiner to the person requesting the administrative hearing. The notice shall include: 
(1)  A statement of the date, time, and location of the hearing; 
(2)  A reference to the provisions of the violation(s) involved; 
(3)  A short, understandable statement of the matters asserted; and 
(4)  A statement advising the party of its right to be represented by legal counsel at the hearing. 
(j)  The hearing examiner shall not engage in communications with any party or their counsel except upon notice and opportunity for all parties to participate. 
(k)  For hearings: 
(1)  The city shall record any hearing conducted and maintain a record of the proceedings. The record shall include: 
a.  The initial determination of the city administrator; 
b.  The written request for a hearing; 
c.  The appointment of the hearing examiner; 
d.  The notice of hearing; 
e.  The evidence offered to, or considered by, the hearing examiner; 
f.  Any objections and rulings thereon; 
g.  All matters placed on the record at the hearing; 
h.  All briefs or memoranda submitted by the parties; and 
i.  Any transcript made of the proceedings. 
(2)  The hearing examiner presiding over the hearing shall have the powers and duties to: administer oaths or affirmations; issue subpoenas; provide for the taking of testimony by deposition; regulate the course of hearings, including setting the time and place for continued hearings and fixing the time for filing of briefs or other documents; and direct parties to appear and confer to consider simplification of the issues by consent of the parties. 
(3)  Discovery will be available to the parties in accordance with Rules 26, 28 through 37 (except Rule 37(b)(1) and 37(b)(2)(d)) of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure in effect as of the date of the adoption of these rules. Provided that: all references in the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure to a "court" are considered to refer to the city; all references to the use of subpoena power are considered to refer to the power in these rules; references to "trial" are considered to refer to the hearing; all references to "plaintiff" are considered to refer to a "party"; all references to "clerk of court" are considered to refer to the hearing examiner. 
a.  If a party or other witness refuses to be sworn or refuses to answer any question after being directed to do so by the hearing examiner, the refusal to obey the hearing examiner's order shall be enforced as provided by law. 
b.  If a party seeking discovery from the city believes he has been prejudiced by a protective order issued by the hearing examiner under Rule 26(c), Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, or, if the hearing examiner refuses to make discovery, the party may petition the district court, Thirteenth Judicial District for the County of Yellowstone, for review of the intermediate action of the hearing examiner. 
(4)  The usual order of presentation at a hearing shall be: 
a.  Argument and the submission of evidence and testimony on behalf of the city; 
b.  Argument and the submission of evidence and testimony from the party requesting the hearing; and 
c.  The introduction of rebuttal evidence and testimony by the city. 
(5)  The hearing may be continued with recesses as determined by the hearing examiner. 
(6)  Evidence introduced at the hearing may be received in written form or oral testimony given under oath or affirmation. Parties have a right to cross-examine all persons testifying at a hearing. 
a.  The hearing examiner may consider hearsay evidence for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence. A decision should not ordinarily be based wholly upon hearsay evidence, however, circumstances in some cases may require it (i.e., debarment based on a prior debarment in another jurisdiction), at the discretion of the hearing examiner. 
b.  Judicially noticed facts are not hearsay. 
c.  Fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct of any individual (officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with a person) may be imputed to the person when the conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of the person, or with the person's knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. The person's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct will be evidence of such knowledge, approval or acquiescence. 
d.  The hearing examiner's experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge may be utilized in the evaluation of evidence. 
e.  Exhibits shall be marked and the markings shall identify the party offering the exhibit. Exhibits shall be preserved by the hearing examiner as part of the administrative record. 
(7)  Objections to offers of evidence must be made at the time of the offer and shall be noted in the administrative record. A hearing examiner may rule on evidentiary objections at the time of the hearing, after receipt of oral or written argument by the parties, or at the time of entry of the proposed decision. 
(8)  The person must present all potential and available grounds to contest the debarment, and failure to raise an issue before the hearing examiner will waive that issue's consideration on any appeal or potential judicial review. 
(9)  The city's burden of proof for the hearing will be a preponderance of the admissible evidence presented. That is proof by information that, compared with that opposing it, leads to the conclusion that the fact at issue is more probably true than not. 
(10)  After the hearing and any required post-hearing briefs and submissions, the hearing examiner shall enter a proposed decision, which shall be served on all parties by certified mail, return receipt requested, to their designated agent. The proposed decision shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law supported by the administrative record, and recommend a proposed action to the city administrator. 
(l)  The city administrator shall within thirty (30) days review the proposed decision and enter the hearing examiner's final decision. The city administrator may accept, reject or modify the proposed decision. The city administrator's final decision shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law, and shall be mailed to the parties by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
(m)  The sole method of appeal of the city administrator's decision is as follows: The city administrator's decision is final unless appeal is made to the commission. An appeal may only be made if it is submitted to the city administrator in writing, and only if received by the city administrator's office no later than ten (10) calendar days after date of mailing of the final decision to the designated agent of the appealing party. If delivery of the final decision is refused or for any other reason not able to be delivered to the designated agent (i.e., returned as undeliverable, addressee moved and left no forwarding address, etc.), the decision will be final and the ten-day appeal period will begin to toll on the date the certified letter is returned to the city administrator's office. 
(n)  The contractor may appeal any adverse determination by the hearing examiner to the full city council which shall review the administrative record of the proceedings and its findings and conclusions only. The council will determine whether or not the findings and conclusions are supported by that record. The council's review will not be a de novo hearing, nor will it receive written briefs from a party except on the issue of whether or not the findings and conclusions are supported by the administrative record. The council will not hear oral argument or testimony, or receive any evidence that was not presented in the hearing. The council may affirm, reject or modify the city administrator's decision. If the council determines that the record does not support the findings and conclusions, it may refer the matter back to the city administrator for any action the council deems appropriate and directs. 
    The council's determination shall be final. 
(o)  Debarment is distinct from a finding of nonresponsibility. The city has the authority and ability in its discretion to find a person nonresponsible for purposes of disallowing a bid on a project or contract, or prohibiting a person from otherwise participating in a project or contract (e.g., as a subcontractor, supplier, etc.) without conducting debarment proceedings. 
(p)  If debarred by the federal government or any state government agency, a person may not bid on or otherwise participate in any city project or contract in any capacity (prime contractor, subcontractor, supplier, etc.), including as a separate contractor for a utility to relocate utilities required by a city project, until after the completion of the entire debarment period, whether or not the city debars the person. Debarment proceedings may proceed even if the person ceases doing business during the proceedings. 
(q)  If a person is debarred by any agency of the federal government for any period, the city may debar it for a period up to that set by the federal government without need for further debarment proceedings. The only evidence required in a debarment hearing in a case based on an existing debarment will be a certified copy of an order, agency letter or other final action declaring the debarment in the other jurisdiction. That will not prevent the person from presenting evidence to dispute the proposed debarment or its length. If the person is debarred by a branch or agency other than of the state or federal government (i.e., another state, a county, etc.), or if the city may wish a debarment period exceeding that set by the other state agency or the federal government, the city must hold debarment proceedings before increasing the debarment period. 
(r)  A person planning to bid on or participate in a city contract or work, or who has already bid on or is participating in a city contract or work, must immediately notify the city administrator in writing of any debarment or suspension against it, or of any debarment or suspension proceedings pending against it in any jurisdiction. 
(s)  Projects or contracts already awarded to a person at the time it is debarred will not be affected, except that a bid may be rejected, or contract award rescinded, if a person submits the bid or is awarded the contract after the date on which it was debarred. 
(t)  The city shall maintain a list of debarred contractors on its website at http://ci.billings.mt.us/.

ARTICLE 13-800. - SPECIAL IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT SURCHARGE 

Sec. 13-801. - Preamble. 
    The city over the past decade has experienced exceptional growth. The growth has caused tracts of land to be developed and greater growth potential exists presently. The developments have been aided and will continue to be aided by special improvement district financing. Because of the rapid growth and development there have not always been timely payments of the assessments and the revolving fund has been overburdened. The burden must be alleviated by the imposition of a five (5) percent surcharge on each special improvement district. The state laws provides that the five (5) percent surcharge may be assessed against the district. 
(Code 1967, § 3.50.010) 
Sec. 13-802. - Purpose. 
    The quality and salability of special improvement district bonds by the city is directly related to the security of the bond buyer and the ability of the city to pay the assessments as they come due. The special improvement district bonds are of special aid and assistance to developers and persons residing within the special improvement districts. 
(Code 1967, § 3.50.020) 
Sec. 13-803. - Definitions. 
    The following words and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them: 
    Developed means a legally defined parcel of land on which a structure is built. 
    Developer means the person changing the raw land from its natural state into urban subdivisions. 
    Raw land means land within the special improvement district which is not developed to the extent of twenty-five (25) percent or more. In determining the percentage developed, the total developed area less streets, alleys and public lands shall be divided by the total area within the special improvement district. 
(Code 1967, §§ 3.50.025, 3.50.030) 
Cross reference- Definitions and rules of construction generally, § 1-102. 
Sec. 13-804. - Surcharge. 
    There is imposed on each special improvement district created by the city a surcharge against that district equal to five (5) percent of the total cost of the district. The surcharge shall be paid into the revolving fund as additional security. In addition to the five (5) percent assessment imposed hereby, the city shall require the developer of raw land to pay an application fee and may require additional individual or corporate security or an agreement on timeliness of payment of assessments before creating the district on raw land. Special improvement districts within fully developed areas do not create the same problems because there is usually more than adequate security within those areas to pay the special improvement district bonds. The city administrator shall determine the amount and quality of any additional security required. In making that determination he or she shall consider at a minimum the following: 
(1)  Developers history on other special assessments; 
(2)  The cost of the improvements as compared to the costs of other recently completed special improvement districts; 
(3)  Current bond market; 
(4)  Status of the city's revolving fund; 
(5)  Amount and sites of similar tracts in the community that have existing improvements. 
(Code 1967, § 3.50.040) 
Sec. 13-805. - Raw land application. 
    Prior to considering a special improvement district on raw land, the developer shall execute an application under oath and pay an application fee as prescribed by council resolution. The application shall be in the form approved by the city administrator but shall contain at a minimum the status of all other special improvement districts which were initiated by, or in which the developer has an interest and a financial statement. The application fee shall be refunded upon the sale of the bonds; provided, that if the bonds are not sold within two (2) years of the date of passage of the resolution creating the special improvement district the application fee shall be forfeited to cover the costs of creation of the district. 
(Code 1967, § 3.50.050) 
Sec. 13-806. - Disposition of surcharge payments. 
    The surcharge payments from the special improvement districts, as required in this article, may be treated and considered in the same manner as any other funds authorized by the state law to be paid into the revolving fund; provided, that the city council may, at the time the special improvement district bonds are paid in full, transfer and allocate the five (5) percent surcharge from that particular special improvement district to the city general fund; and provided further, that at any time that it is determined by the city council that there are sufficient reserve funds in the revolving fund, the city council may transfer and allocate a portion of the total funds in the revolving fund over and above the necessary reserve to the city general fund. The amount so transferred and allocated to the city general fund may be budgeted and expended pursuant to the normal budgetary process.

ARTICLE 13-900. - SPECIAL SERVICE DISTRICTS 

Sec. 13-901. - Purpose.

The city may perform the work by its own forces or contract for the work to be done.

Sec. 13-906. - Grant of easement. 
    Prior to creation of the district the property owners shall grant all necessary public access easements to enable the city to make necessary maintenance, repairs and related work to all service lines or other structures. If the necessary easements cannot be provided, the city may through its power of eminent domain condemn necessary easements and assess the costs and expenses of obtaining the easements against the district. The costs and expenses of obtaining the easements shall include all direct, indirect, administrative costs and incidental costs of the process for obtaining the easements.

Sec. 13-909. - Creation of district. 
(a)  Following the public hearing, the city council shall consider the creation of the special service district. The council may adjust the boundaries of the proposed district and the properties included therein provided that the adjustments do not increase the burden of the properties or include additional properties. 
(b)  If the council desires to create the district, it shall pass a resolution creating the special service district and shall cause it to be assigned a number. The resolution shall as a minimum describe the district, impose the initial assessment and provide for periodic assessments as needed to fund the revolving fund at a level deemed necessary to meet all future estimates of maintenance, repairs and related work. If it becomes necessary to change the boundaries, increase the area, combine districts or dissolve a district the city council shall follow the procedure for creation; provided that one hundred (100) percent of owners may waive right to notice and the city council may take action by resolution without further notice or delay. 
(Ord. No. 4442, § 1(3.60.080), 5-17-82) 
Sec. 13-910. - Assessments. 
(a)  The initial and periodic assessments shall be billed directly to the property owners and shall be apportioned by dividing the total assessment by the number of private lines feeding the service lines. 
(b)  Such billings shall be made not later than July first of the year in which the assessment is made. If any initial assessment or subsequent assessment is not paid on or before August first, the same shall become a lien on the real property against which the assessment is made.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 99-5090, adopted July, 12, 1999, amended the Code by adding provisions designated as sections 13-1100-13-1108. The provisions of said ordinance have been renumbered by the editor as herein set out in order to conform to the format of the Code. 
Cross reference- Special improvement district revolving fund, § 13-206. 

Sec. 13-1101. - Recitals. 
(a)  The city by Resolution No. 12303, adopted December 20, 1976, adopted the Billings, Montana, Downtown Redevelopment District Plan (the "plan") as an urban renewal plan for the Downtown Redevelopment District (the "district") and elected to exercise its urban renewal powers ("urban renewal powers") pursuant to Montana Code Annotated, Title 7, Chapter 15, Parts 42 and 43, as amended (the "Act"). Pursuant to the Act and the procedures contained in the plan, as amended by Ordinance No. 84-4598, the city has established a procedure for approving urban renewal projects from time to time. 
(b)  The plan contained a provision for tax increment financing. In 1983, the city implemented its tax increment revolving loan program (the "program"), pursuant to which the city has used approximately six hundred thousand dollars ($600,000) of tax increment moneys to make loans for eligible projects under the program. Principal of and interest received on the program loans were deposited in to the revolving loan fund (the "fund") as received. Since 1988, no additional tax increment moneys have been deposited in the fund and the city does not plan to or anticipate appropriating any additional tax increment revenues to the fund. As of January 1, 1999, there was approximately eight hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($825,000) of cash in the fund available for loans. The fund has approximately eight hundred forty thousand dollars ($840,000) in principal amount of loans outstanding. As of this date, the assets of the program are approximately one million six hundred fifty-eight thousand five hundred seventeen dollars ($1,658,517). 
(c)  Under the Act, as existing, the city's ability to use tax increment financing will terminate on the date that the last principal of and interest on the city's urban renewal tax increment bonds outstanding on the date hereof are paid, which is scheduled to be March 1, 2008. Under the Act, the city is authorized to exercise urban renewal powers without the adoption of tax increment financing or beyond the expiration of tax increment financing. 
(d)  The City of Billings, Yellowstone County, School District #2, Downtown Billings Association and the Big Sky Economic Development Authority along with the business community and interested citizens have participated in the development of the Downtown Billings Framework Plan adopted in December 1997, which among other things identifies weaknesses of downtown Billings which includes the district as well as strategies, goals and objectives for strengthening and revitalizing the downtown area. 
(e)  Pursuant to Resolution No. 98-17412, adopted on September 28, 1998, the city council approved the Downtown Billings Improvement Plan as an urban renewal project. 
(f)  The city has entered into an agreement with the Downtown Billings Partnership Inc.

Sec. 17-101. - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section: 
    Ambient noise is the noise which exists at a point of measurement in the absence of the sound emitted by the source being measured, being the total effect of all other sounds coming from near and far. 
    dB(A) means sound levels in decibels measured on an "A" scale of a standard sound level meter having characteristics defined by the American National Standards Institute, Publication S.4-1970. 
    Decibel. Sound pressure level in decibels is a logarithmic unit used to express the magnitude of sound pressure with respect to a reference sound pressure. It is defined as twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base ten (10) of the ratio of the sound pressure to the reference sound pressure. By international standards, the reference sound pressure is 2 × 10 5 newtons/meter squared. By example, a doubling of sound pressure, at any magnitude, will result in a six (6) decibel increase in sound pressure level; a ten-fold increase will result in a 20-decibel increase in sound pressure level. 
    Emergency work is unanticipated work, maintenance, or construction required to restore property to a safe condition following a public calamity, meteorological event, accident, or any other event which interrupts essential services or utilities, endangers persons or property, or adversely affects infrastructure.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 19-5721, § 4, adopted Jan. 14, 2019, amended the title of § 18-304 to read as herein set out. The former § 18-304 title pertained to enforcement. 
Sec. 18-305. - Abatement and collection of costs. 
    The remedies specified in this section shall be in addition to all other remedies provided by law. When a public nuisance has not been abated by the responsible party within the time specified in the notice of violation and after a first municipal infraction citation has been issued, the following procedure applies: 
(1)  The city may bring a civil action in the municipal court to have the nuisance declared as such by the court and for an order enjoining the public nuisance or authorizing its restraint, removal, termination or abatement. 
(2)  The action to declare and abate a public nuisance shall be brought by the city in the name of the people of the city, by the filing of a complaint, which shall be verified or supported by an affidavit. Summons shall be issued and served as provided by state law for civil cases. If the owner or responsible person cannot be personally served after good faith efforts, service may be made by publication as provided in state law for matters concerning real property. 
(3)  The respondent shall file a response as provided by state law for civil cases and as set forth in sections 18-1302 and 18-1303. Within thirty (30) days of the response being filed, the court shall set the matter for scheduling conference and/or trial. Failure to appear on any other date set for trial shall be grounds for entering a default and judgment thereon against a non-appearing party. 
(4)  If the respondent has filed no response as required in section 18-305(3) and the city proves that proper service was made on the respondent, the court may enter judgment against the respondent as provided by state law for civil cases and as set forth in section 18-1303. For good cause shown, and prior to enforcement, the court may set aside an entry of default and the judgment entered thereon. 
(5)  The judgment of the municipal court may be appealed to the district court. 
(6)  The procedure for determining the cost of abatement of a public nuisance will be as follows: 
a.  The enforcement officer will secure a good faith estimate of the costs to abate the public nuisance prior to or coincidentally with the civil action filed in municipal court. The enforcement officer may utilize city resources, including staff and equipment, to complete some or all components of a court ordered abatement, and the value of utilization of staff and equipment shall be assessed in accordance with this section. 
b.  The enforcement officer will forward the good faith estimate of the costs to abate the public nuisance to the municipal court and the city's legal staff. 
c.  The municipal court may assess as a judgment the good faith estimate of the costs of abatement. 
d.  The municipal court may allow the property owner a period of time, not to exceed forty-five (45) days, to abate the public nuisance prior to assessing the good faith estimate in a judgement. 
e.  At the expiration of the period of time allowed by the municipal court, the city may proceed to enter the property and abate the nuisance as ordered and in accordance with the good faith estimate. 
f.  The enforcement officer will coordinate the abatement project and oversee the work as it is being performed. 
g.  After the planning director and the enforcement officer have approved the final bill it will be forwarded to the city finance department for payment by the property owner. 
h.  A copy of approved bill(s) and proof of disbursement is placed in the enforcement agency file maintained by enforcement officer. These documents, along with the itemized abatement expense report are used to determine the total cost of abatement for the property. The abatement expense report is then certified and transmitted to the finance department for approval of assessment on the real property being abated. 
i.  The property owner will then be sent an abatement expense report for the subject property and be given notice that any assessment that is not paid shall become a lien upon the property and is enforceable in the same manner as the nonpayment of property taxes. The interest fee will be waived for any payments made within thirty (30) days of notice. 
j.  A summary listing of the assessments, tax codes, and property owners will be kept by the clerk and recorder through August 31 of each year, and the list shall be presented to the department of revenue for billing on the next real property tax statement. 
k.  A special abatement fund will be established to account for costs, collections, and transactions necessary to the efficient operation of the program. Assessment funds collected are returned to the designated abatement account for future use on other involuntary property abatements or for transfer back to the city general fund. 
l.  Any judgment assessed by the municipal court may not exceed the statutory amount as set in MCA 3-11-103, as amended. The portion of a good faith estimate that exceeds this statutory amount may not be assessed as a judgment by the municipal court.

    A person commits a violation if he loiters or prowls in a place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the actor takes flight upon appearance of a peace officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the actor or other circumstance makes it impracticable, a peace officer shall prior to any arrest for an offense under this section afford the actor an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by requesting him to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the peace officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the actor was true and, if believed by the peace officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm. A violation of this section is a misdemeanor with the penalties set forth in section 1-110.

ARTICLE 18-1100. - GRAFFITI 

Sec. 18-1101. - Purpose and intent. 
    The city council is enacting this article to help prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and private property. The council is authorized to enact this article pursuant to its police powers, as specified in Section 1.01 of the City Charter and MCA §§ 7-1-101, 7-5-4101, and 7-5-4104 that authorize the city to have all power possible for a self-government city as fully and as completely as though they were fully enumerated in the Charter, to exercise any power not prohibited by the Constitution or laws of the state, to make and pass all laws not repugnant to the Constitution or laws of the state necessary for the government or management of the affairs of a city or town, and to define and abate nuisances and impose fines on persons guilty of creating, continuing or suffering nuisances to exist on premises they occupy or control. 
    The council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless the city acts to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city. 
    The city council intends, through the adoption of this article, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement. The council does not intend for this article to conflict with any existing anti-graffiti state laws.

Cross reference- Alcoholic beverages, ch. 3. 

Sec. 18-1201. - Purpose, findings. 
    Whereas consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors and parties where minors consume alcoholic beverages present numerous problems for our community, minors and law enforcement. Specifically: 
 Montana teens report one of the highest binge drinking rates in the nation (defined as five (5) or more drinks in one (1) sitting). 
 Eighty-four (84) percent of underage drinkers were in their own home or in someone else's home when they had their last drink. 
 In Yellowstone County in 2008: One out of ten (10.6%) of eighth graders, almost one out of four (23.5%) tenth graders, and more than one-third (36.3%) of twelfth graders reported binge drinking in the two (2) weeks prior to being surveyed. 
    Whereas alcohol abuse is also linked to several other health and life issues for our youth including but certainly not limited to sexual assault, unprotected sexual activity, teenage pregnancy, STDs, physical assault and academic difficulties; 
    Whereas, the city council finds and declares that the purpose of this article is: 
(1)  To protect public health, safety and general welfare; 
(2)  To enforce laws prohibiting the consumption of alcohol by minors; 
(3)  To reduce the costs of providing police services to parties, gatherings, or events that require a response by requiring social hosts to ensure minors are not consuming alcoholic beverages; 
    Whereas under MCA 7-1-4123, legislative powers, the city has the legislative power, subject to the provisions of state law, to adopt, amend, and repeal ordinances and resolutions required to: 
(1)  Preserve peace and order and secure freedom from dangerous of noxious activities; 
(2)  Secure and promote the general public health and welfare; and 
    Whereas MCA 7-32-4302 allows the city to both control disturbances of the peace as well as prevent intoxication and disorderly conduct within the city and within three (3) miles of the limits. 
    Now therefore be it resolved by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 09-5491, § 1, 4-27-09)

    Animal as a class of refuse, dead animals means those that die naturally or from disease, are accidently killed, or disposed of administratively. Animals or parts of animals from slaughter houses or similar places are not included in this term, but are regarded as industrial refuse. 
    Cinders and ashes means the residue from the burning of wood, coal, coke, or other combustible materials in homes, stores, institutions and small industrial establishments, for the purpose of heating, cooking and disposing of waste combustible materials. Cinders produced in steam generating plants are included within the meaning of this term. 
    Commercial means all business, industrial, institutional or agricultural establishments and all other properties that do not meet the residential definition. The city may allow multi-plex units to be classified as commercial at the owner's request. 
    Garbage includes animal and vegetable waste resulting from the handling, preparation, cooking and consumption of foods. It is composed largely of organic matters and their natural moisture content. The term includes within its meaning, food processing wastes from canneries, slaughter houses, packing plants or similar industries, or large quantities of condemned food products. Garbage also originates in kitchens, wholesale and retail stores and markets, restaurants, hotels and other places where food is stored, prepared, cooked or consumed. 
    Refuse means all solid waste of any kind or type legally disposed of through the operations of the city.

It comprises, among a great variety of other rejected matter, excavated earth, stones, bricks, plaster, wallpaper, lumber, shingles, concrete and waste parts.

(3)  Noncombustible rubbish comprises miscellaneous refuse materials that are nonflammable at ordinary temperatures. For the most part, it is the inorganic component of rubbish, such as tin cans, metals, mineral matter, glass, crockery, dust, metal furniture, etc. 
(4)  Yard rubbish consists of tree branches, twigs, grass and shrub clippings, cut weeds, fallen leaves and general yard and garden waste materials. 
    Service means the frequency of collection each week and the size of containers used.

All plats shall be twenty-four (24) inch by thirty-six (36) inch size and/or eleven (11) inch by seventeen (17) inch size as specified by the planning director or designee. One (1) electronic copy of the plat shall be provided in either AutoCad (r) or ArcGIS (r) format and one (1) copy shall be provided in .pdf, .jpg or .tif format. 
(6)  Supporting documentation. 
a.  Required documents. The supporting information shall include those documents listed in appendix F "required supporting documents for major preliminary plat applications." 
b.  Required copies. The subdivider shall provide the number of copies of the supporting documents as determined by the planning director or designee. All documents shall be typed and in a format specified by the planning director or designee. 
(7)  Staff and agency review. 
a.  Review procedure schedule. Upon receipt of a complete and sufficient major preliminary plat application, the planning director or designee shall develop a schedule for the review period. The schedule shall include the dates, times and location of all key meetings, hearings and actions, and the dates of all key deadlines. 
b.  Submittal distribution. Planning staff shall distribute the application to all affected city departments, local, state, and federal agencies, school districts and public utilities for review, and include a copy of the review procedure schedule. These affected entities shall determine what effect the proposed subdivision may have on their ability to provide services and submit recommendations for mitigation of those impacts. The affected entities shall respond to the planning staff within approximately ten (10) working days. A public utility or agency review may not delay the governing body's action on the plan beyond the sixty (60) or eighty (80) working day review period. Failure of any agency to complete a review of a plat will not be the basis for denial of the plat by the governing body (MCA 76-3-504(1)(i)). 
c.  Department plat review meeting. Planning staff shall arrange a department plat review meeting to publicly review comments from the affected entities and inform the subdivider of revisions or additions required to bring the application into compliance with local regulations and state law. The subdivider and their representative are required to attend the department plat review meeting and shall be given a copy of all comments received to date from the affected entities. 
d.  Application resubmittal. The planning staff shall notify the subdivider, in writing, of the resubmittal requirements within one (1) working day of the department plat review meeting. The subdivider shall revise the plat and supporting documents as required and submit the number of copies of the revised application and documents as determined by the planning director or designee within five (5) working days of receipt of the resubmittal notice. 
e.  Final staff comments. Affected departments shall provide the planning staff with final written comments regarding the resubmitted documents within five (5) working days of receipt of resubmittal. 
f.  Hearing notice. The planning board shall hold a public hearing on all major preliminary plat applications. Planning staff shall place a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the date of a public hearing. The planning staff shall also notify the subdivider and each property owner of record, and each purchaser under contract for deed of property immediately adjoining land included in the plat by certified mail not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the date of hearing (MCA 76-3-605(3)). 
g.  Staff report. Planning staff shall prepare staff reports and presentations for the Planning Board plat review meeting and public hearing. A copy of each staff report shall be provided to the subdivider at least five (5) working days prior to the board or governing body meeting. Each staff report shall provide a recommendation for approval, conditional approval or denial of the application and draft findings of fact as basis for the recommendation. The planning staff shall also prepare a report forwarding the recommendation of the planning board to the governing body including the board's recommendation for approval, conditional approval or denial of the applications and draft findings of fact as basis for the recommendation. 
(8)  Planning board plat review. The planning board, as the authorized agent of the governing body shall conduct a plat review of the major preliminary plat application at a regularly scheduled meeting prior to the scheduled public hearing. The purpose of the plat review meeting is to consider the following relevant review criteria: 
a.  The environmental assessment and all criteria discussed therein, unless the plat is exempted from the requirement of submitting an environmental assessment pursuant to MCA 76-3-616; and 
b.  The effect on agriculture, agricultural water user facilities, local services, the natural environment, wildlife, wildlife habitat, and public health and safety (MCA 76-3-608(3)(a)); and 
c.  Compliance with: 
1.  The Montana Subdivisions and Platting Act (MCA 76-3-101 et seq.) (MCA 76-3-608(3)(b)); and 
2.  The provision of easements for the location and installation of any planned utilities (MCA 76-3-608(3)(c)); and 
3.  The provision of legal and physical access to each parcel within the subdivision (MCA 76-3-608(3)(d)); and 
4.  The required notation of that access on the applicable plat and any instrument of transfer concerning the parcel (MCA 76-3-608(3)(d)); and 
4.  Local zoning requirements; and 
d.  Consistency with the adopted growth policy, transportation plan, and the Heritage Trail plan. [2] 
e.  Determination. The planning board shall determine if there are any significant adverse impacts the subdivision may have based on its review of this information and formulate recommended conditions to reasonably minimize those impacts. 
In reviewing a subdivision and when requiring mitigation, the planning board may not unreasonably restrict a landowner's ability to develop land, but it is recognized that in some instances the unmitigated impacts of a proposed development may be unacceptable and will preclude recommendation of approval of the plat. 
(9)  Public hearing. The planning board shall conduct the public hearing and consider all relevant evidence as related to the proposed plat before preparing its written findings of fact and recommendation to the governing body. The subdivider or their agent shall be given the opportunity to object to any testimony given. The subdivider shall be allowed to submit in writing his or her own proposed findings of fact to the board and the governing body following the hearing. 
The relevant evidence considered at the public hearing on the preliminary plat shall include the criteria listed above in subsection (8). 
After holding the public hearing and reviewing the evidence concerning the plat, the planning board shall submit its recommendations to the governing body to approve, conditionally approve or deny the major preliminary plat in writing no later than ten (10) days after the public hearing (MCA 76-3-605(4)). 
(10)  Subsequent hearing. Before acting on the subdivision application, the governing body shall determine whether public comments or documents presented at the planning board public hearing constitute: 
a.  Information that the public has not had a reasonable opportunity to examine and comment, or 
b.  New information never submitted or considered by the planning board or staff. 
If the governing body determines that public comments or documents meets at least one (1) of the criteria listed above, it may act on the subdivision application in accordance with this article or schedule a subsequent public hearing for consideration of the new information only. The subsequent public hearing shall be held by the planning board at the planning board's next scheduled meeting for which proper notice for the public hearing on the subdivision application can be provided. 
If a subsequent hearing is held, the sixty (60) or eighty (80) working day review period is suspended and the new hearing must be noticed and held within forty-five (45) days of the governing body's determination to hold a subsequent public hearing. The sixty (60) or eighty (80) working day review period will resume from the date of the subsequent public hearing. The governing body may not consider any information that is presented after the subsequent hearing (MCA 76-3-615). 
(11)  Subdivider's preference for mitigation. No later than ten (10) days before the meeting when the governing body is to consider the planning board's recommendation on the preliminary plat, the subdivider may submit in writing to the governing body comments on and responses to the planning board's recommendations. This document may include the subdivider's alternative proposals, if any, for mitigating the impacts identified in the planning board's recommendations. The governing body shall give due weight and consideration to the subdivider's expressed preferences (MCA 76-3-608(5)(b)). 
(12)  Governing body action. The governing body's decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny a subdivision is based on the preliminary plat, applicable environmental assessment, public hearing, planning board recommendations, or additional information that demonstrates the development of the subdivision meets the requirements of the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act and these regulations. A governing body may not deny approval of a subdivision based solely on the subdivision's impacts on educational services, or based solely on parcels within the subdivision having been designated as wildland-urban interface parcels under MCA 76-13-145 (MCA 76-3-608(1)), or solely on compliance with a Growth Policy (MCA 76-1-605(2)(b)). 
The governing body shall issue written findings of fact that weigh the criteria as listed in subsection (8) of this section. The governing body shall determine if there are any significant adverse impacts the subdivision may have based on its review of this information and formulate conditions to reasonably minimize those impacts (MCA 76-3-608(4)). 
In reviewing a subdivision and when requiring mitigation, the governing body may not unreasonably restrict a landowner's ability to develop land, but it is recognized that in some instances the unmitigated impacts of a proposed development may be unacceptable and will preclude approval of the plat (MCA 76-3-608(5)(a)). 
The governing body shall approve, conditionally approve or deny the preliminary plat within sixty (60) or eighty (80) working days of the submittal deadline and when the application was considered complete and sufficient. The governing body shall send the subdivider a letter within thirty (30) working days of its decision stating the reasons for the denial or enumerating the conditions which must be met to assure approval of the final plat along with written findings of fact (MCA 76-3-608(4)). 
(13)  Preliminary plat approval period. The approval or conditional approval shall be valid for not more than three (3) calendar years. At the end of this period the governing body may, at the request of the subdivider, extend its approval for a mutually agreed-upon period of time. Any mutually agreed-upon extension must be in writing and dated and signed by the governing body and the subdivider or subdivider's agent. The governing body may issue more than one (1) extension. 
When considering a request for an extension of the preliminary plat approval period, the governing body may use the following criteria to evaluate the request: 
a.  Changes to the subdivision regulations since the original approval and whether the subdivision as originally approved is essentially compliant with the new regulations; 
b.  Progress to date in completing the subdivision as a whole and any phases; 
c.  Phasing of the subdivision and the ability for the existing development to operate without the delayed development; 
d.  Dependence of infrastructure development on the subdivision; 
e.  Duration of the requested extension; 
f.  Demonstrated ability of the subdivider to complete the subdivision; 
g.  Such other factors or criteria as deemed material in the discretion of the governing body. 
After the preliminary plat is approved, the governing body may not impose any additional conditions as a prerequisite to final plat approval, providing the approval is obtained within the original or extended approval period described above (MCA 76-3-610(2)). 
(14)  Appeal process. A decision of the governing body regarding a proposed subdivision may be appealed to the district court, as provided in section 23-1105 of these regulations and MCA 76-3-625. 
(15)  Final plat. A final plat application shall be submitted for review and approval following the procedures outlined in section 23-307 of this article prior to the expiration of the preliminary plat approval period.

Note- A governing body may not withhold, deny, or impose conditions on any land use approval or other authority to act based solely on compliance with a growth policy (MCA 76-1-605(2)(b)). 

Sec. 23-303. - First minor subdivisions from a tract of record. 
    Divisions of land creating five (5) or fewer lots from a tract of record that has not been subdivided or created by a subdivision under the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act or has not resulted from a tract of record that has had more than five parcels created from that tract of record under MCA 76-3-201 or 76-3-207 since July 1, 1973 shall be reviewed as first minor subdivisions from a tract of record, hereafter referred to as a "first minor" (MCA 76-3-609). The requirement of holding a public hearing does not apply to the first minor subdivision created from a tract of record (MCA 76-3-609(2)(d)(ii)). Unless the subdivision lies within an area that has adopted zoning regulations, the application must include a summary of the probable impacts of the proposed subdivision based on the criteria described in subsection 23-303(8) of these regulations (MCA 76-3-609(2)(c)). 
    The first minor subdivision shall be reviewed by the governing body of the jurisdiction where the subdivision is located. A copy of the application shall also be provided to school district trustees (MCA 76-3-601(2)(b)). 
    If the proposed subdivision lies partly within an incorporated city or town, the proposed plat must be submitted to and approved by both the city or town and county governing body (MCA 76-3-601(2)(c)). 
    When a proposed subdivision is also proposed to be annexed to any municipality, the subdivision review and annexation procedures will be coordinated to minimize duplications of hearings, reports, and other requirements when possible (MCA 76-3-601(2)(d)). 
(1)  Preapplication meeting. The purpose of the preapplication meeting is to provide the subdivider with requirements of local subdivision regulations and the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act. A preapplication meeting must be requested no later than twenty (20) working days and no earlier than one hundred and twenty (120) working days prior to submittal of a minor preliminary plat application for completeness review. At the time of request, the subdivider shall provide the planning director or designee with ten (10) sketch plans of the proposed subdivision for review and discussion. The sketch plan should be legibly drawn to scale no greater than one (1) inch = four hundred (400) feet (1:4,800), showing in simple form the layout of proposed features in relation to existing conditions. The sketch plan may be a freehand sketch made directly on a print of a topographic map. See appendix C for recommended preapplication sketch plan contents and other meeting recommendations. 
The planning director or designee will schedule the preapplication meeting to occur within fifteen (15) working days of the receipt of the sketch plan, and shall notify the subdivider and any affected city departments of the time and place of the meeting. 
The preapplication meeting shall not constitute approval of a preliminary or final plat. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of general acceptance of the sketch plan submitted. 
(2)  Preapplication completeness review. One (1) month prior to a submittal deadline for minor preliminary plat applications, the subdivider shall submit one (1) copy of the application including the preliminary plat and supporting documents to the planning director or designee for review accompanied by the applicable fee. After receipt of the copy the planning director or designee shall notify the subdivider within five (5) working days as to the completeness of the application. A complete application will include all those items listed in appendix D "preliminary plat requirements", where applicable, and any additional information identified at the preapplication meeting. If the planning director or designee determines the application complete, the subdivider may submit the application, plat and supporting documentation for sufficiency review. If the planning director or designee determines the application is incomplete, the subdivider must correct the deficiencies and resubmit the application. 
(3)  Preapplication sufficiency review. Within fifteen (15) working days after notifying the applicant that the application is complete, the planning director or designee will determine that the information in the application is sufficient to allow for review of the proposed subdivision. If the planning director or designee determines the information is sufficient, the applicant will be notified that the complete and sufficient application may be submitted at the application submittal deadline. If the planning director or designee determines the information is insufficient, the subdivider must correct the deficiencies prior to the next submittal deadline or postpone submittal to a future submittal deadline. 
(4)  First minor preliminary plat application submittal. 
a.  Required. The subdivider shall submit to the planning director or designee, for review and recommendation, a preliminary plat of the proposed first minor subdivision which conforms to the requirements of these regulations.

These affected entities shall determine what effect the proposed subdivision may have on their ability to provide services and submit recommendations for mitigation of those impacts. The affected entities shall respond to the planning staff within approximately fifteen (15) working days. A public utility or agency review may not delay the governing body's action on the plan beyond the thirty-five (35) working day review period. Failure of any agency to complete a review of a plat will not be the basis for denial of the plat by the governing body (MCA 76-3-504(1)(i)). 
c.  Staff report. Planning staff shall prepare a staff report and presentation for the governing body. A copy of the report shall be provided to the subdivider at least five (5) working days prior to the governing body meeting.

d.  A summary of probable impacts prepared in accordance with section 23-904 of these regulations. 
e.  The governing body shall give due weight and consideration to the subdivider's expressed preferences (MCA 76-3-608(5)(b)). The governing body may not deny approval of a subdivision based solely on the subdivision's impacts on educational services, or based solely on parcels within the subdivision having been designated as wildland-urban interface parcels under MCA 76-13-145 (MCA 76-3-608(1)), or solely on compliance with the Growth Policy (MCA 76-3-605(2)(b)). 
f.  The governing body shall issue written findings of fact that weigh the criteria listed in this section. The governing body shall determine if there are any significant adverse impacts the subdivision may have based on its review of this information and formulate conditions to reasonably minimize those impacts (MCA 76-3-608(4)). 
g.  In reviewing a subdivision and when requiring mitigation, the governing body may not unreasonably restrict a landowner's ability to develop land, but it is recognized that in some instances the unmitigated impacts of a proposed development may be unacceptable and will preclude approval of the plat (MCA 76-3-608(5)(a)). 
h.  The governing body shall approve, conditionally approve or deny the preliminary plat within thirty-five (35) working days of the submittal deadline and when the application was considered complete and sufficient. The governing body shall send to the subdivider a letter within thirty (30) working days of its decision stating the reasons for the denial or enumerating the conditions which must be met to assure approval of the final plat, along with written findings of fact (MCA 76-3-608(4)). 
(9)  Preliminary plat approval period. The approval or conditional approval shall be valid for not more than three (3) calendar years. At the end of this period the governing body may, at the request of the subdivider, extend its approval for a mutually agreed-upon period of time. Any mutually agreed-upon extension must be in writing and dated and signed by the governing body and the subdivider or subdivider's agent. The governing body may issue more than one (1) extension. 
When considering a request for an extension of the preliminary plat approval period, the governing body may use the following criteria to evaluate the request:

(a)  Streets and roads, general. The arrangement, type, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to any adopted area plans including, but not limited to, the growth policy and transportation plan, and must be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, topographical conditions, public convenience and safety, and the proposed uses of the land to be served by them. 
(1)  Relation to undeveloped areas. When a proposed subdivision adjoins undeveloped land, streets within the proposed subdivision shall be arranged to allow access to the adjoining undeveloped land. Streets within the proposed subdivision shall be constructed to the boundary lines of the tract to be developed, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions. 
(2)  Relation to developed areas. The subdivider shall arrange the streets to provide for the continuation of streets between adjacent developed properties when such continuation is necessary for the convenient movement of traffic, effective provision of emergency services and efficient provision of utilities. Such provision may be waived where the adjacent land use is incompatible with the proposed subdivision, or when prevented by topography or other physical conditions. 
(3)  Separation of through and local traffic. Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed highway, arterial street or collector street, the subdivider may be required to provide frontage roads, reverse frontage lots with a no-access strip preventing access along the rear property lines, planting or fencing screens, shared accesses, or other treatment as may be necessary to adequately protect residential properties and to separate through and local traffic. 
(4)  Distance between parallel right-of-way. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad, limited access highway, canal, stream or ditch right-of-way, the subdivider may be required to provide a street or easement approximately parallel to and on each side of the right-of-way at a distance sufficient to allow for the operations and maintenance of the intervening land. Such distances shall also be determined with regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separation. 
(5)  Second access. To facilitate traffic movement, the provision of emergency services, and the placement of utilities, all major subdivisions and subsequent minor subdivisions shall provide at least two (2) means of vehicular access built to the standards of this chapter and designed to ensure public health and safety. 
Exceptions to the requirement to provide at least two (2) means of vehicular access may be made for major and subsequent minor subdivisions that meet all of the following criteria: 
 Access is provided by a cul-de-sac with an approved turnaround that is six hundred (600) feet or less in length; and 
 The subject cul-de-sac is served by a local, collector, or arterial street that is not classified as a dead end street; and 
 The subject cul-de-sac serves no more than twenty (20) lots, and no more than thirty (30) dwelling units, when residential development is proposed. 
Provision of a second means of vehicular access may be required for any subdivision when deemed necessary for public health, safety and welfare. 
When not otherwise exempt, if a second means of vehicular access built to city street standards cannot be provided for reasons of topography or other physical conditions, the subdivider shall provide an emergency access road, built to the standards detailed in section 23-413 of these regulations. 
(6)  Dead-end roads. Dead-end access roads or driveways in excess of one hundred fifty (150) feet shall not be permitted without an approved turn around at the terminus. Where streets terminate, the subdivider shall provide a "cul-de-sac" or "hammerhead-T" turnaround conforming to the design standards outlined in figure 23.406.A.1.

State Law reference- MCA 76-3-509. 

Sec. 23-701. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to promote maximum flexibility in the design of new developments within the city and to encourage innovation within a framework of timely, efficient and flexible design review. Developments that utilize innovative, progressive planning and site design techniques and methods to allow a mixture of land uses, densities, setbacks and building heights are encouraged. Cluster developments are encouraged where community resources are present and desirable for protection or preservation. Those areas include but are not limited to wildlife habitat, river and stream corridors, wetlands, historical or archeological sites or prime agricultural lands. Planned neighborhood developments are encouraged where the proposed development is in excess of twenty (20) acres and diversity in land uses is desirable. 
(Ord. No. 06-5359, § 2, 2-13-06) 
Sec. 23-702. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this article the following definitions shall apply: 
    Cluster development means a subdivision creating five (5) or more lots clustered in a group that is designed to concentrate building sites on smaller lots in order to reduce capital and maintenance costs for infrastructure through the use of concentrated public services and utilities, while allowing other lands to remain undeveloped. A minimum of thirty (30) percent of the area within the subdivision shall be reserved for open space owned by common ownership (MCA 76-3-103(2)). 
    Maximum density calculation means the maximum number of residential dwelling units allowed is calculated by dividing the gross square footage of the cluster development area (including any open space area) by the required lot area in the underlying zoning district. 
    Master plan means a site plan for a planned neighborhood development that shows lots, blocks, streets, alleys and areas for various land uses including open space within the development.

ARTICLE 23-1100. - ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS 

Sec. 23-1101. - Variances. 
    The city council may grant reasonable variances from the design and improvement standards of these regulations when strict compliance would result in undue hardship and the result would not negatively affect public health and safety. The granting of a variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations or justifying submission of an incomplete application. The city council may not approve a variance that would permit structures within the floodway of the 100-year floodplain, as defined in MCA 76-5-101. 
(1)  Requesting a variance. The subdivider shall include with the submission of the variance request, a written statement describing the facts of hardship upon which the request for the variance is based. Each requested variance shall be deemed a separate application, for which a fee shall be required. Information addressing each of the following findings shall accompany the application. The planning board shall review the submitted findings and make a recommendation to the city council. The city council shall not approve variances unless the subdivider has demonstrated that the request satisfies the following findings: 
a.  The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or general welfare or injurious to other adjoining properties; 
b.  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, an undue hardship to the owner would result if the strict letter of the regulation was enforced; 
c.  The variance will not result in an increase in taxpayer burden; 
d.  The variance will not in any manner place the subdivision in nonconformance with any adopted zoning regulations or growth policy; and 
e.  The subdivider must prove that the alternative design is equally effective and the objectives of the improvements are satisfied. 
(2)  In granting variances, the city council may require conditions of approval that will, in their judgment, secure the objectives of these regulations. 
(3)  When any such variance is granted, the motion of approval of the proposed subdivision shall contain a statement describing the variance and the facts and conditions upon which the issuance of the variance is based. 
(4)  An application for a variance is not necessary where planned neighborhood developments are proposed, as modifications to the standards and requirements of these regulations may be approved by the city council.

Minor adjustments shall not change existing conditions of approval or require additional conditions. Minor adjustments may require that a new plat be drawn; however they do not require that the plat be re-submitted for preliminary plat review. 
(b)  Major adjustments are those which, in the opinion of the city council or designee, substantially alter the basic design, or alter open space requirements of the subdivision. Changes to conditions of approval placed on the preliminary plat shall be considered major adjustments unless otherwise determined using the criteria in subsection 23-1104(c). Any changes which constitute a major adjustment shall require that a new plat be drawn and the plat be re-submitted for preliminary plat review as specified in article 23-300. 
(c)  Requested amendments to conditions.

APPENDIX A - JURISDICTIONAL MAP 

Appendix A-Planning Jurisdiction 
(Ord. No. 06-5359, § 2, 2-13-06) 
APPENDIX B - EVASION CRITERIA 
City of Billings Evasion Criteria 
A.  Purpose. 
The State of Montana provides that certain divisions of land, which would otherwise constitute subdivisions, are exempt from local subdivision review and approval, unless the development is an attempt to evade the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act (MSPA), 76-3-101, et. seq., MCA. 
The following procedures, criteria and requirements shall be used to review an exemption from subdivision review and to determine whether the division of land is for the purpose of evading the MSPA. 
B.  Procedures and General Requirements. 
1.  Any person seeking exemption from the requirements of the Subdivision and Platting Act (76-3-101 et. seq., MCA) shall submit to the Clerk and Recorder (1) a certificate of survey, exempt amended plat, or where a survey is not required an instrument of conveyance, and (2) evidence of, and a notarized statement affirming, entitlement to the claimed exemption signed by the landowner. 
2.  When a certificate of survey, exempt amended plat, or instrument of conveyance is submitted to the Planning Department, the Planning Department shall cause the documents to be examined by the designated agents of the governing body: (the City or County Public Works Department, City or County Attorney, Sanitarian, Treasurer, and Clerk and Recorder). The agents shall examine the proposed land division to determine whether it complies with the requirements set forth in this Resolution, the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act, and the Montana Sanitation in Subdivisions Act (76-4-101, et seq., MCA). 
3.  After the review to evaluate compliance with the requirements contained in this section, the agents shall submit written comments as to whether the use of the exemption is intended to evade the purposes of the Act, after which a written recommendation will be presented to the governing body for its review. 
4.  If the designated agents find that the proposed use of the exemption complies with the statutes and these criteria, they shall recommend to the Clerk and Recorder to file the certificate of survey, exempt amended plat, or record the instrument of conveyance and accompanying documents. If the agents find that the proposed use of the exemption does not comply with the statutes and these criteria, they shall advise the Clerk and Recorder of their determination and recommend whether or not to file or record the documents, and upon his/her concurrence, the Clerk shall return the materials to the landowner with an explanation as to why the recordation was declined. 
5.  Any person whose proposed use of an exemption has been denied by the designated agents may appeal the agents' decision to the governing body. The person may request a hearing, and may submit additional evidence to show that the use of the exemption in question is not intended to evade the Act. 
If the governing body concludes that the information provided by the developer overcomes the recommendation by staff that the exemption is being used to evade the Act, they may authorize the use of the exemption in writing. A certificate of survey claiming such an exemption from subdivision review, which otherwise is in proper form, may be filed (or an exempt amended plat or an instrument of conveyance recorded) if the governing body has signed a certificate of an exemption as provided in these regulations. 
6.  Landowners or their representatives are encouraged to meet with the governing body's designated agents to discuss whether a proposed land division or use of an exemption is in compliance with these criteria. 
The agents may issue an advisory opinion only, and the opinion does not constitute a commitment by the local officials when the documents creating the proposed land division are submitted to the Clerk and Recorder. 
7.  The governing body and its agents, when determining whether an exemption is claimed for the purpose of evading MSPA, shall consider all of the surrounding circumstances. These circumstances may include but are not limited to: (1) the nature of the use of the parcel, (2) the prior history of uses of the particular tract in question, (3) the proposed configuration of the tracts if the proposed exempt transaction is completed, and (4) any pattern of exempt transactions that will result in the equivalent of a subdivision without local government review (State ex rel. Dreher v. Fuller, 50 St. Rptr. 454, 1993). 
8.  Exempt divisions of land that would result in a pattern of development equivalent to a subdivision shall be presumed to be adopted for purposes of evading the Act. A "pattern of development" occurs whenever three (3) or more parcels of less than 160 acres each with common covenants or facilities pertaining to each parcel have been divided from the original tract. 
9.  If the use of an exemption is determined to be an evasion of MSPA, the landowner may submit a subdivision application for the proposed land division. 
C.  Exemption as a Gift or Sale to a Member of the Immediate Family (76-3-207(1)(b), MCA). 
1.  Statement of Intent: The intention of this exemption is to allow a landowner to convey one parcel to each member of the immediate family without local subdivision review. A single parcel may be conveyed to each member of the immediate family under this exemption in each county where the landowner owns property. 
2.  "Immediate family" is defined as the spouse, children by blood or adoption, or parents of the grantor (76-3-103(7), MCA). 
3.  Any certificate of survey filed that would use this exemption to create a parcel for conveyance to a family member must clearly identify the name of the grantee, the grantee's relationship to the landowner, and the parcel to be conveyed under this exemption, and be accompanied by, or contain, the landowner's written certification of compliance. The certificate of survey or other instrument must also cite the exemption claimed and include the language provided in Section H of this Chapter. Also, the certificate of survey or instrument of conveyance shall be accompanied by a deed or other conveying document. 
4.  One conveyance of a parcel to each member of the landowner's immediate family is eligible for exemption from subdivision review. However, the use of the exemption may not result in more than one remaining parcel of less than 160 acres. 
5.  Any proposed use of the family conveyance exemption to divide a tract that was previously created through use of an exemption shall be presumed to be an evasion of the Act if it creates a pattern of development consistent with an overall plan with characteristics such as common roads, utility easements, restrictive covenants, open space or common marketing. This presumption will not be rebutted by previous ownership of the tracts, and pertains to remaining tracts of less than 160 acres as well as to those tracts that were previously created through the use of one or more of the exemptions. 
6.  The use of the family conveyance exemption to divide tracts that were created as part of an overall development plan with characteristics such as common roads, utility easements, restrictive covenants, open space or a common marketing or promotional plan shall be presumed that the use of the exemption is an evasion the Act. 
D.  Exemption to Provide Security for a Construction Mortgage, Lien or Trust Indenture (76-3-201(1)(b) MCA). 
1.  Statement of Intent: Under policies of many lending institutions and federal home loan guaranty programs, a landowner who is buying a tract with financing or through a contract for deed is required to hold title to the specific site on which the residence will be built. The intended purpose of this exemption is to allow a landowner who is buying a tract using financing or a contract for deed to segregate a smaller parcel from the tract for security for financing construction of a home on the property. 
2.  When claiming this exemption, the landowner shall submit the following documents to the City-County Planning Department: 
a.  A signed statement from both the landowner and the lending institution that the creation of the exempted parcel is necessary for the owner to secure construction financing through a construction mortgage, lien or trust indenture on the exempted parcel. 
b.  Any certificate of survey that uses this exemption must bear the acknowledged certificate of the property owner stating that the division of land in question is exempted from review as a subdivision, cite the exemption claimed, and include the language provided in Section H. of this Chapter. 
3.  The use of this exemption is presumed to have been adopted for the purpose of evading MSPA if: 
a.  It will create a site for more than one dwelling unit; 
b.  The loan is for someone other than the owner of record or the recorded contract purchaser of the parcel to be divided. 
c.  It will create a pattern of development which is equivalent to a subdivision with characteristics such as common roads, sewer, water, utility easements, restrictive covenants, open space or a common marketing or promotional plan. 
E.  Exemption for Agricultural Purposes (76-3-207 (1)(c), MCA). 
1.  Statement of Intent: The intention of this exemption is to allow a landowner to create a parcel without local review where the parcel will be used only for production of livestock or agricultural crops and where no residential, commercial, or industrial buildings will be built. 
2.  "Agricultural Purpose," for purposes of these evasion criteria, means the use of land for raising crops or livestock, or for the preservation of open space, and specifically excludes residential structures and facilities for commercially processing agricultural products. Agricultural lands are exempt from review by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), provided the applicable exemption is properly invoked by the property owner. 
3.  The following conditions must be met or the use of the exemption will be presumed to have been adopted for the purposes of evading MSPA: 
a.  The parties to the transaction by gift, sale, or agreement, must enter into a covenant running with the land and revocable only by mutual consent of the governing body and the property owner that the divided land will be used exclusively for agricultural purposes or open space. The covenant must be signed by the property owner, the buyer or lessee and the governing body. An example of a covenant is provided in Section H. of this Chapter. 
b.  The landowner must demonstrate that the planned use of the exempted parcel is for agricultural purposes and that no residential, commercial or industrial buildings will be built (e.g., a statement signed by the buyer). 
c.  Any change in use of the land for anything other than agricultural purposes subjects the parcel to full review as a subdivision. 
d.  Residential, commercial and industrial structures, including facilities for commercial processing of agricultural products are excluded uses on parcels created under this exemption unless the covenant is revoked and the land division is reviewed under MCA Title 76, Chapter 3. 
e.  A certificate of survey that uses this exemption must bear the acknowledged certificate of the property owner stating that the division of land in question is exempted from review as a subdivision, cite the exemption claimed, and include the language provided in Section H. of this Chapter. 
F.  Relocation of Common Boundary (76-3-207(1) (a, d and e), MCA). 
1.  Statement of Intent: The intended purpose of this exemption is to allow a change in the location of a boundary line between two parcels and to allow a one-time transfer of a tract to effect that change in location without subdivision review. 
2.  If the relocation of a common boundary would result in the permanent creation of an additional parcel of land, the division of land must be reviewed as a subdivision. If a temporary tract is created, language shall be added to indicate that the temporary tract is merged forever with the adjacent tract. 
3.  Within a platted subdivision, a division of lots that redesigns or rearranges six or more lots must be reviewed and approved by the governing body and an amended plat must be filed with the County Clerk and Recorder in accordance with Section 306 of these Regulations. 
4.  Certificates of survey or amended plats claiming this exemption must be clearly distinguished between the existing boundary location and the new boundary. This shall be accomplished by representing the existing boundary with a dashed line and the new boundary with a solid line. The appropriate certification must be included on the certificate of survey as provided in Section H. of this Chapter. 
G.  Remainder Parcels. 
Statement of Intent: Any part of an original tract of record, less than 160 acres that is left following the segregation of other parcels from the tract for the purpose of transfer shall be reviewed as part of the subdivision. 
H.  Certification. 
1.  Exemption Certificates. The following represents examples of certificates to be used on certificates of surveys for the following types of exemptions: relocation of common boundaries, land gift or sale to family member, agricultural exemption, and security for constructions. 

Relocation of Common Boundary 

Family Gift or Sale 

For Agricultural Purposes 

Security for Construction 
2.  Governing Body Certification. If the exemption is approved after appeal to the Governing Body, the Governing Body shall so certify in a printed certificate on the Certificate of Survey.

American Title has agreed to act as escrow agent for the purposes of receiving the above-referenced funds and disbursing the same for payment of future SID assessments upon formation of one or more such districts, or for the payment of one or more private contract costs of constructing the Improvements contemplated by the SIA in the event an SID is not formed, which funds will be obtained, held and disbursed by American Title in accordance with the terms of this agreement. 
    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the parties do hereby agree as follows: 
1.  Escrowed Funds. Purchaser shall deposit the Estimated Costs in the amount of     (spell out)     Dollars ($___________) (the "escrowed funds") into escrow with American Title in an interest bearing account under Purchaser's Federal Identification Number # ________________, for the benefit of Purchaser and the City (the "Escrow Account") at the closing of the sale of the Purchaser's Lot, by Seller to Purchaser.

2.  Seller's Obligation Terminated. From and after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall have no further obligation or liability for the Estimated Costs, or the construction and/or payments for the Improvements, or any future SID assessments, relating to the Purchaser's Lot. 
3.  Purpose of Escrow Arrangement.

4.  Payments from Escrow. Upon receipt of a written authorization from Purchaser and the City for payments in connection with actual SID assessments or private contracts for construction of the Improvements, American Title shall disburse the escrowed funds as follows: 
(a)  If one or more special improvement districts are created the escrowed funds shall he paid by American Title to the City for application to the actual assessments for the Improvements against the Purchaser's Lot. 
(b)  In the event one or more special improvement districts for the Improvements is not or cannot be created, then the amounts held on deposit in the Escrow Account shall be applied toward payment under one or more private contracts for construction of the Improvements attributable to the Purchaser's Lot in accordance with the SIA. 
5.  Interest on the Escrowed Funds. Interest accrued on the escrowed funds shall be paid to Purchaser in annual disbursements on the first day of December of each year, until such time as final disbursement is made pursuant to paragraph 6 below.

If the Improvements are constructed by one or more private contracts and the actual amount of the private contracts for the Improvements attributable to the Purchaser's Lot is greater than the escrowed funds held in the Escrow Account with respect to the Purchaser's Lot, then the Purchaser shall be responsible for said difference. If the actual amount of the special improvement district assessments or the private contracts for the Improvements is less than the escrowed funds held in the Escrow Account, then American Title shall return such excess to Purchaser after payment of the full amount of the actual SID assessments or the private contracts, and Purchaser shall be entitled to retain such excess.

No payment made under this Agreement with respect to a private contract for all or any portion of the Improvements shall be evidence of the performance of said private contract, either wholly or in part, and no payment or disbursement by American Title shall be construed to be an acceptance by either Purchaser or the City of defective work or improper materials pursuant to such private contract. 
9.  Rights and Duties of American Title.

(1)  Adopt an official water service area which specifically designates that particular territory which is to be served with water service from the water supply system; 
(2)  Adopt an official wastewater service area which specifically designates that particular territory which is to be served with wastewater service from the wastewater system. 
(3)  Provide for an orderly, planned, and cost effective method of enlarging the service area so adopted; 
(4)  Promote annexation to the corporate city limits of all properties to be served from the water supply system and by the wastewater system. 
(5)  Ensure public participation and comment in the decision making process with respect to all enlargements of the service areas. 
(Ord. No. 85-4618, § 1(18.05.010), 1-14-85) 
Sec. 26-202. - Adoption of service area. 
    The official water or wastewater service area for the city is that area of the city within the boundaries of the city, any areas presently served outside the city and any subsequently approved amendments thereto. A map depicting the water service area adopted herein, and any enlargements that may be from time to time approved by the city council, shall be made available at all times for public inspection during regular working hours at the Utility Service Center, 2251 Belknap Avenue, Billings, Montana. A map depicting the wastewater service area shall be developed and maintained in the same manner. 
(Ord. No. 85-4618, § 1(18.05.020), 1-14-85; Ord. No. 06-5356, § 4, 1-9-06) 
Sec. 26-203. - Prerequisite to application. 
    Unless this section is waived by the mayor and city council as provided in section 26-207, the following conditions shall be met prior to making application for enlargement of the service area: 
(1)  The property at the time the application is filed shall be: 
a.  Contiguous to the boundary of the service area as same exists; 
b.  Entirely within the city's Red Area on the Limits of Annexation Map; 
c.  Entirely within the city's facilities planning area. 
(2)  Applicant shall complete annexation requirements. 
(3)  Provided, that should a state or federal governmental entity, as a condition of providing funds or grants, require that service be extended to other areas outside the scope of this section (section 26-203), the city council may, upon receipt of application for waiver and upon a proper showing, waive the requirements of this section. 
(Ord. No. 85-4618, § 1(18.05.030), 1-14-85; Ord. No. 11-5535, § 2, 6-13-11; Ord. No. 16-5673, § 1, 6-27-16) 
Sec. 26-204. - Annexation requirements. 
(a)  Unless this section is waived by the mayor and city council as provided in section 26-207, all properties to be included within the service area shall be annexed or an attempt at annexation shall be made first and before any service area enlargement applications may be considered. Further, that whenever possible the property being considered for inclusion in the service areas shall be annexed to the city rather than accepting waivers of the property owner's right to protest annexation of said property to the city. Waivers may be accepted by the city in its sole discretion only in those particular cases where good and sufficient cause is shown and a hardship would result if waivers were not accepted. 
(b)  A prospective applicant shall first petition the city to annex the property involved prior to submission of a service area enlargement application. The city council shall then consider such petition. Any waivers must be in legal form as approved by the city attorney; be recorded with the County Clerk and Recorder, Yellowstone County, Montana; run with the land; and shall be signed by owners of the majority of the land area and by a majority of the land owners of the area to be considered for inclusion in the water service area.

No. 06-5356, §§ 14, 15, adopted January 9, 2006. 

Sec. 26-601. - Purpose, policy, applicability and authority of the city. 
(a)  Purpose. This article sets forth uniform requirements for industrial users of the city's publicly owned treatment works (POTW) and enables the city to comply with applicable state and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1251 et seq.), the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403) and the city's Montana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (MTPDES) permit. The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will interfere with or upset the operation of the POTW or interfere with sludge use or disposal. 
(2)  Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which may pass through the system without adequate treatment and into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system. 
(3)  Prevent water quality violations resulting from direct discharges into waters of the state, or violations of the MTPDES permit for the wastewater system treatment plant. 
(4)  Improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludges from the system. 
(5)  Provide for equitable distribution of the costs of the program. 
(6)  To provide for and promote the general health, safety and welfare of the citizens residing within the city and connecting jurisdictions. 
(7)  Enhance the efficiency and cost-effective operation of the POTW. 
(8)  Protect the health and safety of city wastewater system workers and the general public. 
(9)  Protect the municipal wastewater system and wastewater treatment plant from physical damage. 
(b)  Policy. This article provides for the regulation of industrial users of the city's wastewater system through implementation and enforcement of the industrial pretreatment program. The city is authorized to issue industrial discharge permits to industrial users enforce pretreatment standards and requirements, monitor discharges to the POTW, require industrial user monitoring and reporting and take other actions to meet the objectives of this article. The industrial pretreatment program protects the wastewater system treatment and hydraulic capacity, improves the ability to serve existing and new customers within the service area of the wastewater system, outlines fees and charges for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein and establishes penalties and remedies for violations of pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(c)  Applicability. Any industrial user, the discharge from which directly or indirectly enters the city's POTW from areas within or without the boundaries of the city, shall be bound by this article as amended. This article may be enforced against any industrial user. It shall be unlawful for any industrial user to discharge any domestic or non-domestic wastewater into any natural waterway, any surface drainage, or storm drain in any area under the jurisdiction of the city. No industrial wastewater shall be discharged to the POTW unless done so in compliance with the provisions of this article. Where an owner of property leases premises to a person as a tenant under any rental or lease agreement, if either the owner or the tenant is an industrial user, either or both may be held responsible for compliance with the provisions of this article. Except as otherwise provided herein, the administrator shall implement, administer and enforce the provisions of this article. 
(d)  Authority of the city. 
(1)  Except as otherwise specified, the city administrator shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article. Any powers granted to or duties imposed upon the city administrator may be delegated by the city administrator to other city personnel. 
(2)  The city shall attempt to notify in writing any industrial user whom they have cause to believe is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard or requirement, or other applicable requirements promulgated by the EPA under the provisions of Section 204(b) or 405 of the Act, or under the provisions of Sections 3001, 3004, or 4004 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Failure of the city to so notify industrial users shall not relieve said industrial users from the responsibility of complying with applicable requirements. It is the responsibility of significant industrial users to apply for and receive a permit prior to discharge, whether or not the industrial user has been identified and formally requested to do so. 
(3)  If wastewaters containing any pollutant, including excess flow, or as otherwise defined in this article, are discharged or proposed to be discharged to the POTW, the city may take any action necessary to: 
(i)  Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater; 
(ii)  Require an industrial user to demonstrate that in-plant facility modifications will reduce or eliminate the discharge of such substances in conformity with this article; 
(iii)  Require treatment, including but not limited to storage facilities or flow equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the potential for a discharge to violate this article; 
(iv)  Require the industrial user making, causing or allowing the discharge to pay any additional cost or expense incurred by the city for handling, treating, disposing or remediation costs as a result of wastes discharged to the wastewater treatment system; 
(v)  Require the industrial user to apply for and obtain a permit; 
(vi)  Require timely and factual reports from the industrial user responsible for such discharge; or 
(vii)  Take such other action as may be necessary to meet the objectives of this article.

Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the administrator for review and shall be acceptable before discharge from the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. 
(b)  Wastewater discharge control. The city may require an industrial user to restrict discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specified sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and demonstrate the industrial user's compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(c)  Flow equalization. The city may require any industrial user discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An industrial discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(d)  Monitoring facilities. The city may require an industrial user to install at the industrial user's expense, suitable monitoring facilities, instrumentation or equipment that allows for the representative sampling and accurate observation of wastewater discharges. Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications. Monitoring equipment and structures shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all times to city personnel. The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the industrial user's premises outside of the building unless otherwise approved by the city. When such a location would be impractical, the city may allow such facility to be constructed in the public street or easement area, with the approval of the agency having jurisdiction over such street or easement, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(e)  Multitenant buildings. When more than one industrial user is able to discharge into a common service line, the city may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each industrial user. 
(f)  Flow, pH, LEL and other appropriate meters and instrumentation.

The completed application for the industrial discharge permit must be filed at least ninety (90) days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence. 
(c)  Existing industrial users: Applying for an industrial discharge permit re-issuance. An industrial user with an expiring industrial discharge permit shall apply for a new permit by submitting a complete permit application at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the industrial user's existing permit. The industrial user shall file a permit application on forms provided by the city containing the information specified in subsection (f) below. An Industrial User with an existing permit that has filed a complete and timely application may continue to discharge as approved in writing by the city through an administrative extension of the existing permit if the delay in permit issuance is not due to any act or failure to act on the industrial user's part. 
(d)  Other industrial users. The city may require other non-significant industrial users to apply for and obtain wastewater discharge permits or similar control mechanisms necessary to carry out the purposes of this article. The city may issue a zero discharge permit to prohibit the discharge of some or all non-domestic process wastewater from an industrial user. 
(e)  Enforceability. Any violation of the terms and conditions of an industrial discharge permit, failure to apply for a permit as required, or discharging without a required permit shall be deemed a violation of this article and subjects the industrial user to enforcement by the city. Obtaining an industrial discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all state and federal pretreatment standards or requirements.

(2)  Where the city is establishing enforceable permit specific pretreatment standards or requirements, the permit shall be noticed for public comment for thirty (30) days in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice. The city shall consider all comments that are received prior to issuing the permit. 
(3)  The city shall issue an industrial discharge permit to the applicant if the city finds that all of the following conditions are met: 
(i)  The applicant has provided a timely and complete permit application to the city; 
(ii)  The proposed discharge by the applicant is in compliance with the limitations established in this article; 
(iii)  The proposed operation and discharge of the applicant would permit the normal and efficient operation of the POTW; and 
(iv)  The proposed discharge by the applicant would not result in a violation by the city of the terms and conditions of its MPDES permit or cause pass through or interference. 
(4)  If the city finds that the condition set out in subsection (3)(ii) of this section is not met, the city may, at their discretion, issue an industrial discharge permit to the applicant if the conditions set out in subsections (3)(i), (3)(iii) and (3)(iv) of this section have been met and if the applicant submits, and the city approves, a compliance schedule setting out the measures to be taken by the applicant and the dates that such measures will be implemented to assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards. At no time shall a discharge be allowed to cause a violation of any general or specific prohibition established in section 26-604 nor shall the final compliance date for a categorical pretreatment standard be extended. 
(5)  Any person, including the industrial user, may petition the city to reconsider the terms of an industrial discharge permit within thirty (30) days of the permit issuance. Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal. In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the wastewater discharge permit. The effectiveness of the industrial discharge permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal. If the city does not act on such appeal within thirty (30) days, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not to reconsider, not to issue an industrial discharge permit, or not to modify a permit, shall be considered final administrative action for purposes of judicial review. 
(h)  Transferability. Industrial discharge permits are issued to a specific industrial user for a specific operation. An industrial discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new industrial user, different premises, or a new or changed operation without the prior written approval of the city. Any succeeding owner shall comply with the terms and conditions of the existing permit until a new permit is issued. The permittee shall notify the city at least fourteen (14) days prior to any change of ownership. 
(i)  Industrial discharge permit conditions. Industrial discharge permits shall be expressly subject to all provisions of this article and all other applicable regulations, user charges and fees established by the city. Permits may contain the following:

Sec. 26-609. - Reserved. 
Sec. 26-610. - Sample collection and analytical methods. 
(a)  Sample collection. Compliance determinations with respect to prohibitions and limitations in this article may be made on the basis of either grab or composite samples of wastewater as specified by the city. Such samples shall be taken at a point or points which the city determines to be suitable for obtaining a representative sample of the discharge. Composite samples may be taken over a 24-hour period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as determined by the city to meet specific circumstances. 
(b)  Sample type. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, and based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsections (2) and (3) below, the industrial user must collect representative wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is required by the city. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the permitted discharge. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composited samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous local limits, including pH. 
(3)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in section 26-611, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical representative sampling data do not exist. Where historical data are available, the city may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by subsection 26-611(a), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(c)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analysis, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of an industrial discharge permit application, report, permit or other analyses required under this article shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the city or other parties approved by the EPA. 
(d)  [Records.] Records shall include for all samples: 
(1)  The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; 
(2)  The date(s) analyses were performed; 
(3)  Who performed each analysis; 
(4)  The analytical techniques/methods used, including method detection limits and QA/QC sample results; 
(5)  Calibration and maintenance records; 
(6)  All chain-of-custody records; and 
(7)  The results of each analysis.

Sec. 26-611. - Reporting and notification requirements. 
(a)  Periodic compliance reports-All significant industrial users. 
(1)  Any significant industrial user or other industrial user required by the city, subject to a federal, state, or city pretreatment standard or requirement must submit reports, at a frequency determined by the city but no less than once per six (6) months, indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practices (BMPs) or pollution prevention alternatives, the industrial user must submit documentation required by the city or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine compliance status of the industrial user. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (h). 
(2)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that the sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(3)  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the city, using the methods and procedures prescribed in section 26-610, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(4)  The sampling and analyses required for the reporting outlined above may be performed by the city in lieu of the permittee. Where the city itself makes arrangements with the industrial user to collect all the information required for the report, the industrial user will not be required to submit the report. 
(b)  Baseline monitoring reports (BMR)-Categorical industrial users. 
(1)  Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR Section 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the city a report which contains the information listed in subsection (2) below. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard, shall submit to the city a report which contains the information listed in subsection (2) below. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged from regulated process streams and other non-process streams. 
(2)  Industrial users described above shall submit the information set forth below. 
(i)  All information required in subsection 26-606(f). 
(ii)  Measurement of pollutants. 
(A)  The industrial user shall take a minimum of one (1) representative sample to compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
(B)  Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the industrial user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in 40 Section CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the city. 
(C)  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with section 26-610. 
(D)  The city may allow the submission of a BMR which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. 
(E)  The BMR shall indicate the time, date, and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
(F)  Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed in accordance with subsection (h) and signed by an authorized representative as defined in section 26-602. 
(c)  Ninety-day compliance reports-Categorical industrial users. 
(1)  New sources. All new sources subject to existing categorical pretreatment standards shall submit a report to the city within ninety (90) days from the date of first discharge to the POTW demonstrating actual and continuing compliance with those standards. 
(2)  Existing sources. All existing sources required to comply with newly promulgated categorical pretreatment standards shall submit a report to the city within ninety (90) days of the date on which compliance is required with those standards demonstrating that actual and continuing compliance with such standards has been achieved. 
(3)  Such 90-day compliance report shall contain at a minimum the information required in subsections 26-606(f)(6), (7), (10), (11), (12), and (13). 
(d)  Twenty-four-hour notice and 30-day re-sampling. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation of this article, the industrial user shall notify the city within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is not required to resample if the following occurs: 
(1)  The city performs sampling at the industrial user's facility at a frequency of at least once per month. 
(2)  The city performs sampling at the industrial user's facility between the time when the industrial user performs its initial sampling and the time when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling. It is the sole responsibility of the industrial user to verify if the city has performed this sampling. 
(e)  Slug discharge control plan. 
(1)  Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental and slug discharges of pollutants regulated under this article. Facilities to prevent the discharge of spills or slug loads shall be provided and maintained at the industrial user's expense. 
(2)  The city shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs a slug discharge control plan or other action to control spills and slug discharges. The city may require an industrial user to develop, submit for approval, and implement a slug discharge control plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control spills and slug discharges. 
(3)  A slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
(i)  Detailed plans (schematics) showing facility layout and plumbing representative of operating procedures; 
(ii)  Description of contents and volumes of any process tanks; 
(iii)  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
(iv)  Listing of stored chemicals, including location and volumes; 
(v)  Procedures for immediately notifying the city of any spill or slug discharge. It is the responsibility of the industrial user to comply with the reporting requirements in subsection (f); 
(vi)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response; and 
(vii)  Any other information as required by the city. 
(4)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of an accidental or slug discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who work in any area where an accidental or slug discharge may occur or originate are advised of the emergency notification procedures. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems-Slug and spills. 
(1)  In the case of any changes at its facility affecting potential for a slug discharge as defined in section 26-602 or any actual discharge, including, but not limited to, spills, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a discharge that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the industrial user shall immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident.

(Ord. No. 13-5600, § 1(Att. A), 5-28-13) 
Sec. 26-614. - Compliance and enforcement. 
(a)  Enforcement response plan. The city may adopt policies and procedures as set forth in the city's enforcement response plan for carrying out the provisions of this article, provided that such policies and procedures are not in conflict with this article or any applicable state or federal law or regulation. 
(b)  Publication of industrial users in significant noncompliance. The city shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the significant industrial users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. In addition, any industrial user found to be in significant noncompliance with subsections (3), (4) or (8) shall also be published in the newspaper. The following criteria shall be used to define significant noncompliance: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of all of the measurements taken during a six-month period exceed, by any magnitude, a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of all of the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the administrator determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of city personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or the environment or has resulted in the city's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days after the schedule date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide, within thirty (30) days after the due date, required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation or group of violations which may include a violation of best management practices, which the administrator determines may adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(c)  Administrative enforcement actions. 
(1)  Notice of violation (NOV). When the city finds that an industrial user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an industrial discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may serve upon the industrial user a written notice of violation. Within five (5) working days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction of prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the industrial user to the city. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the industrial user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(2)  Suspension of service. 
Endangerment to health or welfare of the community: The city, through other than a formal notice to the affected industrial user, may immediately and effectively halt or prevent any discharge of pollutants into any natural waterway, surface drainage within the city, any area under jurisdiction of the city, the POTW of the city or any wastewater system tributary thereto, by any means available to them, including physical disconnection from the wastewater system, whenever it reasonably appears that such discharge presents an imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of the community. 
Endangerment to environment or treatment works: The city, after written notice to the industrial user may halt or prevent any discharge of pollutants into any natural waterway, surface drainage within the city, any area under jurisdiction of the city, the POTW, wastewater system tributary thereto, by any means available to them, including physical disconnection from the wastewater system, whenever such discharge presents or may present an endangerment to the environment or threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW. 
Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the industrial discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to individuals or the environment. The city may reinstate the industrial discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge. 
A detailed written statement submitted by the industrial user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measure taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be provided to the city within five (5) days of the date of occurrence. Suspension of service shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the industrial user. 
(3)  Administrative compliance order. When the city finds that an industrial user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an industrial discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that the industrial user come into compliance within a specific time. If the industrial user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the industrial user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the industrial user. 
(4)  Consent order. The city may enter into a consent order, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any industrial user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific actions to be taken by the industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. A consent order may include penalties, supplemental environmental projects, or other conditions and requirements as agreed to by the city and the industrial user. 
(5)  Show cause hearing. 
(i)  The city may order any industrial user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before the administrator why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the industrial user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the administrator regarding the violation, the reasons why the proposed action is to be taken, and directing the industrial user to show cause before the administrator why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or be sent by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
(ii)  The administrator may conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may designate one or more persons to conduct the hearing and to take the following actions: 
(A)  Issue subpoenas requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings, The administrator or the industrial user may petition the municipal court to enforce any subpoena issued pursuant to this section through the court's contempt powers. 
(B)  Receive evidence from both the industrial user and the administrator on any relevant issue involved in such hearings, provided however, that the Montana Rules of Evidence shall not apply strictly to such evidence. 
(C)  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the administrator for final action thereon. 
(iii)  At any hearing held pursuant to this article, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded. The transcript of testimony will be made available to any member of the public and any party to the hearing upon payment of reasonable charges for the preparation thereof. The hearing may be suspended or continued from time to time in the discretion of the presiding officer, provided that all evidence is received and the hearing is closed within sixty (60) days after it is commenced. 
(iv)  After the administrator has reviewed the evidence, they may issue an order of findings and take an action or no action as necessary and appropriate. 
(6)  Cease and desist order. 
(i)  When the administrator finds that an industrial user is violating this article, an industrial discharge permit, any order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the industrial user's past compliance history indicates that violations are likely to recur, the administrator may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the industrial user to: 
(A)  Immediately comply with all requirements; 
(B)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
(ii)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the industrial user. 
(7)  Administrative fines. When the city finds that an industrial user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an industrial discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may fine such industrial user in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day per violation. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines may be assessed for each day during the period of violation. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the industrial user. 
(d)  Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(1)  Injunctive relief. When the city finds that an industrial user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an industrial discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may petition the Billings Municipal Court for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the industrial discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of an industrial user. The city may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the industrial user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against an industrial user. 
(2)  Civil penalties. 
(i)  An industrial user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an industrial discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day per violation. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties may accrue for each day during the period of violation. 
(ii)  The city may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
(iii)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the city shall take into account all relevant circumstances including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the industrial user's violation, corrective actions by the industrial user, the compliance history of the industrial user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(iv)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against an industrial user. 
(3)  Civil/administrative fine pass through. In the event that an industrial user discharges such pollutants which cause the city to violate any condition of its MPDES permit and the city is fined by the EPA or the state for such violation, then such industrial user shall be fully liable for the total amount of the fine assessed against the city by the EPA and/or the state. 
(4)  Criminal prosecution. 
(i)  Any industrial user who violates or fails to comply with any provision of this article or with any orders, rules, regulations, permits and permit conditions issued hereunder, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty for such misdemeanor shall be a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) or by imprisonment not to exceed six (6) months, or both. 
(ii)  Any industrial user who knowingly makes, authorizes, solicits, aids, or attempts to make any false statement, representation or certification in any hearing, or in any permit application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article, or who falsifies, tampers with, bypasses, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device, testing method, or testing samples required under this article, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisonment not to exceed six (6) months, or both. 
(iii)  The city may refer violations that warrant criminal prosecution to the U.S. Attorney General's Office, State Attorney General or USEPA Criminal Investigation Division or other appropriate agency. Such referral shall not preclude the city from taking a parallel administrative or civil enforcement action. 
(e)  Cost recovery. In any judicial action, the city may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs, deposition and delivery costs, expert witness fees, and other expenses of investigation, enforcement action, administrative hearings, and litigation if the city prevails in the action or settles at the request of the defendant. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this article or the rules and regulations shall become liable to the city for any expense, loss, or damage to the city or to the POTW occasioned by such violation including, but not limited to, investigative/monitoring expenses, fines, penalties, cleaning, repair or replacement work caused by and in connection with the violation. In addition, upon proof of willful or intentional meter bypassing, meter tampering, or unauthorized metering, the city shall be entitled to recover as damages three (3) times the amount of actual damages. 
(f)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive of any other remedies that the city may have under the provisions of state law. 
(Ord. No. 13-5600, § 1(Att. A), 5-28-13) 
Sec. 26-615. - Pretreatment authority outside of city. 
    In order to achieve and maintain compliance with the Clean Water Act, federal pretreatment requirements, state regulations, sewage grant conditions and MPDES discharge permit requirements, the city, as manager/operator shall have the authority to implement and enforce the pretreatment program against any industrial user within and outside of the city's territorial jurisdiction who discharges directly or indirectly to the POTW or any collection system connected to the city POTW. 
    To that end, all governmental sewage connectors, municipalities and sanitation districts, shall be required to adopt a regulatory pretreatment program either: 
(1)  Is consistent with and as stringent with this article and the rules and regulations; or 
(2)  Incorporates by reference the provisions of this article and the rules and regulations and specifically delegates authority to implement and enforce the pretreatment program to the city. 
    Connectors, municipalities, sanitation districts, shall also be required to approve necessary revisions to existing sewer service agreements or joint agreements granting the city the right to administer and physically enforce the connector's pretreatment program on behalf of and as agent for the connector district. 
(Ord. No. 13-5600, § 1(Att. A), 5-28-13) 
Sec. 26-616. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset. 
(1)  For the purposes of this article, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (3) below are met. 
(3)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(i)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(ii)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(iii)  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the city within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days): 
(A)  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
(B)  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
(C)  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have burden of proof. 
(5)  Industrial users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Industrial users shall control (decrease) production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(b)  Prohibited discharge standards. An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the specific prohibitions in any action brought against it alleging a violation of the specific prohibitions in subsections 26-604(b)(3), (4), (5), (6) or (7) where the user demonstrates that: 
(1)  It did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference; and 
(2)  The industrial user had accurately disclosed the concentration of the pollutant(s) causing the pass through or interference in applications, reports, or other required documents as required; and either: 
(i)  A local limit designed to prevent pass through and/or interference, as the case may be was developed for each pollutant in the industrial user's discharge that caused pass through or interference, and the industrial user was in compliance with each such local limit directly prior to and during the pass through or interference; or 
(ii)  If a local limit designed to prevent pass through and/or interference, as the case may be, has not been developed for the pollutant(s) that caused the pass through or interference, the industrial user's discharge directly prior to and during the pass through or interference did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge activity when the POTW was regularly in compliance with the POTW's MPDES permit requirements and, in the case of interference, applicable requirements for sewage sludge use or disposal. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  For purposes of this subsection: 
(i)  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
(ii)  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (3) and (4) of this section but are reportable under subsections 26-611(a), (d), (f), (j) and (k), as appropriate. 
(3)  Notice. 
(i)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, if possible, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass. 
(ii)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the administrator within twenty four (24) hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The administrator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty four (24) hours. 
(4)  Prohibition of bypass. 
(i)  Bypass is prohibited, and the administrator may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
(A)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(B)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
(C)  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (3) of this section. 
(ii)  The administrator may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the administrator determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection (4)(i) of this section.

Sec. 27-301. - Zoning Districts. 
    It is the intent of this section to establish zones wherein compatible uses of land may be located to create, protect and maintain a desirable living environment, to stabilize and protect residential harmony and to conduct profitable businesses. It is also the intent of this Chapter to make it possible to efficiently and economically design and install public facilities in terms of size and capacity to adequately meet the needs resulting from a defined intensity of land use. 
    To carry out the provisions of this chapter, the city and county 41/2 mile jurisdictional area is hereby divided into the following zoning districts in which the erection, construction, alteration, reconstruction, repair or use of buildings, structures and land shall be regulated and restricted. The regulations in each district shall be uniform throughout each district but may differ from those in other districts.

    A-1 Agricultural-Open Space (county only): A district to protect and preserve agricultural lands for the performance of a wide range of agricultural functions. The intent is to limit the scattered intrusion of uses not compatible with an agricultural environment; to encourage agricultural pursuits and protect environmental concerns. 
    A-S Agricultural-Suburban (county only): A district to protect and preserve agricultural lands for the performance of limited agricultural functions and to provide a buffer between urban and unlimited agricultural uses and to encourage concentration of such uses in areas so that potential conflict between uses will be minimized. 
    R-150 Residential 15,000 (county only): A zone intended to provide for low density, single-family residential developments in areas which may or may not be serviced by a public water and/or sewer system. 
    R-96 Residential 9,600: A zone intended to promote primarily a single-family residential environment on lots that are served by public water and sewer service. 
    R-80 Residential 8,000: A residential zone intended to primarily provide a single-family residential environment with provisions for duplexes that are served by public water and sewer service. 
    R-70R Residential 7,000 Restricted: a residential zone intended to primarily provide a single family residential environment on smaller lots at a medium density that are served by a public water and sewer service.

    RMF Residential Multi-family: A residential classification intended to provide adequate sites for multi-family developments including high-rise apartment complexes. Dwelling unit density is increased in this classification to encourage development in areas where it will complement existing developments. Land within the classification should be located with access to major arterial transportation routes plus financial, cultural and retail stores and be served by public water and sewer services. 
    RMF-R Residential Multi-family-Restricted: A residential classification intended to provide adequate sites for multi-family developments. The classification is intended to provide higher density apartment development, which may establish a buffer between single-family residence areas and other zoning classifications.

Only uses serving the above purpose without undue detriment to surrounding residences should be permitted. 
    CC Community Commercial: The community commercial zone is intended primarily to accommodate community retail, service and office facilities offering a greater variety than would normally be found in a neighborhood or convenience retail development. Facilities within the classification will generally serve the community, and is commensurate with the purchasing power and needs of the present and potential population within the trade area. It is intended that these business facilities be provided in business corridors or in islands (thirty (30) acres) centrally located in the trade area rather than a strip development along arterials.

Areas designated as Highway Commercial should be located in the vicinity of, and accessible from interstate interchanges, intersections on limited access highways, or adjacent to primary or secondary highways. The manner in which the services and commercial activities are offered should be carefully planned in order to minimize the hazard to the safety of the surrounding community and those who use such facilities. 
    CBD Central Business District: The central business district classification is intended to primarily accommodate stores, hotels, governmental and cultural centers and service establishments at the central focal point of the city's arterial and transportation system, where the C.B.D. can conveniently serve the population of the entire urban area with a varied and specialized selection of goods and services. In order to protect the public interest and welfare and facilitate an attractive, efficient and prosperous C.B.D., the emphasis is on larger scale building and specialty shops. 
    CI Controlled Industrial: The controlled industrial zone is intended to accommodate a variety of business, warehouse and light industrial uses related to wholesale plus other business and light industries not compatible with other commercial zones, but which need not be restricted in industrial or general commercial zones, and to provide locations directly accessible to arterial and other transportation systems where they can conveniently serve the business and industrial centers of the city and county. 
    HI Heavy Industrial: A zone intended to accommodate manufacturing, processing, fabrication, and assembly of materials and products. Areas designated as Heavy Industrial should have access to two (2) or more major transportation routes, and such sites should have adjacent space for parking and loading facilities.

ARTICLE 27-400. - NONCONFORMING LOTS AND USES OF LAND, STRUCTURES, NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND USES OF STRUCTURES[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 97-5048, § 4, adopted Dec. 22, 1997, repealed former Art. 27-400, §§ 27-401-27-422, in its entirety which pertained to the South 27th Street Permit Zoning District. See the Code Comparative Table for a listing of ordinances affecting these former sections. 

Sec. 27-401. - Intent. 
(a)  The provisions of this chapter shall apply to buildings, structures, lands and uses which become nonconforming as a result of the application of this Resolution/Ordinance [Ord. No. 97-5048, adopted Dec. 22, 1997] to them, or from classification or reclassification of property under Ord. No. 97-5048 or any subsequent amendments thereto. If a use originally authorized by a variance, special review or other valid use permit prior to the effective date, as defined in below subsection (b) of this resolution/ordinance is located within a district in which such use is not permitted by the terms of this resolution/ordinance, such use shall be a nonconforming use; however, pre-existing valid uses requiring a special review after the effective date of this resolution/ordinance shall not require a special review. 
(b)  The effective date for these regulations is May 3, 1972 for any property that was located within the limits of the City of Billings on or before that date. 
The effective date for any property located within the Yellowstone County 41/2 mile jurisdictional area, but outside the limits of the City of Billings is on or before November 6, 1973. 
(c)  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of Ord. No. 97-5048 and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. "Actual construction" is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in a permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently. 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 4, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-402. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
(a)  In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this resolution/ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any vacant single lot of record at the effective date of adoption, as defined in above subsection (b), or amendment of this resolution/ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of contiguous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that the yard dimensions, lot coverage and other requirements not involving area of the lot shall conform to the regulations of the district in which such lot is located. An additional variance of area and yard requirements shall be obtained only through affirmative action by the board of adjustment (see BMCC sections 27-1501, et seq.) 
(b)  If two (2) or more vacant lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with contiguous frontage in single ownership or record exist at the time of adoption, as defined in Section 27-401, subsection B, or amendment of this resolution/ordinance, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot area as established by this resolution/ordinance, the land involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this resolution/ordinance, and no portion of the parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet lot area requirements established by this resolution/ordinance, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot, with area below the requirements stated in this resolution/ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 4, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-403. - Nonconforming uses of land. 
    Where, on the effective date of adoption, as defined in Section 27-401, subsection B, or amendment of this resolution/ordinance, lawful use of land exists that is no longer permissible under the terms of this resolution/ordinance as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(a)  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption, as defined in Section 27-401, subsection B, or upon amendment of this resolution/ordinance. 
(b)  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption, as defined in Section 27-401, subsection B, or upon amendment of this resolution/ordinance. 
(c)  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of one (1) year or more, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this resolution/ordinance for the district in which such land is located. 
Within a period of one (1) year or less, a manufactured home used for residential purposes which is a legal nonconforming use of land may be replaced by another manufactured home for residential purposes, so long as the new home is not substantially larger than the manufactured home that it replaced. In addition, the new manufactured home shall meet the minimum yard setback requirements including arterial setbacks (see BMCC Section 27-602), along with lot coverage requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 4, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-404. - Nonconforming structures. 
    Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption, as defined in Section 27-401, subsection b, or amendment of this resolution/ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this resolution/ordinance by reason of restriction on area, lot coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(a)  No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity unless an enlargement or structural alteration makes the building more conforming or is required by law. 
(b)  Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this resolution/ordinance. 
(c)  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(d)  Structural alterations may be permitted if necessary to adapt a nonconforming building to new technologies or equipment pertaining to uses housed in such building. Any enlargement necessary to adapt to new technologies shall be authorized only by a variance, as described in BMCC sections 27-1506 (City) and 27-1511 (County). 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 4, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-405. - Nonconforming uses of structures. 
    If a lawful use of a structure or of structures and premises in combination exists at the effective date of adoption, as defined in Section 27-401, subsection B, or amendment of this resolution/ordinance, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this resolution/ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(a)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this resolution/ordinance in the zone in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the zone in which it is located. 
(b)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption, as defined in section 27-401, subsection (b), or amendment of the resolution/ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
(c)  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structures and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the governing body with jurisdiction on the property shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the governing body with jurisdiction on the property may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Any proposed change from one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use shall be processed and reviewed under the special review provisions of BMCC sections 27-1501, et seq., and the following criteria shall be considered: 
(1)  The nature and purpose of the existing nonconforming use; 
(2)  The difference in quality and character of the proposed use; 
(3)  The difference in the degree of use of the proposed use, including but not limited to hours of operation and parking requirements; 
(4)  The reasons for the proposed change; and 
(5)  The overall impact of the proposed use on the surrounding property. 
(d)  Any structure, or structures and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure(s) is located, and the nonconforming use may not be thereafter resumed. 
(e)  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structures and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for one (1) year or more, the structure, or structures and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located. Abandonment shall include, but not be limited to, cessation of the use for one (1) year or more. 
(f)  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of the replacement cost at time of destruction. 
(g)  Any sexually oriented business, located within the limits of the City of Billings, existing upon passage of this chapter which does not comply with the requirements established herein shall be deemed a legal nonconforming use. All existing legal nonconforming sexually oriented businesses, as of the effective date of this chapter, or any amendment hereto, shall comply with the provisions of this chapter within four (4) years from the date of the enactment of this section or any amendment thereto. (Refer also to BMCC Section 27-611.)

b.  Noncontributing. Those buildings and structures within a historic district not listed in the city historic preservation survey, and those buildings and structures determined by the preservation board to be of no contributing value. 
(5)  All commercial districts listed in the National Register of Historic Places within the city automatically become part of the local register. Commercial buildings individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places within the city may petition to become part of the local register by request of the owner of record of said National Register property. This petition must be submitted to the city council. 
(6)  Individually listed residential buildings and/or residential districts listed in the National Register of Historic Places within the city may petition to become part of the local register.

(5)  Whether there are definite plans for immediate reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what effect those plans will have on the character of the surrounding area.

Sec. 27-611. - Sexually oriented businesses. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. It is the purpose of this section to regulate sexually oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, morals, and the general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable uniform regulations to prevent the continued deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly it is not the intent or effect of these regulations to restrict or deny access by adults to distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of these regulations to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials. 
(b)  Findings and determinations. The city council hereby finds and determines that: 
(1)  The establishment of adult uses in business districts which are immediately adjacent to and which serve residential neighborhoods has a deleterious effect on both the business and residential segments of the neighborhood, causing or contributing to blight and a downgrading of property values. 
(2)  The establishment of more than two (2) adult uses within six hundred (600) feet of each other has a deleterious effect on surrounding residential and business areas and the fostering of such businesses within a close proximity tends to create a "skid row" atmosphere. 
(3)  The location of several adult uses in the same neighborhood tends to attract an undesirable quantity and quality of transients, a circumstance which adversely affects property values, causes an increase in crime and encourages residents and businesses to move elsewhere. 
(4)  Concern for, and pride in, the orderly planning and development of a neighborhood should be encouraged and fostered in those persons comprising residential and business segments of that neighborhood. 
(c)  Definitions. Terms used in this section, that are not specifically defined below, may be found in section 27-201. Where other definitions are necessary and are not defined in this section or section 27-201, the dictionary may define such terms.

(d)  Medical corridor and South 27th Street corridor signs. 
(1)  Statement of special purpose. 
a.  Medical corridor. The Billings Medical Corridor Permit Zoning District as set forth in article 27-900 (the "medical corridor") is a unique, distinct and separately identifiable area of the city. Over time, a majority of the medical corridor has developed a campus environment that is separate and distinct from the surrounding area. The large scale buildings, the complexities of the medical campuses, the needs and abilities of those seeking medical and emergency services, and the diversification of services offered within the medical corridor create a need for flexibility in establishing clear way-finding and informational signage. Accordingly, this special medical corridor sign code is adopted to facilitate, enhance, encourage and promote the following purposes: 
1.  To facilitate and foster complementary uses servicing the healthcare community, including hospitals, clinics, medical office buildings, laboratories, and related or supporting uses; 
2.  To promote a unique, attractive and distinctive healthcare campus environment with limited retail uses; 
3.  To encourage creativity and continuity in design, quality, and the character of new signage; 
4.  To anticipate and recognize the needs of patients and visitors in the medical corridor; 
5.  To safeguard and enhance property values, and to protect public and private investment in the medical corridor; 
6.  To promote those qualities in the visual environment which bring economic value to the community; 
7.  To encourage the design of signs that are in harmony with the principal activities and structures that they serve and that are compatible with the overall healthcare campus environment; 
8.  To alleviate the burdens of complex compliance and enforcement responsibilities; and 
9.  To promote the public safety, welfare, convenience and enjoyment of travel and the free flow of traffic within the medical corridor. 
The medical corridor is primarily occupied by regional healthcare providers that draw patients and visitors from a multi-state region. The medical corridor sign code recognizes that patients and visitors to the medical corridor need to be able to easily and conveniently locate, identify, and find their way to hospitals, medical groups, clinics, medial departments, laboratories, physicians, and other healthcare points of interest. 
The primary purpose of the medical corridor is healthcare, with very limited retail uses. Accordingly, the medical corridor sign code recognizes that the primary purpose of signs in the medical corridor is not for retail purposes, yet retains historical restrictions for retail establishments within the medical corridor. 
The caliber of the development of the medical campuses within the medical corridor over time has demonstrated a commitment to maintaining architecturally sound and aesthetically pleasing signage, as well as uniform appearance of signage within parcels under common ownership. Healthcare and healthcare providers are constantly evolving and changing. One of the express purposes of the medical corridor sign code is to provide healthcare providers with flexibility with respect to both way-finding and informational signage. 
b.  South 27 th Street corridor. This section acknowledges the architectural visual concerns associated with the South 27 th Street corridor zoning district as set forth in article 27-800. This section further recognizes the needs and benefits of limited sign standards that will adequately serve the uses in this zoning district and those who utilize their services, and at the same time, recognizes the need to protect the remaining residential areas within, adjacent and surrounding these zoning districts from the intrusion of unsightly, excessive and confusing sign usage. 
(2)  Healthcare purposes sign definition. As used within this section, the term healthcare purposes sign shall mean any sign located in the medical corridor (excluding prohibited signs) that: 
a.  Identifies a hospital, clinic, medical building, healthcare facility, emergency room, trauma center, healthcare provider or ancillary healthcare service (as defined herein below), and/or associated parking areas located in the medical corridor; or 
b.  Provides direction to a hospital, clinic, medical building, healthcare facility, emergency room, trauma center, healthcare provider or ancillary healthcare service, and/or associated parking areas located in the medical corridor.

Sec. - 27-735. 
General sign criteria. 
    In the Montana Avenue sign district all signs must receive approval by the sign committee. A set of both absolute and relative criteria has been established which gives the assurance that the signs erected are compatible with the nature and character of this district and to encourage creativity that is not permitted under traditional sign regulations. 
    An applicant must meet all the absolute criteria to qualify for a permit. In addition the applicant must also attain a minimum of at least seventy (70) percent of the maximum points possible, in order to obtain a sign permit, in the relative category. 
(Ord. No. 99-5098, § 1, 8-9-99) 
Sec. 27-736. - Specific criteria. 
(a)  The absolute criteria must be satisfied before approval can be granted. This includes sign type, number, size, and location. Each of the applicable absolute criteria must be answered yes before approval can be granted. 
(b)  Relative criteria are assessed using a "point" system. Each sign must achieve a specified minimum percentage of these criteria. A score above the minimum percentage may be used to receive extra points. The absolute criteria are designed to reduce the negative impacts, while the relative criteria focus on the actual design of a sign including, but not limited to: compatibility with the building's architecture, the design compatibility with the era of the district, building, color, location on the building, materials used, lighting, size, and dimensions, and creativeness of design. The design of a sign is evaluated against the relative criteria and scored on a point chart. 
(c)  A sign shall be evaluated as follows: 
(1)  Absolute criteria. Each of the absolute criteria is answered yes, no, or not applicable. A "no" answer to any applicable absolute criteria will automatically exclude the application, as proposed, from further consideration at that time. Modifications will need to be made to correct any problems before further consideration will be given to the sign proposal. 
(2)  Relative criteria. The signage plan is evaluated against each applicable relative criterion and assigned a "score." A sign may receive a score of 0 to 10, with 10 being the highest. The numerical score is assigned based on the following (Only 0, 5, and 10 are defined as points of reference): 
10 = For an excellent job of implementing the criteria or for doing the best job possible, given the constraints and opportunities of the site. 
 5 = For an adequate job of implementing the criterion. 
 0 = For no effort or failure to implement the criterion.

3.  Building elevation drawings showing the location of all existing signs and the location of the sign being applied for; 
4.  A scaled drawing of the sign including: sign design, types of material, colors, style of lettering, etc. 
b.  The sign administrator will, at that time, review the application for completeness. If the application is incomplete, it will be returned to the applicant. 
c.  Upon receipt of a complete application, the sign administrator will notify the applicant of the meeting date, time, and location with the Montana Avenue sign review committee. 
d.  The review will result in approval, disapproval, or approval with modifications. Once approval has been granted the sign administrator will issue the permit upon receipt of payment. 
e.  A sign permit application will be valid for one hundred twenty (120) days. The application may be extended for one (1) additional sixty-calendar-day period. The request for extension must be in writing and received five (5) business days prior to the expiration of the sign permit.

No. 97-5048, § 7, adopted Dec. 22, 1997, repealed former Art. 27-900, §§ 27-901-27-905, in its entirety which pertained to nonconforming uses and enacted new provisions as herein set out. See the Code Comparative Table towards the end of this volume for listing of ordinances amending former Art. 27-900. 

Sec. 27-901. - Title. 
    This article shall be known, cited and referred to as the "Medical Corridor Permit Zoning District [Regulations]." 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 7, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-902. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to promote the most compatible, rational pattern of land uses in the medical corridor while establishing a core area in Billings which has a concentration of facilities offering medically-related services. To that end, a permit system has been developed to best accomplish this goal for a centralized area which is also designed for compatibility with neighboring, existing land uses. 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 7, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-903. - Criteria generally. 
    In the medical corridor no specific land use is automatically allowed on a particular site as is the case under traditional zoning districts. Instead, a set of both absolute and relative criteria has been established which gives greater assurance that a centralized medical area can exist and be compatible with adjacent land uses, as well as, foster a healthy growth pattern in the medical corridor. Site and development plans are required to evaluate an applicant's success or failure to address these criteria. If the criteria are met, the land use may proceed. A developer must meet all the absolute criteria to qualify for a permit. In addition, in the relative criteria category, the developer must also attain a minimum of at least seventy (70) percent of the maximum points possible in order to proceed if the proposed development is medically-related and seventy-five (75) percent if it is not medically-related to quality for a permit. (See BMCC section 27-912, "Land use relative criterion" for definitions of land use). The requirements and procedures of this newly adopted district are contained in this part. 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 7, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-904. - Official zoning map. 
    In order for the changes in zoning within this district to become effective, they must be entered on the official zoning map which is located in the office of the Yellowstone County board of planning. Such map shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land inside the city. 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 7, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-905. - Boundaries. 
    The boundaries of the Medical Corridor Permit Zoning District are described as follows: 
    The area in the city which is inside the boundaries described, beginning with the point of intersection of center lines of 7th Avenue North and North 27th Street; thence in a northwesterly direction along the centerline of North 27th Street to the intersection of North 27th Street and Poly Drive; thence westerly along the centerline of Poly Drive to the intersection of Poly Drive and North Broadway; thence southeasterly along the centerline of North Broadway to the intersection of North Broadway and the northern border of Lot 15, Block 2, Normal Subdivision; thence southwesterly along the northern border of Lot 15 to the alley; thence in a northwesterly direction along the centerline of the alley to Poly Drive; thence westerly along the centerline of Poly Drive to the intersection of Poly Drive and North 29th Street; thence southeasterly along the centerline of North 29th Street to the intersection of North 29th Street and Elevation Avenue; thence southwesterly along the centerline of Elevation Avenue to the intersection of Elevation Avenue and Grandview Boulevard; thence westerly along the centerline of Grandview Boulevard; to the intersection of Grandview Boulevard and Locust Street; thence southerly along the centerline of Locust Street to the intersection of Locust Street and the vacated portion of Elevation Avenue (Resolution 83-14404 vacated Elevation Street between North 30th and North 31st Streets on September 26, 1983); thence northeasterly along the centerline of the vacated portion of Elevation Avenue to the intersection of vacated Elevation Avenue and the alley between North 31st Street and North 30th Street; thence southeasterly along the centerline of the alley to the intersection of the alley and 7th Avenue North; thence northeasterly along the centerline of 7th Avenue North; to the intersection of 7th Avenue North and North 27th Street, which is the point of beginning.

Medical Corridor Permit Zoning District 
Sec. 27-906. - Medical corridor permit zoning system process. 
(a)  The permit zoning system process is a review of development proposals against a set of absolute and relative criteria. Permit zoning allows those land uses that can meet the criteria pertinent to a specific site. 
(b)  Every land use must satisfy the criteria listed in the "all development" category, as well as, any other applicable criteria from the "special requirements" categories. The specific criteria which a proposal must satisfy are dependent upon the type of land use being proposed. 
(c)  The absolute criteria must be satisfied before approval can be granted. These include assuming compatibility and compliance with adopted official plans, minimum engineering and public service requirements and environmental standards as outlined in this document. Each of the applicable absolute criteria must be answered yes before approval can be granted. 
(d)  Relative criteria are the "points" of the system. Each development must achieve a specified minimum percentage of these criteria. A score above the minimum percentage may be used to receive extra points. The absolute criteria are designed to address public service requirements and reduce negative impact of development, while the relative criteria focus on the actual design of a project including but not limited to: building layout, open space, landscaping, pedestrian circulation, and architectural design. The design of a site plan is thus evaluated against the relative criteria and scored on a point chart. 
(e)  The performance of a particular development plan shall be evaluated as follows: 
(1)  Absolute criteria. Each of the absolute criteria is answered yes, no, or not applicable. A "no" answer to any applicable absolute criteria will automatically exclude the plan, as proposed, from further consideration. Modifications to correct any problems would have to be made before further consideration could be given to the development proposal. 
(2)  Relative criteria. The development plan is evaluated against each applicable relative criteria and assigned a "score." The numerical score is assigned based on the following: 
2 = For an excellent job of implementing the criteria or for doing the best job possible, given the constraints and opportunities of the site. 1 = For an adequate job of implementing the criterion. 0 = For no effort or failure to implement the criterion.  
Each relative criteria has been preassigned a "multiplier" which determines the relative importance of that criterion to the other criteria. The meaning of each multiplier is as follows: 
3 = Very important 2 = Average importance 1 = Minor importance  
    The points earned for each criterion are the product of multiplying the "score" times the "multiplier." The maximum points possible in each category are added together, as are the total points earned by the proposal. The points the proposal has earned must equal at least seventy (70) percent of the maximum points possible in order to proceed if the proposed development is medically-related and seventy-five (75) percent if it is not medically-related. The objective is to receive the maximum number of points. 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 7, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-907. - Special requirements. 
    The following special requirements shall apply to any area development. 
(1)  Residential developments. The maximum density permitted shall not be allowed as a matter of right, and the actual density shall be as determined by the final plan and approved in accordance with the permit zoning process. A score of seventy-five (75) percent or more must be achieved among the relative criteria for a proposal which is not medically-related to proceed. 
(2)  The city shall have the right to establish general design standards, guidelines, and policies, for the purpose of implementing and interpreting the permit zoning. 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 7, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-908. - Procedures. 
(a)  Conceptual review. This is an opportunity for applicants to discuss requirements, standards, and policies that apply to development proposals. Major problems can be identified and solved before a formal application is made. The applicant must arrange a conceptual review meeting with the zoning coordinator or his/her designee. Representatives of the building, engineering, parks and recreation, community services, city-county health, public works administration, public utilities, fire, traffic and planning departments will be sent notification of the conceptual review meeting along with copies of building and/or site plans. Should it be necessary, department representation may be reviewed and changed, subject to the city administrator's directive. Representatives from the departments will decide at the conceptual review whether any of the absolute or relative criteria are not applicable for the application in question and whether their department needs to participate at the preliminary and final review stages. 
The general outline of the proposal, evidenced schematically by sketch plans, shall be submitted by the applicant and reviewed by the zoning coordinator. Following the review the zoning coordinator shall furnish the applicant with written comments regarding the application, including appropriate recommendations to inform and assist the applicant prior to preparing the formal application. 
The applicant shall allow two (2) weeks from the conceptual review meeting for written staff evaluation of the conceptual review and the recommendation(s) of the zoning coordinator. 
(b)  Preliminary plans. An application for preliminary review may be filed with the zoning coordinator upon completion of the conceptual review meeting and after the recommendation of the zoning coordinator has been made. If the zoning coordinator has not made written comments within the required two (2) weeks after the conceptual review, then the applicant may submit a preliminary plan at any time thereafter. It is at this point that the applicant addresses the pertinent absolute and relative criteria. A review meeting is held between the applicant, zoning coordinator, and other departments and agencies. Adjacent property owners (including the property owners adjacent to, in the rear of and to either side, and directly across the street from and to either side of the proposal site) will be invited to attend and participate in the meeting. Adjacent property owners will be notified by the zoning coordinator by letter which includes a brief explanation of what the developer proposes to build so those persons have an opportunity to review and comment on the proposal and to attend the preliminary plan review meeting. The preliminary plan review meeting will be held within thirty days (30) days of the submittal unless the developer agrees to an extension. 
Two (2) weeks from the review meeting date are allowed for the written evaluation of the preliminary plan by the appropriate departments/agencies having responsibility for review of such proposals, as determined by the zoning coordinator. 
If approval is granted following the review, then preliminary approval will be valid for one hundred eighty (180) days. 
Applications requiring a major subdivision, abandonment of rights-of-way or other items requiring city council action by ordinance will be subject to city council approval before the final plan approval can be granted. 
If no revisions are required of the preliminary plan, then the plan shall be automatically considered as the final plan and the final plan review meeting will be waived. 
(c)  Final plans. The submittal of the final plan follows within one hundred eighty (180) days of the granting of the preliminary plan, and it will be in substantial compliance with the approved preliminary plan. The submitted final plan will not: 
(1)  Change the use or character of the development; or 
(2)  Cause changes in the development that will reduce the total points earned by more than five (5) percent or to a point below the minimum point total required for the proposed development. 
A final plan review meeting will be held within thirty (30) days of the final plan submittal, between the applicant, zoning coordinator, as well as, other departments and agencies. Adjacent property owners will again be invited to attend and participate in the meeting. As with the preliminary plan review, the zoning coordinator shall notify adjacent property owners by letter of the final plan submittal, inviting their comments prior to and at the meeting. The zoning coordinator will distribute plans to the departments and agencies which participated in the conceptual and preliminary reviews for their evaluation. The applicant shall allow thirty (30) days from the date of submittal for receipt of the written staff evaluation of the final plan review. 
Applicant and adjacent property owners dissatisfied with the decision of the zoning coordinator shall have the process of appeal to the city council, as outlined below in section 27-916. 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 7, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-909. - Content of development submittal. 
(a)  Applications for site and building permit review are not required for the conceptual review, as this stage of the process is intended to allow the developer to meet informally with the zoning coordinator and other appropriate staff to determine if the proposal is worth pursuing before he/she has incurred any substantial expense. The conceptual review stage is also provided so that a developer can obtain initial feedback from the zoning coordinator as to what he/she and other departments may want to include in the preliminary and final plans. 
(b)  For the preliminary and final review process, copies of the site plan and complete building and supporting data, as determined necessary, shall be submitted to the zoning coordinator, along with the application fee which shall be set by the city administrator. In this regard, the following will be required: 
(1)  A legal and general description of the tracts upon which review is sought. 
(2)  Names and addresses of owners of real property adjacent to the project site plus legal descriptions of the adjacent properties. 
(3)  Statement of proposed use. 
(4)  A site plan at a suitable scale (no greater than 1" = 4' or no less than 1" = 50'), and indicating: 
a.  Suggested plans for proposed storm water drainage system sufficient to drain and dispose of all surface water accumulation within the area, indication of sanitary sewer, water, gas, electric, etc., easements, and written notifications that they have been reviewed by the city engineer and public utilities department for feasibility purposes; 
b.  Landscape plans including species, size and spacing of trees and shrubs; 
c.  Locations of all existing and proposed buildings, recreation areas, utility and service areas, fire hydrants, access drives, full width of street and adjacent drives, parking areas, storage areas, existing and proposed utility lines, and easements; 
d.  Location and description of all other existing and proposed site improvements including fences, walls, signs, lighting, walkways, patios, decks, and barriers; 
e.  A clear delineation of all areas to be paved or surfaced, including a description of surfacing material to be used; 
f.  The planned use of all yards; 
g.  Location and description of all off-site improvements and right-of-way dedication; and 
h.  Payment of application fees. 
(5)  Building plans for all structures including: 
a.  The size, alignment and intended use of all structures; 
b.  Architectural plans for proposed buildings complete with exterior finishes and including floor plans and elevations; and 
c.  These plans shall also indicate unit sizes, ratios of dwelling unit to total lot sizes and parking spaces. 
(6)  A timetable for the proposed construction project. 
(7)  Any other information pertinent to the particular project which, in the opinion of the zoning coordinator and/or city staff, is determined to be necessary for the review of the project (i.e., traffic accessibility study). 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 7, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-910. - Review procedures. 
    The following review procedures have been established to assure that the process as outlined in this document is handled in a smooth and timely manner for a developer in the medical corridor and to protect the interests of adjacent property owners. 
(1)  It will be the responsibility of the zoning coordinator to process permit requests under this system in the following manner: 
a.  A developer will bring his/her request for a permit to the planning department. 
b.  The zoning coordinator shall determine the time and place of the conceptual plan review with the developer. A formal application and payment of any required fees under this system is not required at this time. 
c.  The zoning coordinator shall notify all departments and/or agencies regarding the conceptual review meeting. Those parties will determine whether their attendance is necessary at the future meetings. 
d.  Following the conceptual review the applicant shall pay required fees and prepare a formal application at the time of preliminary plan submittal. 
e.  The zoning coordinator shall distribute copies of building and site plans submitted at the preliminary plan review stage and the final plan stage to all departments and/or agencies who have participated in the conceptual review. 
f.  The zoning coordinator shall notify adjacent property owners, by certified letter, of the development proposal and afford them the opportunity to review the preliminary plan after submission to the zoning coordinator. Staff will have thirty (30) days to review the preliminary plan and adjacent property owners are encouraged to give their comments during this period prior to the preliminary plan review meeting so that the developer can be made aware of any major differences or concerns on the part of any adjacent property owners to the development proposal. Feedback during this period will also minimize any major problems for the developer and the city prior to approval of the final plan. If necessary, the zoning coordinator can arrange a separate meeting between the developer and adjacent property owners to resolve differences. Adjacent property owners will be invited to attend the preliminary plan review meeting. 
g.  Following the preliminary plan review meeting the zoning coordinator shall again notify adjacent property owners as outlined in this document, by letter, of the time and place of the final plan review meeting to afford them another opportunity to comment on the proposal. 
Should either the developer and/or adjacent property owner be dissatisfied with the final decision, either party has the right to appeal the decision directly to the city council as outlined in BMCC section 27-916 of this document. 
(2)  The review may result in disapproval, approval, or approval with certain conditions of the proposed development. Approval of the preliminary plan does not constitute final approval, but rather indicates an expression of intent. The issuance of the building permit itself constitutes final approval. 
(3)  Activities authorized by granting of the building permit shall be initiated within six (6) months and completed within twelve (12) months after issuance of the permit, or within the approved time schedule submitted and approved for larger projects. The building official has the ability to grant a six (6) month extension under this system. Time schedules are included to assure the timely development of the area. Should the time period expire and an extension is not granted, the developer shall file a new application which will require resubmission of building and site plans and payment of fees as in the original application, as outlined in BMCC section 27-909 of this document.

    A proposal must receive a "yes" answer to all applicable criteria in order to qualify for approval. 
Building 
Standards: 
Does all construction conform to the adopted building and site development codes? 
All structures to be constructed in the medical corridor shall require site approval by the Planning and Engineering Departments and building plan approval by the Building Official before a building permit can be issued. Any structure will also require Fire Department approval of the structure's fire design.

Department:      
     
      
Criterion complied with: Yes   No   
Standards: 
No definite answer exists for the amount of new development which could be sustained in the medical corridor area because it depends upon the type of development proposed. Assessing the capacity of existing sewer and water lines is very difficult on a small scale basis due to a number of variables. 
Large multiple family, commercial, and institutional complexes or projects would require increased capacity in order to meet the sanitation, water and fire protection needs. Property owners and developers of such complexes will be required to comply with the Public Utilities Department policy regarding fire suppression water facilities, stating that: 
It is the Public Utilities Department's policy to require property annexed to the City of Billings and property rezoned or redeveloped within the corporate city limits to upgrade water lines and appurtenances and to install the proper number of fire hydrants, if necessary, in order to provide the required fire suppression water for the city's fire department. Such facilities shall be constructed by public works contractors either by special improvement district methods or by private contract and the cost of such construction will be directly assessed to the properties benefitted from the construction of said facilities. 
Property owners and developers will have to include the cost of upgrading the water and sanitary sewer mains and appurtenances and installing the proper number of fire hydrants within their expected cost of development. Since the utility systems rely on system components outside the immediate development area for proper functioning, upgrading may involve more than just those facilities in the specific development site area. Any designs for the upgrading of water mains, appurtenances, and fire hydrants must have plans and specifications stamped by a Montana Registered professional engineer. Any such plans and specifications must be approved by the Public Utilities Department and the State Department of Environmental Quality. 
The Billings Fire Department will determine the required fire suppression water flow. 
Vehicular 
Traffic: 
What will be the impacts of the traffic generated by the proposed development project, and how does the developer propose to mitigate these impacts? 
In assessing these impacts the developer should be as specific as possible in addressing the present and future capacity of the street system so that the city traffic engineer can evaluate the proposed development. 
Developer:      
     
      
City Traffic 
Engineer:      
     
      
Criterion complied with: Yes   No   
Standards: 
If development generates more than five hundred (500) vehicle trips a day, an accessibility study will be required. See BMCC Section 6-1208(d). Traffic accessibility studies will also be required if the proposal includes a drive-up window or special traffic characteristics: 
BMCC Section 27-604: (Fences and Hedges); and 
BMCC Section 27-615: (Visibility at Intersections). 
See the report entitled "Traffic Accessibility Studies" available from the Traffic Engineering Division, if there are any questions regarding whether an accessibility study is required and what its contents should be. 
Pedestrian 
Access: 
Pedestrian access must be provided to every building in the proposed development. It may be achieved in two (2) ways: "Public," as normally required and specified in the engineering standards of the city, and/or "private," a system of pedestrian sidewalks and paths which provides to the satisfaction of the city equal or better performance than the "public" system. The developer is to assess the condition of the present city sidewalks.

Example. If an alley is vacated, any and all public utilities located therein will have to be relocated at the expense of the developer or owner as the city will not want public utilities such as sewer and water lines located within privately-owned land. 
Lighting: 
Is sufficient exterior lighting proposed and will it be installed so the light source sufficiently avoids spillover of light and glare on operators of motor vehicles, pedestrians, and land uses in the proximity of the light source? (This criterion does not include public street lighting which is regulated under the public facilities criterion.)

Definitions: 
Candlepower: The amount of light that will illuminate a surface one foot distant from a light source to an intensity of one footcandle. Peak candlepower is the largest amount of candlepower emitted by any lamp, light source, or luminaire. 
Cutoff: The point at which all light rays emitted by a lamp, light source, or luminaire are completely eliminated at a specific angle above the ground. 
Cutoff angle: The angle formed by a line drawn from the direction of light rays at the light source and a line perpendicular to the ground from the light source, above which no light is emitted. 
Cutoff-type luminaire: A luminaire with elements such as shields reflectors, or refractor panels which direct and cut off the light at a cutoff angle that is less than ninety (90) degrees. 
Footcandle: A unit of illumination produced on a surface, all points of which are one (1) foot from a uniform point source of one candle. 
Luminaire: A complete lighting unit consisting of a light source and all necessary mechanical, electrical, and decorative parts. 
Maximum permitted illumination: The maximum illumination measured in footcandles at the interior bufferyard line at ground level in accordance with the following standards. 
The maximum height of light posts is correlated to the amount of cutoff provided. Exterior lighting must meet one of these options: 
A.  When a light source or luminaire has no cutoff: 
Maximum permitted illumination - 0.30 
Maximum permitted height of luminaire - 20 feet 
No Cutoff Luminaire 
NO CUTOFF LUMINAIRE 
B.  When a luminaire has total cutoff of an angle equal to ninety (90) degrees, the maximum illumination and the maximum permitted luminaire height shall be:

Note: 
All medically-related proposals must achieve a minimum score of seventy (70) percent of the applicable criterion points possible in the relative criteria rating before a project can be approved, in addition to receiving "yes" answers to all applicable absolute criteria. If the land use proposal is not medically-related, then the proposal must achieve seventy-five (75) percent of the total points possible plus a "yes" answer to all applicable absolute criteria. Thus if all the relative criteria are applicable, a project must score forty (41) points (seventy (70) percent) or forty-four (44) points (seventy-five (75) percent), depending on its land use. 
Building 
Scale: 
The scale of a building (its height, bulk, setback, and lot coverage) is encouraged to be sensitive to the immediate environment and, when possible, compatible in appearance with the scale of neighboring buildings. Property located between North 30th Street and the alley toward North 31st Street must maintain at least a ten (10) foot minimum setback from the alley. Where access is a problem for fire equipment, the Fire Department will require built-in fire protection systems.

Compatibility: 
All efforts toward promoting neighborhood compatibility are encouraged, such as: 
1.  Having resolved all differences between proposed development and the affected neighborhood; 
2.  Keeping the development compatible with and sensitive to the immediate environment of the site and neighborhood relative to architectural design; scale, bulk and building height, disposition and orientation of buildings on the lot, and visual integrity; 
3.  Having conflicts between the proposed development and the surrounding land uses effectively mitigated; and 
4.  Designing the project so that any additional traffic generated does not have significant adverse impact on surrounding development, and the street system.

Standards 
and Scoring: 
Compatibility has been stressed throughout this document. The reason for that is the desire to protect the residents in the area and to preserve the neighborhood-type setting now enjoyed. Past construction activity has threatened that quality, and this chapter is an attempt to instead enhance the area. 
Again, it is recognized that the primary purpose for the corridor is to serve as a central location for medically-related services and products, with all other land uses being secondary in importance. However, the permit zoning system will allow the city to have more control over the area's development than in the past in order to protect both the existing residences and the area to the immediate west of the medical corridor from encroachment by unsightly or inappropriate land uses. At the same time, the city will be able to encourage development which will be beneficial to the entire community in terms of design, health care, and economic return. 
Protection of the remaining areas of single-family residences must be assured through communication between the developers and the property owners, and through design. In particular, compatibility is sought for the homes south of 11th Avenue North on North 30th Street, between 12th and 10th Avenues North on North Broadway, and the areas of homes south of 11th Avenue North on North 29th Street. It is these areas which are most in need of compatible, sensitive development around their environs. 
Points Compatibility Effort 2 Developer met with adjacent property owners on own accord in effort to keep differences to a minimum and achieved high degree of compatibility with immediate environment. 1 Developer either met with adjacent property owners on own accord to assure compatibility or achieved high degree of architectural compatibility. 0 No effort made.  
Access on 
North 27th 
Street: 
If the project is proposed on property adjacent to North 27th Street, it is encouraged that limited access be provided on North 27th Street and, where applicable, side streets be used for accessibility.

Architectural 
Design: 
Development design is encouraged to be either compatible in design with the neighboring properties or promote harmonious transitions in scale and character in areas between different land uses. Design should thus be appropriate to the site and function of the project and should promote interior energy conservation measures.

(a)  Rules and regulations. The city administrator shall promulgate and publish rules and regulations which will be on file at the parks, recreation, and public lands department specifying the plant materials and standards which must be met in order to satisfy the requirements of landscaping and bufferyards. The rules and regulations will be used to determine which plant materials will satisfy the requirements of this chapter. The plant materials are listed by type: Conifers and evergreen trees, evergreen shrubs, deciduous trees, deciduous shrubs, ground covers, and vines. 
Although the rules and regulations will not generally specify the location or spacing of plant material required, all plant materials shall be installed to maximize achieving the purpose(s) for which the planting is required. In the case of bufferyard planting, this means that plant material shall be located so as to achieve the maximum level of protection to the less intense use. 
(b)  Minimum plant size. Unless otherwise specifically indicated elsewhere in this chapter, all plant materials shall meet the minimum size standards set forth in Table 1.

(a)  Should an existing development propose to externally remodel fifty (50) percent or more of the building, have an addition put on in excess of ten (10) percent of the existing building, change its use, or create some nonbuilding improvements (e.g., parking lots, fences), then certain provisions shall be complied with. The property will have to comply with all of the applicable absolute criteria and address four (4) of the relative criteria of the permit system before a permit is issued by the zoning coordinator. 
(b)  Existing developments which involve the external remodeling of less than fifty (50) percent of the building or an addition of ten (10) percent or less onto an existing building must comply with the absolute criteria. The relative criteria will not be addressed by these projects. However, if the existing development is a single-family dwelling or a duplex now meeting and proposed to continue meeting the standards of the residential 6,000 (R-60) zoning category, then it will not need to go through this permit procedure for remodeling, additions, or fences. When these conditions are met, the building permit shall be issued for these development types. 
(c)  Internal remodeling projects (which are not changing the use of the building) will be exempt from this chapter and will go through the regular building permit process. 
(d)  Parking lots for existing developments which are proposed to add ten (10) or fewer spaces for off-street parking will go through this section's process. All other parking lots will go through the entire permit zoning procedure.

(e)  All building permit applications for existing development must receive a "yes" to all applicable absolute criteria plus achieve a minimum score of seventy-five (75) percent among the applicable relative criteria before a project can be approved and a building permit issued. Thus if all four (4) criteria apply, the applicant must achieve at least fifteen (15) points before a permit is issued. The zoning coordinator will notify the applicant of the awarded scores. Depending upon the scope of the project it is suggested that the zoning coordinator "fast track" this process and allow no more than two (2) weeks for departmental review of the preliminary plan BMCC section 27-908(B) and one (1) week for review of the final plan BMCC section 27-908(C). A conceptual review BMCC section 27-908(A) is not required for this section but is highly recommended.

Sec. 27-916. - Appeal process relating to issuance of denial of permit. 
(a)  Generally. The following outlines the appeal process which can be exercised by either a developer who is denied a permit or an adjacent property owner who wishes to protest or appeal the city staff decision to grant a permit for a particular development. 
(b)  Developer appeal. Should a permit be denied, a developer will receive a written explanation from the zoning coordinator as to the reasons for the denial within two (2) weeks of the final plan's submittal. The developer than has fourteen (14) days from the date on the letter in which to file a request for appeal before the city council. The petition requesting an appeal and a copy of the zoning coordinator's letter giving the reason(s) for the denial of the permit shall be filed with the city clerk and shall be placed on the city council agenda within thirty (30) days after receipt of the petition. The city council will review the petition and vote (by simple majority) whether an appeal may be filed for their consideration. If permission to appeal is not granted, then the zoning coordinator's denial of the permit stands. Should permission be given to hear an appeal, then the developer will have thirty (30) days in which to file a written appeal with the city clerk. It shall include a copy of the zoning coordinator's explanation for denial of the permit, and the developer's reasons why the permit should be issued. A copy of this appeal must be sent to the zoning coordinator. 
The city clerk shall then place the item on the city council agenda. The city clerk shall notify all adjacent property owners as outlined in this document, by letter, of the time and place of the city council meeting so that they may appear and comment on the appeal. 
(c)  Adjacent property owner appeal. Once the zoning coordinator decides to grant a permit, the zoning coordinator must notify all adjacent property owners (including all lands directly opposite the site) by letter and inform them that they have fourteen (14) days from the date of the letter to submit a request of an appeal of the decision to the city council. If a request for appeal is not submitted for council consideration, then the decision of the zoning coordinator stands. If the property owners want to submit a petition requesting an appeal, it shall be filed along with the zoning coordinator's letter with the city clerk, and the clerk shall place the petition on the city council agenda within thirty (30) days. Should the council agree to hear the appeal, then the property owners filing the request must submit, in writing, reasons why adjacent property owners feel the permit should not be granted. The filing must take place within thirty (30) days of the granting of permission by the city council to hear the appeal and shall be filed with the city clerk. 
If the affected property owners do not appeal the decision to grant the permit within the fourteen (14) day period, they have waived their right to appeal and the zoning coordinator shall then issue a permit for the proposed development. If a request for an appeal is filed, a copy must be sent to the zoning coordinator by the city clerk, and any issuance of a permit shall be delayed until the city council can resolve the matter.

(4)  Reducing the amount of reflected glare and heat absorbed in and around developments; 
(5)  Breaking up large expanses of parking lots; 
(6)  Preserving property values and neighborhood characteristics by lessening the impacts of potentially incompatible uses; and 
(7)  Providing screening from wind. 
(c)  Conserve water resources by: 
(1)  Promoting the use of xeriscaping and drought-tolerant native plantings; and 
(2)  Promoting the utilization of stormwater detention as an irrigation source. 
(d)  Ensure that landscaping is an integral part of the site design and development process. 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 9, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-1102. - Scope. 
    Development which satisfies one of the following criteria shall be exempt from this section: 
(a)  Single or two-family developments where each unit is located on an individual lot; 
(b)  Submitted or approved plans, building permits and/or development existing prior to the effective date of this chapter shall comply with the regulations which were in effect at the time of approval; or 
(c)  Development located within one of the following zoning classifications: 
(1)  Central business district (C.B.D.) zone. 
(2)  Entryway light commercial (E.L.C.) zone.

(a)  All new development which has not applied for a building permit before the effective date of this chapter; or 
(b)  Existing development in which the gross floor area (GFA) or the number of parking stalls is increased by twenty-five (25) percent. 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 9, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-1103. - Administrative relief. 
    Administrative relief is provided to add flexibility in the application of the landscaping regulations in this section when a standard is inapplicable or inappropriate to a specific use or design proposal. However, the granting of administrative relief should not always mean that a requirement is reduced without compensation. For example, the granting of a reduced bufferyard depth should be compensated by the planting of additional trees, shrubs or other plants. 
    A written request for administrative relief shall be submitted to the planning director or his/her designee either before or in conjunction with the building permit review process. The written request shall include a justification in terms of the findings necessary to grant administrative relief. The written request shall close with a section for the planning department's use which will include a block for the decision of approval/denial, the planning director or his/her designee's signature, and decision date. The written request with decision shall be attached to the plan or retained in the applicable file, as appropriate. An example of this written request shall be available from the planning department. 
    The planning director or his/her designee must make all of the following findings in order to grant administrative relief: 
(a)  The strict application of the regulation in question is unreasonable given the development proposal or the measures proposed by the applicant or that the property has extraordinary or exceptional physical conditions that do not generally exist in nearby properties in the same general area and such conditions will not allow a reasonable use of the property in its current zone in absence of relief; 
(b)  The intent of the landscaping section and the specific regulation in question is preserved; and 
(c)  The granting of the administrative relief will not result in an adverse impact upon surrounding properties. 
    The planning director or his/her designee shall render a decision on the request within five (5) working days of receipt of the request and all required information. An appeal of the planning director's decision may be made to the board of adjustment with jurisdiction over the property, within ten (10) days after the decision. At this time, the appeal will be put on the agenda for the next board of adjustment meeting which allows for the required public notice. 
Policies: 
(1)  The planning department recognizes that the specific landscape requirements in this section cannot and do not anticipate all possible landscape situations. In addition, the planning department recognizes that there may be landscape proposals which conform to the purpose, intent and objectives of the landscape regulations, but were not anticipated in the specific regulations. Therefore, the planning department may grant administrative relief in the event of these situations and proposals. 
(2)  The planning department recognizes that a proposed development of a relatively small commercial or industrial lot which was created prior to the current landscape requirements may present unusual difficulties in complying with the current requirements. 
    The planning department shall attempt to balance the reasonable use of such lot with the provision of required landscaping. This balance will be affected by the site's characteristics, as well as, the proposed development plan. 
    The planning department also recognizes that to allow reasonable development there should be an upper limit to the amount of a site that is required to be landscaped. As a general guideline for relatively small commercial or industrial lots (such as one (1) acre or less), the requirements should not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of a site. 
    The reasonable development of a site may require the granting of administrative relief to some of the requirements. Although all of the categories of landscape requirements are considered important, the planning department generally assigns the following priorities for compliance with the landscape requirements: 
First, adjacent residential uses should be buffered, 
Second, an attractive appearance of the project should be provided along adjacent streets by landscaped setbacks and trees, 
Third, the parking areas and building elevations which form major public views of the project should be visually softened and enhanced by trees and other plantings. 
    Compliance with the requirements, such as the third priority above, should not be "forced" into a site design. For both visual effect and ease of maintenance, relatively few, but larger landscaped areas, which are integrated with the other elements of the site design, are generally encouraged. In addition, relatively numerous and smaller landscaped areas, which are not integrated with the other elements of the site design, are generally discouraged.

ARTICLE 27-1300. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS[16] 

Footnotes: 
--- (16) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 97-5048, § 11, adopted Dec. 22, 1997, repealed former Art. 27-1300, §§ 27-1301-27-1311 in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former Art. 27-1300, §§ 27-1301-27-1311, pertained to interchange/entryway zoning districts. 

Sec. 27-1301. - Intent statement. 
    The intent of this zoning district is to provide flexible land use and design regulations through the creation of individualized planned developments (pd). It is further the intent to encourage unique development or re-development through a flexible, timely and efficient process. Developments which utilize innovative, progressive planning and site design techniques and methods to allow a mixture of land uses, densities, setbacks and building heights will be encouraged. In addition, this zone is intended to encourage the preservation and enhancement of the physical characteristics of the site. 
    It is further intended that each PD zone will be a separate zone, each having differing design criteria to provide for the uses and improvements based on its particular site specific situation. 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 11, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-1302. - Objectives. 
    The planned development (PD) zoning district is intended to include and promote consideration of the following: 
(a)  To permit the development or enlargement of planned industrial, commercial, residential or mixed use development zones, while protecting the character and quality of adjacent uses. 
(b)  To permit clusters of multiple family developments in appropriate locations within single family residential or commercial zones. 
(c)  To permit flexibility in design and use of an individually owned property or a group of separately owned properties to allow for economy, convenience and amenity in development. 
(d)  Preserve, enhance and retain the existing natural environmental qualities in the landscape such as topographic variation, views, water areas and native vegetation. 
(e)  Ensure adequate provision of public services such as water, sewer, public safety, public parks, open space, storm water control and vehicular and pedestrian circulation. 
(f)  Encourage patterns of development which decrease automobile travel and encourage trip consolidation and promotes the use of public transit, bicycles and walking as effective modes of transportation, thereby reducing traffic congestion and degradation of the existing air quality. 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 11, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-1303. - PD zone guidelines. 
    A PD zone is intended to replace the previous zoning classification of the subject property. Areas rezoned in accordance with this chapter shall be designated with a "PD-_" preceding a numerical designation (example: PD-1) and each new PD district shall be added as an amendment to the zoning regulations. 
    The PD zoning district is unique among the zoning districts in that it allows zoning and/or site development standards to be "customized" to fit its particular site and/or development situation. With due consideration of public safety, the Governing Body can approve a PD that permits greater or lesser standards in such areas as density, use, bulk, height, parking, signage, traffic circulation, landscaping, lot sizes or other elements. This may also include permitting the development of amenities such as tennis centers, swimming centers, and other recreational activities such as an equestrian center within the city limits, provided that such an amenity is an integral part of the overall development scheme of the PD. However, these considerations for allowing greater or lesser standards should be balanced within the PD. For example, permitting greater density in a PD could be approved, in exchange for a greater amount of open space than a similar project, not located in a planned development zone, would be required to provide. 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 11, 12-22-97; Ord. No. 02-5193, § 2, 4-8-02) 
Sec. 27-1304. - PD application process. 
    A PD zone shall be established by following the procedure described below, which includes review by city and/or county staff, the city or county zoning commission and the appropriate governing body, including the participation of interested citizens. 
    The applicant is encouraged to submit a proposed PD project for conceptual review with city and/or county staff. This review is intended to get input from staff and to indicate any potential problem areas before a formal application is submitted. 
    If the project is required to go through the subdivision review process, it is recommended that this platting process occur concurrently with the PD zone change process. 
(Ord. No. 97-5048, § 11, 12-22-97) 
Sec. 27-1305. - PD zone change submittal requirements. 
    The applicant or his/her authorized agent shall submit the following information to the planning department to begin the PD zone change process (see also BMCC sections 27-1502 or 27-1508, city and county zoning commissions and city and county boards of adjustment): 
(1)  Legal description of the subject parcel(s), along with a map showing the dimensions, acreage and location of the parcel(s); 
(2)  A certified list of the names, addresses and legal descriptions of the owners of property within a radius of three hundred (300) or more feet, as determined by the zoning coordinator, from the exterior boundaries of the tract(s); 
(3)  Two (2) sets of gummed mailing labels with the names and mailing addresses typed or printed neatly of all of the property owners indicated on the certified list; 
(4)  The names and addresses of the owner(s) of the subject property and their agent(s), if any, along with the recorded property owner's signature; 
(5)  A development plan which shall consist of the following: 
a.  A written text description of the pd, which will be added as an amendment to the zoning regulations. The subjects addressed in the text amendment may refer back to the zoning regulations or site development regulations for the pd's standards or describe the pd's unique standards. This amendment should address some or all of the following subjects: 
1.  Purpose 
2.  Underlying land use classification(s)

Sec. 27-1401. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the Shiloh Corridor Overlay District is to provide standards for industrial, commercial, and mixed-use development as called for in the West Billings Plan. This overlay zoning district is intended to promote an aesthetically pleasing and distinct entryway corridor by encouraging abundant landscaping, attractive building design, and preservation of scenic vistas. Single family and duplex residential development are exempt from the requirements of this overlay zoning district. The overlay zoning does not alter the category of permitted uses in the underlying zoning.

Sec. 27-1402. - District boundaries. 
    The boundaries of the Shiloh Corridor Overlay District shall be that displayed on the map at the end of section 27-1403. In no case shall the boundaries of the district exceed a depth of five hundred (500) feet from the centerline of the right-of-way of Shiloh Road from King Avenue north to Rimrock Road. If only a portion of the property falls within the boundaries of the district, the entire property will be subject to the regulations in section 27-1400. 
(Ord. No. 04-5310, § 1, 12-13-04) 
Sec. 27-1403. - Review criteria. 
(a)  Generally. The Shiloh Corridor overlay district review process is a review of development proposals against a set of absolute and relative criteria. Site and development plans are evaluated to determine whether the proposed development meets the identified criteria. If the criteria are met, the development may proceed. 
    New developments and existing development in which the gross floor area (GFA) or the number of parking stalls is increased by twenty-five (25) percent must comply with these regulations. 
(b)  Absolute criteria. A developer must meet all absolute criteria to obtain planning and community services department approval. The absolute criteria are defined in sections 27-1406 through 27-1408. Absolute criteria also include all other applicable codes, ordinances, and statutes, including, but not necessarily limited to, minimum engineering and building standards, public service and utility requirements, and environmental regulations. 
(c)  Relative criteria. Relative criteria are the "points" of the review process. Each development must obtain a specified minimum number of points based on the relative criteria identified in section 27-1409. The development plans are evaluated against the relative criteria and scored on a point chart.

    An appeal may be made by any applicant aggrieved by a denial of a Shiloh corridor overlay zone permit by the planning and community services department. The applicant shall first appeal to the department director, and if not satisfied with the director's determination, may then file an appeal with city council. The city council shall hold a public hearing and make a determination whether to approve or deny the permit. Before either the director or city council makes a determination on the permit, the following criteria shall be considered:

    Upon receiving written notice of denial of a permit from the planning and community services department, the aggrieved applicant has fourteen (14) days from the date on the notice to submit a written request for appeal to the department director. The director shall meet with the applicant within five (5) days of receiving the request and issue a determination on the decision to deny the permit. If the department director upholds the decision to deny, the applicant may file, within fourteen (14) days from the date of the director's determination, a request for appeal before the city council. If an appeal is requested, the planning and community service director shall: 
(5)  Submit a staff report to the city council within thirty (30) days after receipt of the appeal scheduling a public hearing and describing the nature of the appeal. The memo shall include the request for the appeal and a copy of the notice stating reason(s) for the denial of the permit.

The applicant shall first appeal to the department director, and if not satisfied with the director's determination, may then file an appeal with city council. The city council shall hold a public hearing and make a determination whether to approve or deny the appeal. Before either the director or city council makes a determination on the appeal, the following criteria shall be considered: 
(1)  That the official erred in the interpretation or application of this chapter; 
(2)  That approving the permit will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other land in the same district; 
(3)  That no substantial detriment to the public good is created; 
(4)  That the intent and purpose of this chapter is not impaired. 
    Upon receiving written notice of denial of a permit from the planning and community services department, the aggrieved applicant has fourteen (14) days from the date on the notice to submit a written request for appeal to the department director. The director shall meet with the applicant within five (5) days of receiving the request and issue a determination on the decision to deny the permit. If the department director upholds the decision to deny, the applicant may file, within fourteen (14) days from the date of the director's determination, a request for appeal before the city council. If an appeal is requested, the planning and community service director shall: 
(5)  Submit a staff report to the city council within thirty (30) days after receipt of the appeal scheduling a public hearing and describing the nature of the appeal. The memo shall include the request for the appeal and a copy of the notice stating reason(s) for the denial of the permit.

(7)  Notify, by mail, the party requesting the appeal and all adjacent property owners of the time, date and place of the public hearing and nature of the appeal five (5) days in advance of the public hearing. 
    Upon reversing a decision to deny an appeal, the council may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms upon which the appeal is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.

(a)  Authority. The city board of adjustment shall have the authority to grant a variance from the terms of this chapter in specific cases where it is found that the granting of the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and where, because of special conditions with respect to the lot shape or topography, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the chapter would result in unnecessary hardship. 
(b)  Applications. An application for a variance shall be filed with the zoning coordinator under the following conditions: 
(1)  The application shall include, but not be limited to the following:

(d)  City board of adjustment action. The city board of adjustment, before it grants a variance shall determine: 
(1)  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, the lot or something inherent in the land which causes the hardship, and which are not applicable to other lands in the same district; 
(2)  That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other tracts in the same district;

(2)  That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other tracts in the same district; 
(3)  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other land in the same district; 
(4)  That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and with the comprehensive plan; 
(5)  In granting any variance, the board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Resolution/Ordinance.

(2)  Alteration to an existing principal or accessory structure that results in a change of fifteen (15) percent or more in the structure's gross floor area. 
(3)  When compliance is triggered for existing parking lots, landscape improvements shall take precedence over parking requirements. 
(b)  General requirements. Refer to BMCC section 27-1100 for all landscape requirements, including but not limited to the approval process, materials, installation, and maintenance. However, the EBURD specific standards in this section 27-1815 supersede the requirements of subsections 27-1105 and 27-1106. 
(c)  Landscape area vegetation. All unpaved areas shall be covered by one of the following. 
(1)  Planting beds.

Sec. 27-1816. - Signage. 
    Refer to BMCC section 27-700 for sign requirements. The following additional requirements are specific to the EBURD and replaces information in the BMCC section 27-705. 
(a)  Intent. Commerce is the primary purpose, function and goal of the EBURD. It is the economic engine that funds the city and Yellowstone County. The functions of signs are to support and enhance that purpose. Regardless of other considerations, the ability of a business to thrive in any given location is the final measure of appropriateness. In a community of our size serving a broad market including Montana, Wyoming and parts of North Dakota, and in a time of growing online commerce, it is increasingly necessary that a business must be able to reach beyond the immediate neighborhood to survive. The ways traffic moves through districts is the most reliable indicator of sign needs and the assurance of success of this purpose. The Billings Industrial Revitalization District Inc. ("BIRD") is the organization that oversees the EBURD and makes recommendations to the city council. 
(b)  The following revises BMCC section 27-706 to incorporate the EBURD. 
(1)  Service station and convenience store signage shall adhere to the requirements of this section, BMCC subsections 27-1816(b) through (o). BMCC subsection 27-706(a) does not apply to the EBURD. 
(2)  Billboards shall be permitted only on boulevards or avenues within the EBURD (Montana Avenue, 1st Avenue N, 4th Avenue N, 6th Avenue N, and N 13th Street). All other requirements of BMCC subsection 27-706(b) shall apply, including the requirements of the existing moratorium. 
(3)  BMCC subsection 27-706(c), shopping center or mall signs does not apply to the EBURD. 
(4)  BMCC subsection 27-706(e), church, school, and other institutional use signs does not apply to the EBURD. Churches, schools, and other institutions shall adhere to the requirements of this section, BMCC subsections 27-1816(b) through (o). 
(5)  All signs that that predate the adoption of this code are legally non conforming until they are completely replaced. At that point, the standards contained within are applicable. 
(6)  Section 27-705 will be applicable for all boulevard street types.

b.  Address all features of the street right-of-way, including sidewalks, parkways, traffic lanes, bicycle lanes, and medians. 
c.  Continue the existing logical and comprehensible system of streets that result in a simple, consistent and understandable pattern of blocks and lots. 
d.  Provide adequate access to all lots for vehicles and pedestrians. 
e.  Create streets that are appropriate for their contexts in residential, commercial, or mixed use districts and are designed to encourage travel at appropriate volumes and speeds. 
(2)  Applicability. The standards in this section apply to all vehicular rights-of-way within the EBURD. 
(3)  General requirements. All proposed streets, landscape or furnishings zones, and sidewalks shall be located in dedicated vehicular rights-of-way as required by this article. 
a.  Street types. All new vehicular rights-of-way shall match one of the street types, refer to BMCC subsections 27-1817(g) through 27-1817(k), whether publicly dedicated or privately held. 
b.  Public use. All streets shall be available for public use at all times. Gated streets and streets posted as private are not permitted. 
(4)  Master plans. Refer to any adopted city master plans for additional information, such as the current bikeway and trail master plan. 
(5)  Street construction specifications. All construction in the right-of-way shall follow specifications defined by the department of public works, engineering division. 
(b)  General street type standards. 
(1)  Street types. Street types defined in this section outline acceptable street configurations. New streets should be designed using the principles and characteristics defined by each street type. The department of public works, engineering division, or the Montana Department of Transportation, as applicable (refer to Figure 27-1817(e)-2), may require additional right-of-way, pavement width, or additional street elements depending on specific site characteristics. 
(2)  Summary street type tables. Table 27-1817(f)-1 summarizes the requirements of each Street type. 
(3)  Graphics. The graphics provided, illustrating each street type, are samples of recommendations and illustrate only one (1) possible configuration of that street type. By applying the guidelines outlined and working with the department of public works, engineering division, other configurations can be determined acceptable. 
(4)  Typical street elements. Typical elements of a vehicular right-of-way are divided into the vehicular and pedestrian realm. Each street type detailed in this article outlines which facilities are applicable. Refer to Figure 27-1817(b)-1, Typical right-of-way elements. 

Figure 27-1817(b)-1: Typical Right-of-Way Elements. 
a.  Vehicular realm. The vehicular realm is comprised of the travel lanes, bicycle lanes, and parking lanes. 
b.  Pedestrian realm. The pedestrian realm is comprised of pedestrian facilities, such as sidewalk, path/trail, or off-street bicycle path. A buffer area that serves to buffer pedestrians or bicyclists from the movements of higher speed vehicles in the vehicular realm shall consist of one of the following: 
i.  Landscape zone. A landscape area between the back of curb to the sidewalk in which street trees, stormwater swales, lighting, and signage may be located. Typically used adjacent to residential ground floor uses. 
ii.  Furnishings zone. A hardscape area that extends from the sidewalk to the back of curb, in which street trees, street furniture, lighting, and signage may be located. Typically used adjacent to commercial or office ground floor uses. 
(5)  Bicycle facilities. The following types of bicycle accommodations are permitted in the vehicular realm. Refer to Figure 27-1817(b)-2. 
a.  Dedicated bicycle lane. Dedicated bicycle lanes are striped lanes on the outside of the outermost travel lanes that are designated for only bicycle use. This lane occurs on both sides of the street and shall be four (4) to five (5) feet wide. 
b.  Designated shared lane. A designated shared lane is a lane that is shared between vehicles and bicycles. This lane is typically wider than a standard vehicular lane, minimum thirteen (13) feet, in order to accommodate both types of users, and includes a painted bicycle marker combined with a double arrow (known as a "sharrow"). This improvement occurs on both directions. 
c.  Shared lane. A shared lane refers to a street that does not have bicycle lanes or a designated shared lane, but the speed and configuration of the street is such that bicycles could comfortably share lanes with traffic.

(8)  Street trees. Street trees are required along all street frontages, refer to BMCC subsection 27-1815(e). Street trees shall be located in either a landscape zone (within a planting bed or lawn) or a furnishings zone (in trees wells with grate as required), refer to BMCC subsection 27-1817(b)(4)b. 
(c)  General street layout requirements. The following standards apply to new streets or newly platted vehicular rights-of-way. 
(1)  Interconnected street pattern. The network of streets shall form an interconnected pattern with multiple intersections with the following features: 
a.  Street network. The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of existing streets from adjoining areas into new subdivisions or developments. 
b.  Block pattern. To the maximum extent possible, the existing block pattern shall be continued and reinforced, and the following encouraged: 
i.  Avoid the closure of existing streets so as to maintain the existing network. 
ii.  As railway tracks are abandoned or larger sites redevelop, new streets should be introduced to extend the existing pattern, incorporating the existing block sizes. 
c.  Bulb shaped cul-de-sac streets are not permitted. 
d.  New deadends should be avoided. 
(d)  Intersection design. The following section outlines the regulations for developing and reconstructing intersections. 
(1)  Applicability. The regulations outlined in this section shall apply to all planned intersections and may serve as guidance for reconfiguration of existing intersections. 
(2)  Curb radii. The following curb radii shall be utilized unless otherwise authorized by the department of public works, engineering division. 
a.  Intersections should be designed for actual turning radius of the typical design vehicle as opposed to the maximum design vehicle. Small curb radii at intersections shorten pedestrian crossing distances and reduce vehicle turning speeds, thereby balancing the ease of travel of the vehicles and pedestrians. Refer to Figure 27-1817(d)-1. 
b.  Alley, neighborhood, and connector streets. At the intersection of any street with an alley, neighborhood, or a connector street, the following curb radii shall be utilized. 
i.  With on-street parking on both streets and no bulb-out, a five-foot radius is required. 
ii.  Without on-street parking, a 15-foot radius is required. 

Figure 27-1817(d)-1. Actual Right Turn Radius with On-Street Parking. 
c.  Avenues and boulevards. At the intersection of avenues with either another avenue or a boulevard, the following curb radii shall be utilized. 
i.  With on-street parking on both streets and no bulb-out, a 12-foot radius is required. 
ii.  Without on-street parking on either streets, a 25-foot radius is required. 
d.  Larger radius. When the design vehicle requires a larger curb radius, a larger radius may be utilized with approval of the public works, engineering division. 
(4)  Crosswalks. Crosswalks shall be required at all intersections involving Montana Avenue, N 20th Street, and N 13th Street. 
a.  Dimensions. Crosswalks shall be minimum eight (8) feet in width, measured from mid-stripe to mid-stripe, per city standards. 
b.  Markings. Crosswalks shall be appropriately indicated on the finished street surface with painted markings and/or textured or colored pavement. 
c.  Crossing distances. To encourage pedestrian activity, typical crosswalks shall not extend over thirty-eight (38) feet without a landscape median, bulbouts, and/or other pedestrian refuge to mitigate the effects of vehicular traffic on crossing and increase pedestrian safety and comfort. 
d.  Bulb-outs. To shorten pedestrian crossing distances, bulb-outs should be utilized at all intersections, unless otherwise required by the department of public works or the Montana Department of Transportation as applicable (refer to Figure 27-1817(e)-2 for state maintained routes). 
i.  The depth of the bulb-out shall match the utilized on-street parking, either the width of the parallel space or the depth of the diagonal space. 
ii.  The radius of the bulb-out shall match the requirements for the intersection. Refer to BMCC subsection 27-1817(d). 
(5)  Accessible ramps and warning panels. Accessible ramps and warning panels, per the American Disabilities Act or any more stringent state requirement, are required where all sidewalks or trails terminate at a crosswalk or curb. 
a.  Ramp orientation. Ramps should be generally oriented perpendicular to traffic, requiring two (2) ramps per corner at intersecting streets. 
(e)  Maps of street types. Refer to the maps on the following pages. 
(1)  Street type map. Refer to Figure 27-1817(e)-1.

Sec. 28-712. - Administrative enforcement powers. 
    In addition to the other enforcement powers and remedies established by this chapter, any city enforcement agent has the authority to utilize the following administrative remedies. 
(1)  Cease and desist orders. When a city enforcement agent finds that a discharge has taken place or is likely to take place in violation of this chapter, the agent may issue an order to cease and desist such discharge, or practice, or operation likely to cause such discharge and direct that those persons not complying shall: 
a.  Comply with the requirement; 
b.  Comply with a time schedule for compliance, and/or 
c.  Take appropriate remedial or preventive action to prevent the violation from recurring. 
(2)  Notice to clean. Whenever a city enforcement agent finds any oil, earth dirt, grass, weeds, dead trees, tin cans, rubbish, refuse, waste or any other material of any kind, in or upon the sidewalk abutting or adjoining any parcel of land, or upon any parcel of land or grounds or in close proximity to any open drain or ditch channel, which may result in an increase in pollutants entering the storm drain or a non-stormwater discharge to the storm drain, he or she may give notice to remove and lawfully dispose of such material in any manner that he or she reasonably may provide. The recipient of such notice shall undertake the activities as described in the notice within the time frames set forth therein. In the event the owner or operator of a facility fails to conduct the activities as described in the notice, the city director of public works or designee may cause such required activities as described in the notice to be performed, and the cost thereof shall be assessed and invoiced to the owner of the property. If the invoice is not paid within sixty (60) calendar days, a lien shall be placed upon and against the property. 
(Ord. No. 10-5505, § 1, 3-22-10) 
Sec. 28-713. - Nonexclusivity of remedies. 
    Remedies under this chapter are in addition to and do not supersede or limit any and all other remedies, civil or criminal. The remedies provided for herein shall be cumulative and not exclusive. 
(Ord. No. 10-5505, § 1, 3-22-10) 
Sec. 28-714. - Appeal. 
    Any person notified of non-compliance with this chapter or required to perform monitoring, analyses, reporting and/or corrective action, who is aggrieved by the decision of the city enforcement agent, may appeal such decision in writing to the public works director within ten (10) business days following the effective date of the decision or written notice. Upon receipt of such request, the city administrator shall request a report and recommendation from the city enforcement agent and shall set the matter for administrative hearing at the earliest practical date. At said hearing, the city administrator may hear additional evidence, and may revoke, affirm or modify the city enforcement agent's decision. Such decision shall be final. 
(Ord. No. 10-5505, § 1, 3-22-10) 
Sec. 28-715. - Disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific, engineering and other relevant technical considerations. The standards set forth herein are minimum standards and this chapter does not imply that compliance will ensure that there will be no unauthorized discharge of pollutants into the waters of the United States. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any agent or employee thereof for any damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
