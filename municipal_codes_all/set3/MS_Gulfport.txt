PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Gulfport, Mississippi of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1963 Code, as supplemented through December 16, 1986, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1963 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 4 is numbered 4-1 and the third section of Chapter 6 is 6-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 6-1.1, 6-1.2 and 6-1.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 4 and 5, it will be designated as Chapter 4.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by government officers and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted-pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Editor's note- Certain historical documents are included in this part. Subsequent to the time of such documents, a charter for the city, not included herein, was approved in a city election on December 12, 1911, for a commission form of government. The governor approved the charter on January 16, 1912. Such charter was issued by the secretary of state of Mississippi pursuant to Chapter 108, Laws of Mississippi, 1908. At a special election held on January 29, 1985, the city adopted a mayor-council form of government in place of the mayor-commissioner form. Then, on July 1, 1985, the mayor-council form of government (Miss. Code Ann. 1972, Title 21, Chapter 8) became effective and replaced the city charter provisions.

The tax rate applicable to the land and the assessed value of the land for any individual year shall not be affected by the exemption of the increased value of improvements. No separately assessed personal properties or mobile units shall be included in the increased tax assessment qualifying for exemption under this division. 
(d)  Investment value required. Only new or renovated structures over fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) in aggregate improvements, not including personal furnishings or personal property, found to be aiding and implementing the promotion of business or commerce in the designated redevelopment district may qualify for an exemption under this division. 
(e)  Calculation of the abatement. Structures will be eligible based upon amounts approved by the governing authority for the city ad valorem exemption only up to percentages listed below: 
(1)  Structures only for commercial businesses. Up to ninety (90) percent; 
(2)  Structures only for retail businesses. Up to one hundred (100) percent; 
(3)  Structures only for residential use. Up to seventy (70) percent; 
(4)  Structures for mixed use. Figured on bottom floor use as a percentage of the bottom floor. For instance if sixty (60) percent of the bottom floor is used as retail and the balance is used as residential, then sixty (60) percent (percentage of the type used) × one hundred (100) percent (exemption for type) = sixty (60) percent of the total improvement plus forty (40) percent percentage of the type used) × seventy (70) percent (exemption for type) = twenty-eight (28) percent of the total improvement for a total of a potential eighty-eight (88) percent exemption. 
(f)  Limitations on exemptions. No exemption shall be granted except upon written application to the Gulfport Redevelopment Commission and then upon their written recommendation for such exemption to the governing authority that the construction, renovation, or improvement of the subject property meets the requirements set forth in this division. The governing authority of the city shall have the sole and final authority to determine the status of any exemption and to define the amount, if any, of the exemption. The decision of the governing authority shall be final in this matter and no appeal by the applicant will be allowed. 
(g)  Fees for application. Applications shall first be submitted to the Gulfport Redevelopment Commission for review. Payment of not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) may be charged by said commission to the property owner to cover the direct expenses incurred by the agency in review of the application.

The applicant must present evidence of being in receipt of a Mississippi state sales tax license number. The city tax collector shall furnish a copy of such license to the director of the department of public safety.

(f)  In the event the city shall choose to license the rental of recreational items as provided by subparagraph (c) above, or the sale of any merchandise as provided by subparagraph (d) above, any applicant for either of such licenses who has been approved as a licensee, but who considers the conditions attached to the issuance of his license to be so burdensome as to deprive him of the benefits of the license, may appeal to the city council for relief from the allegedly burdensome condition or requirement, which appeal shall be made in the manner set out below. 
(1)  Notice of any such appeal must be given within ten (10) days after the license containing the protested condition or requirement is offered the applicant. 
(2)  The only question to be presented or considered on the appeal is whether the protested condition or requirement attached to or contained in the proffered license is so restrictive and unreasonable as to constitute an interference with the free public use of the sand beach by all members of the general public in accordance with valid laws, ordinances and police regulations, within the meaning of paragraph III of the final judgment entered October 8, 1970, in federal civil action Number 2262. 
(3)  Notice of appeal shall be in writing and shall be delivered by registered or certified mail to the city clerk at city hall.

(4)  If the appeal shall be denied, the appellant may accept the proffered license by written acceptance and compliance with requirements within ten (10) days, lacking which the license shall become and be void and withdrawn. If the appeal shall be successful, in whole or in part, the city council will modify the license to conform to their decision and the appellant shall have ten (10) days to accept the modified license and comply with its requirements, failing in which the modified license shall become and be void and cancelled. 
(g)  No license, either rental or sales, shall authorize or permit boats or other watercraft, merchandise of any kind, or other sales or rental appurtenances or equipment, to remain on the beach after the date of termination of the license issued to any vendor or between the dates of November first of each year through March first of the next succeeding year, nor may any such objects be left unattended at any other time for a period exceeding three (3) days. The city council shall have the right to adjudicate that any such property left on the beach interferes with the public's use of the sand beach and the city's duty to maintain the sand beach, and shall enter on its minutes such a finding directing the beach maintenance crews to forthwith remove the same. Failure of the vendor to recover his goods within thirty (30) days after such removal, and to pay all cost and expense of removing and storing the articles, shall result in the vendor's license being immediately and automatically voided, and the property and vendor shall be subject to action for recovery of the cost and expense of seizure, removal and storage. 
(h)  Loud or unusual noises are recognized as having the potential of being injurious to the public health, safety, and welfare, and may be prohibited or regulated by the city. Loud or unusual noises are defined as sounds being plainly audible at a distance of one hundred (100) feet from the source of amplification, and may be regulated on the seawall structure itself, that portion of the seawall easement or right-of-way north of the seawall structure, and the sand beach.

Sec. 2-86. - Contract cancelled when craft sold, leased. 
    The sale, lease, or transfer of ownership of any vessel shall immediately cancel the vessel dockage agreement by which the rented slip has been assigned. If any of these events occur, it shall be necessary for the lessor or new owner of such vessel to establish a new vessel dockage agreement immediately after the event. If a "wait list" has been established for the slip in which the transferred vessel is berthed, the new owner may apply for a different slip (if one is available) or place his name on the "wait list". Under no circumstances may the lessor or new owner retain a "wait listed" slip or move ahead of those already on the wait list.

    Vessels that are of an unsightly appearance or in deteriorated condition or in an unseaworthy condition - based on the harbormaster's opinion and viewpoint - are prohibited from renting any slip space or tying up anywhere in the marina except temporarily at the fuel dock for the purpose of taking on fuel and supplies. If such a vessel is experiencing an emergency situation or cannot return to sea because of inclement weather, said vessel may be permitted temporary dockage only until the emergency or weather has abated. Vessels that have become dangerous or a nuisance may be deemed as a public nuisance. Owners of dangerous or public nuisance vessels (including sunken or partially sunken vessels) that remain berthed in the marina will be given notice by the harbormaster to require that the dangerous condition or nuisance be corrected and/or abated immediately. Failure of the owner to resolve the situation immediately, but no later than three (3) days from the date of the notice, will result in the city taking such steps as necessary to remove the danger or nuisance and to charge the vessel owner with any and all costs incurred by the city for doing so. If the danger or nuisance is so extreme in nature that it must be resolved without any delay whatsoever, the city, at the sole discretion of the harbormaster, shall have the power to take all action necessary and incidental to remove such danger and/or nuisance.

Sec. 2-109.1. - Slips, docking, power, and vessel safety. 
    All vessels berthed in a slip are expected, minimally, to utilize all four (4) tie points, i.e., two (2) stern lines and two (2) bow lines, one (1) of each on both the starboard side and port side of the vessel. Vessels tied side-to along a pier are to use a bow line, stern line, appropriate spring lines, and portable fenders to keep the vessel off the dock. Tie (dock) lines are to be of appropriate material, sufficient strength and diameter for the size and weight of the vessel being berthed using these guidelines as the minimum expected by the Marina: 
Vessels under 20' are to use at least 3/8" line. 
Vessels 20' to 30' are to use at least 1/2" line. 
Vessels 30' to 40' are to use at least 5/8" line. 
Vessels 40' to 60' are to use at least 3/4" line. 
Vessels over 60' are to use at least 1" line.

Power cords must be certified marine grade and must be in water-tight, factory condition, i.e., power cords may not be repaired or retro-fitted in any manner except the replacement of the ends with marine-approved equipment so designed for the repair. Power cords must be of sufficient length to permit slack at all times between the vessel and power pedestal and they are to be secured in a manner that will prevent them from hanging in the water or pulling on the power pedestal's outlet. Adaptors intended to change the configuration of the power pedestal's outlet type may not be utilized and household extension cords - regardless of rating - are strictly prohibited outside the confines of the vessel. Power pedestals are to remain unlocked at all times. The harbormaster and the marina staff shall retain the right to board any vessel at any time, with or without marina tenant permission, for the purpose of ensuring ensure vessel safety, marina safety, safety to others, and for due diligence when any abnormality, no matter its origin, is directly observed or reported as such by others.

A copy of the contractor's valid and current certificate of insurance must be on file in the marina office before the work is commenced. Additionally, contractors must sign in with the marina office before proceeding beyond the gates and walls of the marina to perform their services and must sign-out upon completion. The types of individuals to whom this section applies would be mechanics, divers, detailers, yacht brokers, surveyors, sail makers, upholsters, painters, finishers, woodworkers, and anyone else who performs any kind of work-for-hire on a vessel in the marina. 
( Ord. No. 2857, § 2(Exh. A), 6-7-16 ) 
Sec. 2-109.4. - Vessel registration and/or documentation. 
    To verify current and ongoing ownership of the vessel identified on the vessel dockage agreement, all marina tenants must provide the marina office with a copy of their current State of Mississippi Vessel Registration and/or a copy of their current U.S. Coast Guard documentation.

( Ord. No. 2857, § 2(Exh. A), 6-7-16 ) 
Sec. 2-109.5. - Slip wait lists for tenants and non-tenants. 
    A non-tenant wait list, (only established for a full marina), is intended to provide non-tenant boaters with a high degree of certainty that a slip will become available for them when a vacancy occurs at some unknown point in the future. Individuals on the non-tenant wait list must make their decision within three (3) days of being contacted by the marina office. The marina tenant wait list is intended to provide those internal marina tenants who desire a different slip the opportunity to move when a vacancy occurs. Marina tenants will have first right of refusal over non-tenant boaters for a vacant slip and their decision to transfer slips must be made within three (3) days of being contacted by the marina office. 
( Ord. No. 2857, § 2(Exh. A), 6-7-16 ) 
Sec. 2-109.6. - Monthly, semi-annual, and annual payments, billing. 
    Initial monthly slip rent payments, sufficient to cover a minimum one-month (thirty (30) days) period of rent, are due and payable on the day the vessel dockage agreement is signed. Slip rent and fees will be applied on a prorated basis for the remaining days in the month the vessel dockage agreement was signed, and any credit remaining will be applied on the first day of the following month. Marina tenants who pay their rent on a monthly basis will not be billed or reminded, by mail or otherwise, and it is incumbent upon the marina tenant to ensure payment is made on or before the first day of each month but no later than midnight on the 14 th day of the month. Marina tenants who pay their rent on a semi-annual or annual basis will be notified once by mail in the month prior to their payment coming due. Any payments received after the 14 th of the month will be considered late and become subject to charges outlined in section 2-84 of this article.

Parking is never permitted in the staging area. Parking for vehicles and connected boat trailers is allowed only in the posted and designated lot or lots. Vehicles without a trailer connected may not park in the designated boat trailer parking area nor may a trailer be parked without its tow vehicle attached. Except as may be allowed for events sanctioned by the city, parking of any individual vehicles, vehicles with trailers, or trailers of any sort, including towable bar-b-que trailers, is absolutely prohibited anywhere inside the curbline of Jones Park including any of the green space and/or on any sidewalks therein.

All domesticated animal waste must be policed and disposed of by the animal owner. At no time may domesticated animal waste be washed or thrown overboard into the waters of the marina or the Mississippi Sound. 
( Ord. No. 2857, § 2(Exh. A), 6-7-16 ) 
Sec. 2-109.9. - Severe weather and hurricane plan. 
    Because severe weather may occur at any time, marina tenants must ensure their vessel is always appropriately prepared and secured to handle the potential onslaught of high winds, high tides, heavy rains, or all three (3) at once. In the event of an approaching tropical system, marina tenants are reminded to monitor the National Weather Service and make prudent decisions regarding the evacuation of their boat from the marina. In the event a tropical system is forecast to raise the seawater level in the marina by at least four (4) feet, and/or based on other advice from Harrison County Emergency Operation Center, the harbormaster may order that all marina tenants evacuate the marina and seek safer dockage for their vessels. This order shall be prominently posted and updated on the city's web page at www.gulfport-ms.gov and the marina's web page at www.gulfportmarina.com. Marina tenants who fail to abide by any duly issued order to remove their vessel from the marina will assume any and all liability and responsibility for said vessel and any damage it receives or any damage it may cause to city property or other vessels as a result of the storm's impact on the marina, and may be denied any future dockage privileges in the marina. Further, marina tenants who fail to abide by any order to remove their vessel from the marina (i.e., a mandatory evacuation of the marina), shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Each day or part thereof that a vessel remains at the marina after the evacuation deadline established in the evacuation order and before the order is lifted shall constitute a separate offense. 
( Ord. No. 2857, § 2(Exh. A), 6-7-16 ; Ord. No. 2924, § 2, 11-7-17 ) 
Sec. 2-109.10. - Designation of slip sizes. 
    All slips in the marina are pre-designated in size and include adequate buffer zones, both fore and aft, to accommodate vessel movement within the slip. Except along the marina walls, and/or at the harbormaster's discretion, no vessel may at any time exceed the maximum designation for a particular slip. No vessels, or any part thereof, may at any time extend beyond the end tie-piles into the fairway. Slip assignments are based on the actual physically measured length of a vessel from the further point forward to the furthest point aft, including bowsprits, bow pulpits, swim platforms, dingys and/or dingy davits. 
DESIGNATED MAXIMUM OF VESSEL'S MEASURED LENGTH 
A Slip - restricted to vessels greater than 64' but smaller than 95' 
B Slip - restricted to vessels no greater than 64' 
C Slip - restricted to vessels no greater than 56' 
D Slip - restricted to vessels no greater than 46' 
E Slip - restricted to vessels no greater than 36' 
F Slip - restricted to vessels no greater than 30' 
G Slip - restricted to vessels no greater than 24' 
H Slip - restricted to vessels no greater than 19' 
Vessels will be assigned, by the harbormaster, only to a slip in which the vessel's measured length does not exceed the designated maximum for the slip. Vessel owners who desire and elect to berth their vessels in a larger slip than designated will be charged for the size of the slip instead of the LOA of their vessel. Except with harbormaster approval, no vessel may at any time be berthed in a slip that is designated as too small for the vessel LOA. 
( Ord. No. 2857, § 2(Exh. A), 6-7-16 ) 
Sec. 2-109.11. - Movement of vessels to accommodate boat shows. 
    From time to time, the city may host various boat shows which may necessitate the temporary relocation of vessels from their designated slips into slips or other areas that are outside the limits of the show. When events of this nature occur: 
(1)  Marina tenants will be notified by the marina at least thirty (30) days in advance if they will be required to move their vessels. 
(2)  Marina tenants are expected to move their vessel into the designated temporary slip no earlier than fourteen (14) days and no later than seven (7) days before the event opens to the public. 
(3)  Vessels that are not moved by the marina tenant within seven (7) days before the event opens shall be moved to their temporary slip by the marina staff. 
(4)  No earlier than three (3) days, but no later than seven (7) days, after the conclusion of the boat show, marina tenants shall move their vessels back to their original slip. 
(5)  Vessels that are not returned to their contracted slip by the marina tenant within seven (7) days of the event may be moved back to their contracted slip by the marina staff.

(1)  Commercial establishments exist, or may exist, within the City of Gulfport where books, magazines, periodicals, or other printed materials, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, video tapes, slides, or other visual representations or recordings, or other audio matters, or instruments, novelties, devices or paraphernalia which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to "specified sexual activities" or "specified anatomical areas," are possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed, and/or sold.

(3)  The sexually oriented activities referred to in (1) and (2) above often occur in establishments concurrent with the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages, which tend to further increase criminal activity, disrupt the peace and order of the community, affect the quality of life of the community, result in the moral degradation of the community; and the exploitation of such sexually oriented activities induces persons to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages, and in some cases intolerable amounts thereof. 
(4)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, property values, community moral standards, and the general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the city, it is advisable for the city to regulate the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages at establishments where the activities referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection occur.

(6)  The state's and city's power to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, light wine and beer in commercial establishments under the Twenty-First Amendment overrides and is unrelated to any activities or communicative value that may attach to the activities referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection.

(h)  Effect on existing nonconforming commercial establishments. One or more commercial establishments featuring adult entertainment may be operating in the city on the effective date hereof in a manner that does not conform to the requirements for legal operation when applying this section.

This provision shall not be a defense or an excuse for any act or omission by any person that is or shall be charged with violation of any other laws or ordinances. Further, the extension of time to conform provided by this subsection shall not apply to any commercial establishment where such beverages are sold or consumed and where at the time of passage hereof said establishment acts or omissions of a nonconforming nature were not regularly being performed.

The telecommunications provider shall notify the engineering department in writing two (2) business days prior to commencing work as to the time and place that it shall commence work according to approved plans. Failure to give such advance notification, or to obtain a waiver of notice from the engineering department shall be grounds for the City of Gulfport to stop work, and/or to suspend or revoke permit approval. Any subsequent work permitted under this section, excluding maintenance, repairs or replacement work exempted under subsection (a) above in city or public rights-of-way or property shall require the aforesaid two (2) business days advance notice.

(Ord. No. 2204, § II, 11-16-99) 
Sec. 5-318. - Obligations and default.

The indemnity hereby required does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the municipality, its officers, employees, or subcontractors. Where comparative negligence is adjudicated, damages shall be apportioned according to the laws of the State of Mississippi. The city does not by this article waive any statutory or common law immunity.

Secs. 5-319-5-329. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE XIV. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES 
DIVISION 1. - PURPOSE, INTENT AND FINDINGS 

Sec. 5-330. - Purpose and intent. 
(1)  In the development and adoption of the ordinance codified in this article, it is recognized that there are some adult business uses which have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when located in close proximity to residential neighborhoods, public parks, churches, public buildings, schools and other such similar facilities, thereby having a deleterious impact upon the public health, safety and welfare, and that such businesses frequently become places of criminality. 
(2)  It has been acknowledged by communities across the nation that state and local governmental entities have a special concern in regulating the operation of such businesses under their jurisdiction to ensure those controls and regulations necessary to preserve the integrity and character of residential neighborhoods, the stability of property values, and impose restrictions and regulations upon those activities that would adversely affect property values, increase crime and violence, and prevent adverse secondary effects that will contribute to the blighting or down grading of adjacent neighborhoods. It is the secondary effects that will contribute to the blighting or downgrading of adjacent neighborhoods. It is the further purpose of this article to protect the well-being of the youth of the community from objectionable operational characteristics of these adult uses by regulating and restricting their close proximity to established certain facilities such as, without limitation, churches, parks, schools and residential areas. 
(3)  In recognition of the protections affording to the citizens under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, it is not the intent of this article to inhibit freedom of speech or the press. It is further the belief that just as advertising is designed to stimulate one's appetite for desiring goods or services, an overabundance or preoccupation with sexual displays or materials arouses the appetites of those so preoccupied and encourages violations of the criminal statutes involving sexual offenses and is contrary to the health and safety of the community. 
(4)  The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. This article represents a balancing of the legitimate ends of the community by imposing an incidental, content-neutral place, time and manner regulation of adult entertainment businesses, without limiting alternative avenues of communication. The regulations deemed necessary to control the undesirable externalities arising from these enterprises are set forth in this article. 
(5)  Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.

(1)  Adult entertainment businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where adult entertainment businesses are located. 
(3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at adult entertainment businesses, especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
(4)  Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. 
(5)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other adult entertainment businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such adult entertainment businesses. 
(6)  At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in adult entertainment businesses including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections. 
(7)  As of 2007, the total number of reported cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was one million, eighteen thousand, four hundred twenty-eight (1,018,428). 
(8)  In the year of 2007 there were three hundred fifty-two (352) reported new cases of AIDS and HIV infected individuals in the state. 
(9)  The total number of cases of genital chlamydia trachomatis infections in the United States reported in 1997 was five hundred twenty-six thousand, six hundred fifty-three (526,653), an eight (8) percent increase over the year 1996. 
(10)  The total number of cases of early (less than one (1) year) syphilis in the United States reported during the twelve-year period 1985-1997 was three hundred eighty-seven thousand, two hundred thirty-three (387,233). 
(11)  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with a total of one million, nine hundred one thousand, three hundred sixty-five (1,901,365) cases reported during the period 1993-1997. 
(12)  The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
(13)  According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
(14)  Sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(15)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids, including semen and urine, are found in the areas of adult entertainment businesses where persons view "adult"-oriented films. 
(16)  Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity. 
(17)  Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug dealing and drug use. 
(18)  The findings noted in paragraphs numbered (1) through (17) raise substantial governmental concerns and requires immediate attention to protect the public health and safety. 
(19)  Adult entertainment businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(20)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of adult entertainment businesses. Further, such licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that the adult entertainment business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult entertainment business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(21)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments. 
(22)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the adult entertainment business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity. 
(23)  It is desirable, in the prevention of crime and the spread of communicable diseases, to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this article is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
(24)  The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment business license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this article. 
(25)  The barring of such individuals from operation or employment in adult entertainment businesses for a period of five (5) years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to further criminal conduct, and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(26)  The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by enactment of this article.

ARTICLE XV. - REHABILITATION HEALTH CLINICS AND PLASMA CENTERS 
DIVISION 1. - PURPOSE, INTENT AND FINDINGS 

Sec. 5-430. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  In the development and adoption of this article, it is recognized that rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers, as such terms are defined herein, can and do have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when located in close proximity to residential neighborhoods, public parks, churches, public buildings, schools and other such similar facilities, thereby having a deleterious impact upon the public health, safety and welfare, and that such businesses frequently become places of criminality and bring crime to an area. 
(b)  It has been acknowledged by communities across the nation that state and local governmental entities have a special concern in regulating the operation of such businesses under their jurisdiction to ensure those controls and regulations necessary to preserve the integrity and character of residential neighborhoods, the stability of property values, and impose restrictions and regulations upon those activities that would adversely affect property values, increase crime and violence, and prevent adverse secondary effects that will contribute to the blighting or down grading of adjacent neighborhoods. It is the secondary effects that will contribute to the blighting or down grading of adjacent neighborhoods. It is the further purpose of this article to protect the well-being of the citizens of the community from objectionable operational characteristics of these clinics by regulating and restricting their close proximity to established certain facilities such as, without limitation, churches, parks, schools and residential areas. 
(c)  It is not the intent of this article to inhibit the operation of these clinics or to inhibit the availability of opiod medication to those to whom it is legally prescribed or to inhibit the ability of persons to sell plasma legally. 
(d)  The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the ability of one who has been legally prescribed opiod medication to obtain those medications or the ability of one who desires to sell his/her plasma. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access to opiod medication by those for whom opiod medication has been prescribed or to restrict or deny access to a location where plasma may be sold legally. This article represents a balancing of the legitimate ends of the community by imposing an incidental, content-neutral place, time and manner regulation of rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers. The regulations deemed necessary to control the undesirable externalities arising from these businesses are set forth in this article. 
(e)  Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution, sale or consumption of opiod medications illegally. 
( Ord. No. 2904, § A(Exh. A), 5-23-17 ) 
Sec. 5-431. - Findings. 
    Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers (as such terms are defined herein) on the community in reports made available to the city's governing authorities, the city's governing authorities (mayor and city council) make and identify the following non-exhaustive findings: 
(1)  Rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers (hereinafter, clinics and centers) lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activity that are presently uncontrolled or uncontrollable by the operators of the clinics and centers. 
(2)  Anecdotal evidence demonstrates that criminal activity occurs with more frequency in neighborhoods where clinics and centers are located, including petit larcenies, vehicular burglaries, attempted burglaries, theft, intimidation, trespassing, vandalism, sale or purchase of illicit substances and/or methadone. 
(3)  Illicit exchange of methadone for money on clinic property is disturbing and illegal and not something that the city welcomes in its residential neighborhoods or commercial areas. 
(4)  Use of funds derived from sale of plasma at centers for the purchase of illegal drugs is disturbing and not something that the city welcomes in its neighborhoods or commercial areas. 
(5)  Public urination and public defecation (ie, lewd conduct) by clients of the clinics are reported and witnessed on clinics grounds and on property owned by others and such diminishes the quality of life in or around residential or commercial neighborhoods. 
(6)  Erratic driving and driving at high rates of speed have been witnessed and reported in areas around clinics and such is not conducive to residential or commercial neighborhoods. 
(7)  Patrons of clinics are known to arrive early, sometimes hours before the clinic opens, and to loiter in the parking lots of the clinics for hours; clinics attract a large number of patrons on any given day which greatly increases traffic in the area of the clinic. 
(8)  Patrons of centers are known to depart the centers and immediately utilize the funds obtained to procure illicit drugs at nearby facilities or business entities. 
(9)  Erratic behavior by patrons of clinics has been demonstrated to be of concern to neighboring property owners. 
(10)  The findings noted in paragraphs numbered (1) through (9) raise substantial governmental concerns and require immediate attention to protect the public health and safety. 
(11)  Rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(12)  A reasonable zoning and other regulations are appropriate mechanisms to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers. Further, such regulations will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that the rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. 
(13)  Placing rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers in areas of the city which are removed, generally, from residential and commercial areas will enhance the city's ability to protect the public health and safety and to allow these businesses to operate in a manner that least restricts their ability to accomplish their commercial goals. 
(14)  The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by enactment of this article.

(4)  The officer or other duly authorized person who issued the parking citation shall not be required to appear at the hearing unless the person charged with a violation herein has denied that the offense occurred by his commission and the Gulfport Municipal Court judge determines that the officer's or duly authorized person's presence is required.

This exemption from fees provided herein does not exempt such person, agency, or entity from compliance with all other provisions of this Ordinance (§ 7-250, et seq.) unless expressly exempted by federal or state law. 
(4)  Limited application of fees; Agreement to enter into franchise agreement. 
(a)  Agreement to enter into franchise agreement . A permit applicant, prior to being issued a permit, (referred to as "applicant" in this paragraph (4)) may enter into a written agreement with the city to negotiate and enter into a franchise agreement (referred to as an "agreement to enter" in this ordinance). The term of such an agreement to enter shall not exceed six (6) months from the date of execution thereof. Following approval by the city attorney and city council, the agreement to enter shall be effective upon the last date of approval or signature on behalf of the city by the mayor or his or her designee and by a proper and authorized representative of the applicant. 
(b)  Effect of agreement to enter. Execution of an "agreement to enter" with the city herein shall serve as the existence of a good faith effort on the part of the applicant to execute a franchise agreement within the six (6) month term thereof. If no franchise agreement is entered into between the applicant and city within the said six (6) month term, the applicant shall not be entitled to operate or conduct any commercial or business venture, enterprise, purpose, or use within, on, over, or under the public areas or ways , streets, property, or rights-of-way that were within the scope of any application(s) issued under this Ordinance unless otherwise specifically exempted under this Ordinance or a party to a valid and then current and effective franchise agreement. 
(c)  Limited application of certain trenching permit fee(s) toward qualifying franchise fee(s). If an agreement to enter has been timely and properly executed by the applicant and city, the applicant may request that any fees it previously paid to the city in connection with one (1) or more permits under this Ordinance (§ 7-250, et seq.) and which the city actually received and deposited, be applied toward whatever fee the applicant owes or may owe the city under its franchise agreement with the city that was executed in conjunction with its Agreement to Enter. The applicant must submit a written request to the city engineer for application of such permit fee(s) toward monies owed to the city under the applicable franchise agreement. Such a request for application of permit fees must be received by the city engineer or his or her designee within 365 consecutive calendar days of the effective date of the Agreement to Enter, with the first day of such time period to commence on the day following receipt by the city representative. If the last day of this period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or municipal holiday, the deadline shall extend to the next consecutive day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or municipal holiday. Application of permit fee(s) does not entitle the applicant or anyone else to any monetary value or consideration. If the amount of permit fee(s) exceeds the amount of franchise fee(s) owed to the city during this 365-day period, the city shall be entitled to keep possession and ownership of whatever amount(s) of permit fee(s) exceeds the amount(s) of franchise fee(s) paid by applicant to the city and received by the city during this 365-day period. If the amount of permit fee(s) is less than the amount of franchise fee(s) owed to the city during this 365-day period, the applicant shall still be obligated under its franchise agreement to pay whatever fees are owed the city thereunder after application of the permit fee(s) for that time period. As long as a franchise fee is then owed to the city, and a request for application is timely and properly made, the city shall make application thereof. However, the city shall apply such permit fee(s) toward franchise fee(s) at a time left to the discretion of the city governing authority or its designee, but at no time later than one hundred (100) days following the city's receipt of the applicant's request for application or the city's receipt of the applicable franchise fee(s), whatever is later. Permit fees may only be applied to franchise fees owed to the city by the same applicant or its subsidiary or parent company. 
(5)  Waivers . In the interest of public convenience and the conservation of public monies and resources, the city, by and through the city engineer or his or her designee, may waive any or all permit fees for work performed by a governmental agency, whether this work is performed by employees of the governmental agency or by a private firm or corporation under contract with the governmental agency. However, such governmental agency or private firm or corporation under contract therewith shall not be relieved of the responsibilities for obtaining a permit for work covered in this Ordinance as well as complying with all other provisions herein not in conflict with state or federal law. For purposes of this Paragraph only, "governmental agency" shall include the city.

Exceptions to those provisions may be granted by the city engineer or his or her designee when unusual circumstances are demonstrated. Failure to comply with any conditions relating to issuance of a permit shall be cause for revocation of such permit and shall constitute a violation of this article. The city reserves the right to make emergency repairs if deemed required for public safety. The cost of those repairs shall be borne by the permit holder and will be taken from the performance bond if not paid. 
(2)  All work performed under a permit issued hereunder shall be in conformance with all applicable and current codes, regulations, and laws and the permittee is responsible for all work performed pursuant to the permit, regardless of who performs the work.

No opening or excavation off a cross trench shall extend beyond the centerline of the road before being backfilled, compacted and the surface of the roadway temporarily restored. All trenches will be backfilled in six-inch lifts and compacted with vibratory mechanical compaction. No excavation shall take place unless the mechanical vibratory compactor is actually on the site. All utility facilities shall be located sufficiently ahead of trench excavation work to avoid damage of those facilities and to permit their relocation, if necessary. Storm drains, pipe culverts or other facilities encountered shall be adequately protected by the permittee. If the work performed interferes with the established drainage system of any street, road, or alley, adequate provision shall be made by the permittee to provide proper drainage during construction and to restore the existing system, all to the satisfaction of the city engineer or his or her designee. No dewatering equipment, wells, points, or piping shall occupy the traveled portion of roadways unless specifically approved and adequately protected to the satisfaction of the city engineer or his or her designee. Effluent from dewatering systems shall be discharged in such a manner that erodible soils are not adversely affected. All silt sediments being carried in the dewatering effluent must be intercepted prior to effluent discharge into any drainage system through use of a sedimentation basin designed to allow retention of discharge for sufficient time to render such waters free of suspended silt and sediments. The use of screening devices in lieu of sedimentation basin must receive specific approval from the city engineer or his or her designee and be employed only for minor flows. Any gravel, earth or other excavated material which is caused to roll, flow, or wash upon any road shall be removed from the roadway after deposit and such removal shall not occur more than twenty-four (24) hours therefrom. In the event the earth, gravel or other excavated material so deposited is not removed, the city or another on behalf of the city may remove the material and any and all costs incurred shall be paid by the permittee or applied from his or her bond. The permittee shall employ construction methods and rests that will keep flying dust to the minimum to the satisfaction of the city engineer or his or her designee. At the first sign of precipitation, all work on the shoulders and traveled way of streets and alleys shall stop and they shall be cleared of all dirt, gravel, and loose materials and the area backfilled until the weather permits resumption of work. 
(2)  Backfilling. Before backfilling of any cuts, trenches, or openings in streets, roads, or rights-of-way, the permittee shall request an inspection by the city engineer or his or her designee. All backfill material will be free from cinders, ashes, refuse, vegetable or organic matter, boulders, rocks or stones, wet material, or other materials which renders same unsuitable to obtain a firm and compact cover for the installed pipe. The backfill shall be placed in layers not to exceed six (6) inches and each layer shall be thoroughly compacted to not less than ninety-five (95) percent of the maximum dry density as defined by a Standard Proctor Test. Flowable fill will be substituted for compacted back-fill when directed by the city engineer or his or her designee. A Standard Proctor Test (ASTM D698) shall be conducted by an independent soil testing firm and the results given to the city engineer or his or her designee. The cost of this test shall be borne by the permittee or the person, firm, or corporation doing the backfill.

Notices of the hearing shall be sent to the petitioner(s) and the owners including tenants (if possible) of all properties within the subdivision block and adjacent property owners within one hundred sixty (160) feet of the subject property fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing by certified mail. At the discretion of the planning division administrator, additional notices may be sent to property owners/tenants of the affected neighborhood. 
(b)  Sketch plan. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of the sketch plan is to develop a general design on which to base the general subdivision plan, and thus to avoid having to revise such design to make it conform to the master plan and to relate it to surrounding development. To this end, the subdivider should consult informally with the planning commission's technical staff on preparation of the sketch plan. 
(2)  Submission and review. Prior to the filing of an application for tentative approval of the general subdivision plan, the subdivider shall submit to the planning commission two (2) copies of the sketch plan of the proposed subdivision, together with the attendant items required herein. This step does not require formal application, fee or filing of the subdivision plat with the planning commission. The sketch plan shall be reviewed by the planning commission or by the planning director. The review shall take into consideration, in addition to the requirements set out in these regulations, the components of the master plan, especially the plan for circulation (major street plan) and the plan for community facilities, the zoning ordinance and other plans, programs and regulations that might affect the area and the design and development of the subdivision. 
(3)  Action on sketch plan. Within fifteen (15) days, the planning commission or the planning director shall inform the subdivider that the sketch plan as submitted or as modified does or does not meet the objectives of the regulations in this article. When the planning commission or the planning director finds that the sketch plan does not meet the objectives of these regulations, the reasons therefor shall be given, together with any changes recommended to be made. In the event the subdivider does not agree to changes recommended by the planning director, he may request and shall receive review and formal action by the planning commission at its next regular meeting. 
(c)  General subdivision plan. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of the general subdivision plan, together with the attendant items required herein, is to provide plans for the construction of the subdivision and its improvements. To this end, during the preparation of the general subdivision plan the subdivider should consult with the planning commission's technical staff, with the city engineer, and with other officials and agencies concerned with the subdivision and the improvements. The general subdivision plan shall be based upon the general design shown on the sketch plan, together with the recommended changes. 
(2)  Submission and review. The subdivider shall submit to the planning commission four (4) copies of the general subdivision plan, together with the attendant items required herein, with written application for tentative approval at least seven (7) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. This step shall constitute formal application for approval and filing of the subdivision plat with the planning commission. The general subdivision plan, together with the attendant items required herein, shall be reviewed by the planning commission and will be referred for review and report to the city engineer, the county health officer, the director of public works, the utility agencies or companies with the tract or adjacent tracts, and other appropriate officials. The review shall take into consideration, in addition to the plans and other factors considered in connection with the sketch plan, the particular requirements and conditions affecting installation of improvements. 
(3)  Action on general subdivision plan. Notice of the time and place at which a general subdivision plan will be considered shall be sent by the planning commission to the subdivider and to the person whose name and address appears upon the plan as the owner of the land. At the regular monthly meeting next following the submission of a general subdivision plan, but in any event within forty-five (45) days, the planning commission shall act upon the general subdivision plan and shall communicate in writing to the subdivider its tentative approval or disapproval. In the case of tentative approval, the planning commission shall state: 
a.  The specific changes required to be made in the general subdivision plan. 
b.  The character and extent of the required improvements. 
c.  The amount of the surety bond which will be required in lieu of the completion of improvements required herein. 
In the case of disapproval, the planning commission shall state the ground of disapproval. 
(4)  Effect of approval. Tentative approval of a general subdivision plan shall not constitute acceptance of the plat of the proposed subdivision but shall be deemed only as an expression of approval of the plan submitted as a guide to preparation of the final plat. Tentative approval of a general subdivision plan shall be effective for a maximum period of one (1) year unless, upon application by the subdivider, the planning commission grants an extension. If the final plat has not been submitted to the planning commission within this time limit, the general subdivision plan shall again be submitted for tentative approval. 
(d)  Final plat. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of the final plat, together with the attendant items required herein, is to provide an accurate record of street and property lines and other elements being established on the land and the conditions of their use. The final plat shall be based upon the general subdivision plan, together with the required changes, but it may include only the portion of the approved general subdivision plan which the subdivider proposes to record and develop at the time, provided, however, that such portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations. 
(2)  Submission and review. The subdivider shall submit to the planning commission four (4) copies of the final plat, together with the attendant items required herein, with written application for final approval at least seven (7) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. The final plat, together with the attendant items required herein, shall be reviewed by the planning commission and will be referred for review and report to the city engineer, the county health officer, the director of public works, the utility agencies or companies concerned with the tract or adjacent tracts, and other appropriate officials. The review shall take into consideration conformance to the approved general subdivision plan and fulfillment of any conditions of such approval and the proper installation of required improvements in conformance with the requirements of these regulations and other applicable standards and regulations. 
(3)  Action on final plat. Before acting on the final plat, the planning commission shall give notice by registered mail to the subdivider and owner of the land, whose name and address is shown on the plat, of the time and place of the hearing to be held on the plat, at least five (5) days before the date fixed for such hearing. Similar notices shall be mailed to the owners of land immediately adjoining the platted land, as their names appear on the county assessment rolls. The planning commission shall act upon the final plat within forty-five (45) days after its submission and shall communicate in writing its recommendation for approval or disapproval to the mayor and city council and to the subdivider. In the case of disapproval, the planning commission shall state the ground of disapproval. 
    Upon receiving the recommendation of the planning commission, the mayor and city council shall approve or disapprove the final plat. In the case of approval, the mayor and city council shall enter such approval upon the final plat by the appropriate certificate. 
(4)  Effect of approval. Approval of a final plat by the mayor and city council shall be null and void if the final plat is not recorded in the records of the county chancery clerk within ninety (90) days after the date of approval unless, upon application by the subdivider, the mayor and city council grant an extension. Approval of a final plat shall not constitute acceptance by the public of the dedication of a street or other public way, park or space. 
(e)  Special provisions. 
(1)  Purpose. If the city planning commission chairman and the director of the city planning commission jointly determine that it would be in the best interest of the city, they may, at their sole discretion, authorize the following procedure when application is made for the division of a lot, tract or parcel of land into two (2) or more lots, plats, sites or other division for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or building development. 
(2)  Procedures. The owner shall file with the city planning commission a survey of the entire tract of land which shall clearly set forth the proposed division of property. The city planning commission chairman and director shall review the survey to determine the following: 
a.  That each new lot created would be in compliance with appropriate zoning ordinances, building codes and restrictive covenants, if any. 
b.  That the proposed division would not deny any lot direct access to a dedicated public street. 
(3)  Approval. Upon approval by the city planning commission chairman and director, the original deed or other conveyance of the property so divided shall have affixed thereto, as exhibits, a copy of the survey and the certificate signed by the city planning commission chairman and director approving the division of the property. Thereafter, the deed or other conveyance, with exhibits, shall be recorded in the land deed records of the Chancery Clerk of the First Judicial District of Harrison County, Mississippi. 
(4)  Disapproval. If the planning commission chairman and the planning commission director cannot agree to authorize a subdivision by this procedure, then the subdivision is disapproved. The applicant may then proceed to make application to the planning commission for consideration under the normal subdivision procedure. 
(5)  Public hearing and notification. Within thirty (30) days of filing a request to subdivide property by this procedure the planning commission chairman and director shall notify the applicant in writing of their decision. Notification of adjacent property owners and a public hearing area not required when this subdivision procedure is used.

Sec. 9-50. - Design standards. 
(A)  Principles of acceptability. 
(1)  Conformance to master plan. In general, the subdivision shall conform to the master plan for the city and to the zoning ordinance, and other applicable ordinances or regulations. If a suggested plan for the neighborhood in which the land to be subdivided is located has been made by the planning commission, the layout of the subdivision shall be in general conformance thereto. 
(2)  Provision for future subdivision. If a tract is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged to allow the opening of future streets and logical further subdivision. 
(3)  Land subject to flooding. Land subject to periodic flooding and land deemed by the planning commission to be uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy nor for any use that may increase danger to health, life or property or aggravate the flood hazard, but such land within the tract to be subdivided shall be set aside for such uses as shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or shall not produce unsatisfactory or insanitary or unhealthful living conditions. If the land to be subdivided is located in an area having poor drainage or other physical impairment, the planning commission may approve the subdivision, provided the subdivider agrees to make such improvements as are necessary to render the area substantially safe for residential use, or, in lieu of the improvements, shall furnish a surety bond or a certified check covering the cost of the required improvements, as provided herein. 
(4)  Natural features. Natural scenic features of the land, such as bayous, shall be considered to be community assets, and the design of the subdivision shall protect and utilize such natural scenic features. 
(5)  Trees. Because of their value in soil conservation, health and community appearance, large trees shall be preserved wherever possible. Street trees placed within the public right-of-way shall not be of a low, bushy species that might obstruct vision. No trees shall be planted within twenty-five (25) feet of the intersecting property lines at a street intersection. 
(6)  Reserve strips. There shall be no reserve strips controlling land dedicated or intended to be dedicated to street or other public use except where their control is placed in the appropriate governing body under conditions approved by the planning commission. 
(7)  Buffer park strips. Where a residential subdivision adjoins land zoned for or used for a railroad right-of-way, an industrial area, a commercial area or other land use which would have a depreciating effect on the residential use of the land, a buffer park strip may be required by the planning commission. 
(8)  Names. The name of the subdivision and new street names shall not duplicate nor closely approximate phonetically the name of any other subdivision or street in the county. Street names shall be subject to approval of the planning commission. In general, the use of names associated with the history and development of the city and the gulf coast is desirable. 
(B)  Streets. 
(1)  Street layout. The street layout shall be devised for the most advantageous development of the entire neighborhood in which the land to be subdivided is located. Existing streets that abut the subdivision shall be continued, and the continuations shall be at least as wide as the existing streets and in alignment with them. The street layout shall also provide for the future projection into unsubdivided lands adjoining of a sufficient number of streets to provide convenient circulation.

(7)  Alleys. Alleys shall be provided in the commercial and industrial districts of subdivisions; the planning commission may, however, waive this requirement where other definite and assured provision is made for service access, including off-street loading and unloading, consistent with and adequate to the uses proposed. Where necessary for safe vehicular movement, an alley right-of-way shall be increased in width or the corners cut at its intersection with a street. Closed-end alleys shall be avoided but, if unavoidable, shall be provided with an adequate turnaround, as specified for closed-end streets. In general, alleys will not be approved for residential districts of subdivisions. 
(8)  Streets at business centers. In front of schools and in front of areas zoned or designed for commercial or industrial uses, the street width and the roadway width of a minor street, a collector street or a closed-end street shall be increased on the side on which the land for the school or for commercial or industrial use is located by at least fifteen (15) feet to insure the free flow of traffic without interference by vehicles entering or leaving parking areas. (This is not a parking space requirement and shall not affect requirement by zoning ordinance or otherwise for off-street parking facilities; neither shall fulfillment of this requirement and its acceptance by the planning commission be deemed approval or endorsement of any amendment to the zoning ordinance necessary for such commercial or industrial uses.) 
(9)  Half streets. No new half street shall be platted. Where a tract of land to be subdivided abuts upon an existing half street, the other half of the street shall be platted.

(a)  The purpose of this article is to alleviate the growth of sign usage that is detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the city. Recognizing that this city is one of Mississippi's and the South's foremost coastal resorts, the mayor and city council finds that the lack of control and/or improper control of signs causes a unique problem. Although the city has more to offer than its resort resources, the attraction and servicing of visitors constitutes one (1) of our leading economic activities. Failure to recognize this matter could adversely impact development of such resources and activities. 
(b)  In keeping with this purpose and intent, this article is designed to permit only such signs as will not, by their reason, size, location, construction, or manner of display, endanger the public safety of individuals, confuse, mislead, or obstruct the vision necessary for traffic safety, or otherwise endanger public health, safety, and morals; and to permit and regulate signs in such a manner as to support and complement land-use objectives in such a fashion that high standards for the visual environment within all areas of the city are developed and maintained. 
(Ord. No. 1764, § 1.1, 3-17-87) 
Sec. 9-80. - Permits required. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this article, it shall be unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge, move or convert any sign in the city, or cause the same to be done, without first obtaining a sign permit for each such sign from the building inspector as required by this article. These directives shall not be construed to require any permit for a change of copy on any sign, nor for the repainting, cleaning and other normal maintenance or repair of a sign or sign structure for which a permit has previously been issued, so long as the sign or sign structure is not modified in any way. No new permit is required for signs which have permits and which conform with the requirements of this article on March 17, 1987, unless and until the sign is altered or relocated in any manner whatsoever, except as provided for hereinabove. 
(Ord. No. 1764, § 3.1, 3-17-87) 
Sec. 9-81. - Sign contractor's license. 
    Sign contractors shall be licensed. No person shall perform any work or service for any person or for any government entity for compensation, in or in connection with the erection, construction, enlargement, alteration, repair, moving, improvement, maintenance, conversion or manufacture of any sign in the city, or any work or service in connection with causing any such work to be done unless such person is a registered sign contractor within the city. Individuals performing any of the above for their own business or on their own property and not for compensation will be exempt from this section. Placement of a portable or temporary sign shall not constitute a sign contractor. 
(1)  The building official is hereby granted the authority to recommend to the building code board of adjustment and appeals that a sign contractor's license be suspended or revoked if: (1) the license was issued in error, or (2) the license was incorrect, or (3) the contractor has failed to comply with the ordinances and regulations of the city relating to the work for which the license was issued. 
(2)  No license may be revoked or suspended until after a hearing is held by the building code board of adjustment and appeals. The contractor shall be mailed notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing at least ten (10) days in advance. The notice shall also state the exact ordinances or regulations the contractor is alleged to have violated or in what way the information stated on the application was incorrect. The contractor may appear at the hearing, may be represented by counsel, may question witnesses, and may present testimony if he wishes. 
(3)  After the hearing by board of adjustment and appeals, the building official may suspend the license for any period of time up to six (6) months. After the decision is rendered the contractor may petition for reinstatement of the license following the six-month period after revocation or suspension of such license. 
(4)  The license fee for a sign contractor shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00). The contractor license (certificate of competency) may be renewed from year to year upon payment of the license fee listed above, without reexamination, provided that proof of insurance is provided.

(1)  The sign is altered in any way in structure or copy (except for changeable copy signs and normal maintenance), which tends to or makes the sign less in compliance with the requirements of this article than it was before the alteration. 
(2)  The sign is relocated to a position making it less in compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(3)  Changed to another nonconforming sign.

In any event, the sign existing hereunder shall conform to the provisions for outdoor advertising signs specified in subsection 9-91(h)(4). 
(5)  Re-established after deterioration, damage or destruction of more than fifty (50) percent of the value, or fifty (50) percent of the area of the sign.

Further, in the event a legal conforming and/or legal nonconforming outdoor advertising sign is damaged or destroyed by an act of God or similar force majeure, such sign shall be allowed to be repaired or replaced, upon removal of the applicable damaged sign structure(s), by the registered owner, operator, and/or holder of said sign on the same site providing no change is made which makes the sign less in compliance with this article and without the necessity of removing additional sign structure(s). Should any legal nonconforming sign be required to be moved because of a highway or road widening or other government project, and the sign can be located in approximately the same location but outside the new right-of-way or project boundaries, said relocation shall be allowed, by the registered owner, operator, and/or holder of said sign, but the sign shall continue to maintain its legal conforming and/or legal nonconforming status as applicable.

(Ord. No. 2536, § 8.0, 5-9-07) 
Sec. 10-123. - Evaluation process. 
(a)  [Two-phase minimum.] The evaluation process for determining the need for in-building amplification is conducted in a minimum of two phases: pre-construction and acceptance/implementation. 
(b)  Pre-construction phase. 
(1)  Before the construction of the new building, basic information can be gathered to begin the process of determining the need, type and actual implementation of augmentation to the radio system. In most cases, the following information must be known to properly design and cost estimate an in-building radio system. 
a.  New building information. 
1.  Type/size of building-Single story, multilevel, square footage, number of stories. 
2.  Orientation of building-Above/below ground, line of sight. 
3.  Construction of the outer and inner walls-Plaster, drywall, brick, sheet metal. 
4.  Proposed equipment locations-Equipment rooms, cableways, conduits. 
5.  Building location-Longitude and latitude coordinates. 
6.  Local building code requirements and special requirements. 
7.  Building blueprints and drawings. 
b.  Existing system information. To be supplied by Harrison County Emergency Communications Commission. 
1.  Public safety radio network site location nearest to construction locations. 
2.  Donor channel frequency-Specific digital channel to enhance radio coverage. 
3.  Grade of service required to meet coverage requirements. 
4.  Type of subscriber unit. 
5.  Number of channels and their frequencies. 
6.  Signal strength of donor site at the building locations. 
With the information above, the following steps can establish the potential need for a building amplifier. 
c.  Needs determination-Signal strength measurements. 
1.  At the planned construction site, measure (or have measured) the signal strength of the donor control channel. 
2.  If the signal strength of the donor is -95 dBm or less on the outside of the building, the probability of additional in-building coverage is high. 
3.  If the signal strength of the donor is greater than 95 dBm, determine the expected signal strength of the donor by subtracting the sum of the interior losses due to walls, doors, and windows from the ambient signal outside the building. (See table 1.) 
4.  If a signal strength of -95 dBm or greater is calculated at the innermost point of the building, an in-building system may not be required. 
5.  If a signal strength is calculated at -95 dBm or less, an in-building system is warranted. 
6.  To determine signal strengths for specific areas and evaluate the impact of the proposed building on existing structures, consult the latest Harrison County Emergency Communications District RF Survey Report. 
7.  If determined that an in-building amplification system is required for either the proposed site or existing structures impacted by the proposed construction, provide placeholder in budget for cost of communication system based on results of the above. 
(c)  Acceptance test procedures. 
(1)  Acceptance testing for an in-building radio amplification system is required, upon completion of installation of the system is required, upon completion of installation of the system. It is the owner's responsibility to have the radio amplifier system functionally tested to ensure adequate two-way coverage provided on each floor of the building is in compliance with requirements as set forth in this division. 
(2)  A minimally acceptable test plan shall require that each floor of the building be divided into a grid of approximately twenty (20) equal areas. A maximum of two (2) nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test. 
(3)  In the event that three (3) of the areas fail the test, in order to be more statistically accurate, the floor may be divided into forty (40) equal areas. In such event, a maximum of four nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test. After the forty (40) area tests, and if the system continues to fail, the owner shall repair, replace, alter, or upgrade the system to meet the coverage requirements of this division. 
(4)  Talk-out and talk-back testing from the building site to the Harrison County Public Safety Radio Network shall use a three-watt portable transceiver without speaker/microphone and flexible antenna. 
(5)  A test location approximately in the center of a grid area will be selected for the test, then the radio will be keyed with a voice message used to verify two-way communication to and from the outside of the building. 
(6)  Once the test location has been selected, use of another test location within the grid area will not be permitted. Each test location will also require the capture of the actual signal strength (measured in units of dBm) at that location. 
(7)  Signal strength testing instruments are to be recently calibrated (within the past twelve (12) months prior to testing) and of a frequency selective type incorporating an antenna similar to the ones used on the hand-held transceivers. 
(8)  The gain values of all building amplifiers shall be measured and the results kept on file with the owner so that building amplifier performance measurements can be verified each year during the annual tests. 
(9)  In the event that the measurement results become lost, the owner will be required to rerun the coverage acceptance test to reestablish the gain values. 
(Ord. No. 2536, § 9.0, 5-9-07) 
Sec. 10-124. - Annual tests. 
(a)  Once an in-building radio amplifier system is installed, the building owner shall test all active components of the system including but not limited to amplifier, power supplies, and back-up batteries, a minimum of once every twelve (12) months. 
(b)  Amplifiers shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance. 
(c)  Back-up batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load for a period of one hour to verify that they will operate during an actual power outage. 
(d)  All other radio signal radiating components shall be checked to determine that they are operating within the manufacturer's specifications for the intended purpose. 
(Ord. No. 2536, § 10.0, 5-9-07) 
Sec. 10-125. - Five-year test. 
(a)  In addition to the annual test, the owner shall perform a radio coverage test a minimum of once every five years to ensure that the radio system continues to meet the requirements of the ordinance at the time of original implementation. 
(b)  The procedure set forth above shall apply to such tests. 
(Ord. No. 2536, § 11.0, 5-9-07) 
Sec. 10-126. - Qualifications of testing personnel. 
(a)  All tests shall be conducted, documented, and witnessed by a person in possession of a current FCC general radiotelephone operator license or a manufacturer-authorized maintenance agent for the Harrison County Emergency Communications Commission radio system. 
(b)  All test records shall be retained at the inspected premises by the owner and a copy submitted to the Harrison County Emergency Communications Commission and the City of Gulfport within thirty (30) days of when the test has been conducted. 
(c)  In the event the test results fail to comply with the minimum requirements of the Harrison County Emergency Communications Commission and the City of Gulfport, appropriate repairs shall be made and additional tests conducted until tests meet the minimum requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2536, § 12.0, 5-9-07) 
Sec. 10-127. - Inspections. 
(a)  Harrison County Emergency Communications Commission and City of Gulfport personnel (or their representative), after providing reasonable notice to the owner or his representative, shall have the right to enter onto the property to conduct field verification to be certain that the required minimum level of radio coverage is present. 
(b)  The cost associated with this activity is the responsibility of the owner. 
(c)  Repairs or upgrades needed to correct identified amplifier system shortfalls, to bring failed systems into compliance with the technical and functional requirements of this division, are the responsibility of the Owner. 
(Ord. No. 2536, § 13.0, 5-9-07)

D(H - 100)] 8.34 / 1000 x I x J = Surcharge Payment ($/Mo) 
Where: 
A equals surcharge rate for BOD, in $/pound. 
B equals surcharge rate for SS, in $/pound. 
C equals surcharge rate for TKN, in $/pound. 
D equals surcharge rate for grease, in $/pound. 
E equals industrial user's BOD concentration, in mg/l. 
F equals industrial user's SS concentration, in mg/l. 
G equals industrial user's TKN concentration, in mg/l. 
H equals industrial user's grease concentration, in mg/l. 
I equals industrial user's flow to sewage works, in 1,000 gallons/day. 
J equals number of days in month. 
(2)  No reduction in sewage service charges, fees, or taxes shall be permitted because of the fact that certain industrial wastes discharged to the sewage works contain less than three hundred (300) milligrams per liter of BOD, three hundred (300) milligrams per liter of SS, forty (40) milligrams per liter of TKN or less than one hundred (100) milligrams per liter of grease. 
(d)  Amendments. This section shall be amended, as necessary, to comply with federal regulations.

(1)  Wells shall have an outer casing of wrought iron or black steel pipe having a standard line pipe weight. Joints may be welded or made up with heavy threaded couplings. 
(1)  (a)  Alternate casing material. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe may be used for well casing or liner pipe for drilled wells only. All casing material shall be new and shall conform to the manufacturing standard ASTM F480. Any PVC pipe used for well construction or repair shall, at a minimum, meet specifications for ASA schedule 40 and have a working pressure rating of not less than two hundred (200) p.s.i. at seventy-three (73) degrees F. Other nonmetallic pipe shall not be used. Joints shall be joined by solvent bonding, threaded couplings, or other method approved by the manufacturer. 
(2)  Drilled wells shall not be closer than one-half mile horizontally to an existing well furnishing water to the people of the city. 
(3)  The annular ring between the outside of the casing and the wall of the hole shall be scaled by forcing into it a neat portland cement grout, using the Halliburton Method or an approved equal, and weighing not less than fourteen and five-tenths (14.5) pounds per gallon. The annular ring shall not be less than one and one-half (1.5) inches in thickness. 
(4)  Tight joint between well casing and pump head: Pump head shall be connected to the outside casing by a watertight threaded connection or by the outside casing being carried to a point not less than one (1) inch above the pump head foundation. Before setting the pump head casing the contractor shall pour cement grout over the pump head foundation to provide a seal between the foundation and pump head casing to prevent water entering the well under the pump head casing when a partial vacuum is created. 
(5)  The casing shall extend from the top of the water bearing sand to a point at least one (1) inch above the top of the motor foundation. 
(6)  No drilling operation or other work in the well will be permitted within seventy-two (72) hours after the grouting of the casing, except that should quick-setting cement be used, this period may be reduced to twenty-four (24) hours. 
(7)  Provision for disinfection: Upon approaching the water-bearing stratum the contractor shall, from then on until the completion of the well-drilling operation, carry not less than five (5) parts per million of free chlorine in the drilling water and mud. Not less than one (1) part per million of free chlorine shall be maintained in the water used for development. In the case of gravel wall wells the contractor shall disinfect the gravel as it is being placed in the well with a water solution containing not less than five (5) parts per million of free chlorine. 
(8)  Upon completion of the well, it shall be disinfected with a chlorine solution of such strength and volume that at least fifty (50) parts per million will be obtained in all parts of the well. The solution shall remain in the well for at least four (4) hours. 
(9)  After development of the well, a minimum of two (2) consecutive chlorine-free water samples shall be examined by the state board of health for their approval, and upon approval being received by the city, such water supply may then be utilized. 
(10)  Pump head foundation: Pump head shall be mounted on a chamfered concrete foundation not smaller than twenty-four (24) inches square at the top, extending not less than eighteen (18) inches into solid ground and not less than eighteen (18) inches above the finished grade. If the pump head base is fitted with vacuum relief openings, these shall be protected by nipples and inverted ells, capped with fly screen. 
(11)  Provision for sampling directly from well: Contractor shall furnish and install on the pump discharge pipe near the pump head a three-quarter-inch hose bib in a horizontal position. 
(12)  Provision for filling test holes or abandoned well holes: Any test holes drilled shall be, when they have served their purpose, backfilled to the surface of the ground with clay mud carrying five (5) parts per million of free chlorine. If, for any reason, the contractor shall abandon any hole drilled for developing the well, he shall likewise backfill all such holes as provided herein for test holes. In each case the top twenty (20) feet of mud placed in any hole shall be thoroughly compacted. 
(13)  Determination of depth of well: The boring samples shall be obtained at intervals of ten (10) feet and shall be submitted to the state board of health for their findings.

    The city shall have the right to inspect equipment, materials and methods during any well construction within the city, and also to reject or condemn any work or materials not in accordance with, or complying with the above specifications. 
(Code 1963, § 30-8) 
Sec. 11-135. - Costs of analysis borne by owner. 
    As to any costs incurred in submitting and having approved water samples or strata samples as hereinafter set out, any expenses in connection therewith shall be borne by the contractor as well as owner. If a laboratory other than the state board of health shall be selected to do the analysis, it shall be approved by the city. 
(Code 1963, § 30-9) 
Sec. 11-136. - Reservation of rights to city. 
    The issuance of a permit to construct a well in either category and the installation of any well thereunder shall not, in any event, cause the city to be liable for any interference with the flow or quality of water of such well, should the city at any time in the future find it necessary to construct a well in the near vicinity of any well so permitted; and the city shall be authorized in any event to construct its own wells as may be required or necessary for its normal function, at any point within the city, disregarding the location or depth of any privately owned well, and notwithstanding that permit for the construction or drilling of any well has theretofore been issued by the city. 
(Code 1963, § 30-10) 
Sec. 11-137. - Additional remedies. 
    In addition to the foregoing, in event of any violation of this article, or threatened or impending violation thereof, the city shall be further authorized to institute such injunctive or other legal proceedings as may be necessary in order to preserve the public health, safety and interest involved, and to prevent any violation or continued violation of this article.

(f)  Design review. 
General. 
1.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to ensure that the physical characteristics of proposed developments are compatible when considered within the context of the surrounding area. 
2.  Applicability, requirements: 
(i)  Project design review is required for all plans for commercial and multifamily. 
(ii)  All plans and specifications submitted with an application for a building permit in zoning classification B-2 shall be reviewed by the department of urban development and design review board to ascertain whether or not the proposed structure or alteration is excessively similar or not similar to any other structure either existing or for which a permit has been issued within one thousand (1,000) feet of the proposed site as measured from each lot line. 
(iii)  If the design review board determines that such structure or alteration as proposed would provide one or more harmful effects on the aforesaid structures, then the application for approval shall be denied. 
(iv)  Considering all elements of design review as a whole, permits with minor variations not harmful to compatibility will not be unreasonably denied. 
3.  General compatibility requirement: 
(i)  Assuming that surrounding structures are considered by the design review board to be a credit to the community, all development subject to this article shall be compatible with the established architectural character of the surrounding area by using a design that is complementary to nearby architectural styles, designs, and forms. This does not imply uniformity of architectural style; rather it requires that new buildings are sympathetically responsive to aspects of nearby structures. 
Building aesthetics. 
(1)  Purpose. Building aesthetics establish a base criteria related to the appearance of specific structures. These regulations strike a balance between creativity and innovation on one hand, while avoiding obtrusive, incongruous structures on the other. The city strongly discourages architectural styles that do not build upon and promote the beautiful character of the city. The city supports the view that inspiring, well-maintained, and harmonious development is in the best economic development interests of all residents and businesses. 
(2)  Building design: 
(i)  Awnings and canopies. Awnings or other ornamental design features shall be of appropriate scale, shape, color, scheme and pattern in order to reinforce good design principles. They shall also complement the color and material of the building to which they are affixed. 
(ii)  Massing. A single, large, dominant building mass shall be avoided. Where large structures are required, mass should be broken up through the use of setbacks, projecting and/or recessed elements, and similar design techniques. 
(3)  Special features. Functional and/or ornamental features shall not use incompatible or extraordinary scale, color schemes, patterns or other extraordinary features for the purpose of attracting attention. 
(4)  Harmony of design. 
(i)  Building color shades. Colors shall be harmonious with the development in the project area, and bright and brilliant colors used only for accent. Building color shades shall facilitate blending into the neighborhood and unifying the project. The color shades of building materials shall draw from the range of color shades that already exist on the block or in the adjacent neighborhood. Neon tubing is prohibited. 
(ii)  Building materials. The choice of building materials, landscaping, and site improvements shall be commensurate with or improve upon the surrounding area both visually and structurally without generating an adverse visual impact on surrounding properties. Architectural style or design is not restricted. 
(iii)  Evaluation of projects. Evaluation of the appearance of a project shall be based on the quality of the design characteristics and relationship to the area in which the project is located. 
Architectural character. 
(1)  Purpose. Architectural character focuses on the micro-level details that greatly affect the overall appearance of a particular development. These architectural character regulations provide direction in aspects of color, facade materials, rooflines, and the enhancement of entryways. The primary goal is to define the "finishing touches" that provide the development with a sense of permanence, style, and compatibility. The city actively discourages proposals that have not taken these matters into account. The city desires that all development be treated as a lasting contributor to the community and as a "good neighbor" to its surroundings. 
(2)  Roofs. 
(i)  Variations in rooflines are required to reduce the massive scale of structures and add visual interest. 
(ii)  Roofs must have at least two (2) of the following features: parapets concealing flat roofs and rooftop equipment, overhanging eaves, sloped roofs and three (3) or more roof slopes planes. Mechanical equipment or other utility hardware other than antennas and stacks on roofs and any other exterior service areas shall be harmonious with the building or they shall be located and/or screened so as not to be visible from any public ways within the impacted area. 
(iii)  Roof shape (for example: flat, hip, mansard, or gable) and material shall be architecturally compatible with facade elements and the rest of the building. 
(3)  Façades. 
(i)  Recesses and projections. Building façades that are visible from the street and surrounding property must incorporate architectural features to break up large wall planes into smaller components and visual interest. Recesses and projections shall be allocated along the length of the façade. Façades not meeting this requirement will not be allowed. For retail and general business uses, any side of building or structure greater than seventy-five (75) feet in length shall incorporate recesses and/or projections along at least twenty (20) percent of the length. Recesses and projections shall be of sufficient measurements to affect the intent of this provision. 
(ii)  Repeating design patterns. Architectural interest in the main structure shall be accomplished by the use of repeating pattern of change in color, texture and material modules. No more than thirty (30) percent of the consecutive façade may remain without architectural detail, including but not limited to balconies, recessed walls, changes in color and/or texture, varying roof lines, curved and angled walls, fenestration and cantilevers. 
(iii)  Renovations. Facade renovations shall incorporate original building details to the maximum extent practicable. 
(iv)  Materials. Predominant exterior building material surfaces shall be of high quality. These include, but are not limited to, brick, wood, sandstone or stucco, or other native stone and tinted/textured concrete masonry units. Unpainted, smooth faced concrete block and prefabricated steel panels are prohibited. 
(v)  Required entryway features. Each principal building on a site should have a clearly defined, highly visible customer entrance featuring no less than two of the following: canopies or porticos, arcades, arches, wing walls, and/or planters. 
(vi)  Building placement. The exterior and placement of buildings and structures, including appearance, scale, size, mass, façade and its orientation, along with roof line and building materials, shall be in harmony with the site and other construction in the impacted area. 
(vii)  Fences and screening. Loading docks, trash collection and similar uses and functions shall be incorporated into the overall design of the building and landscaping so the visual and acoustic impact of these functions are contained and out of view or hearing from adjacent properties and public streets to the most practicable extent possible. 
Appeals. An owner or developer may appeal a decision of the design review board to the city planning commission upon payment of a one hundred dollar ($100.00) dollar fee within fifteen (15) days of notice of denial of the permit request. An appeal decision of the planning commission may be appealed to the Gulfport City Council by filing with the urban development staff a written notice of appeal specifying the design review board decision from which the appeal is taken; and an appeal decision of the city council may be appealed to the court of jurisdiction as provided in the Mississippi Code of 1972, as amended.

The geographic location of these districts is indicated on the city's official zoning map, having been duly adopted by the city as per the requirements of this zoning ordinance provision. The noise districts are as follows: 
1.  The area within the 65 LDN to 70 LDN noise-exposure area. 
2.  The area within the 70 LDN to 75 LDN noise-exposure area. 
3.  The area within the 75 LDN and greater noise-exposure area. 
(b)  Height/Airspace Overlay. The Gulfport-Biloxi Regional Airport Height/Airspace Map depicts districts that represent differing levels of height/airspace restrictions. The geographic location of three (3) of such districts are indicated on the city's official zoning map, having been duly adopted by the city in accordance with the requirements of this zoning ordinance. The height/airspace districts that are incorporated into the zoning ordinance are as follows: 
1.  Primary surface as defined in section III, (I)(2)(i) above. 
2.  Approach surface as defined in section III, (I)(2)(j) above.

All proposed uses and structures must comply with these standards. 
1.  Land use compatibility locational standards. 
a.  Parcels partially within the Land Use Compatibility Overlay Area. 
(i)  That portion of any parcel which falls without the Land Use Compatibility Overlay Area shall be treated in the same manner as parcels wholly without the Land Use Compatibility Overlay Area, and shall be governed by the planning and zoning regulations of the relevant local authority, except as to height; notwithstanding that when an avigation easement is required by subsection (7) of this article, the avigation easement shall be made to apply to the entire parcel or project. 
(ii)  That portion of the parcel falling within the Land Use Compatibility Overlay Area shall be treated in the same manner as parcels wholly within the Land Use Compatibility Overlay Area, using the procedures established in this ordinance. 
(iii)  The owner of the entire parcel may act to subdivide the parcel, so as to create two (2) parcels, one wholly without the Land Use Compatibility Overlay Area and one wholly within the Land Use Compatibility Overlay Area. When the owner does so, all applicable use restrictions and zoning requirements of the city zoning ordinance shall apply to each parcel separately. 
b.  Parcels wholly within the Airport Environs Area. 
(i)  Permissible uses are those uses indicated as compatible in the Airport Environs Area Land Use Compatibility-Table A. 
(ii)  Those uses indicated as "Yes-with restrictions," must be approved in writing by the planning division administrator when he or she is satisfied that the restriction has been satisfied. 
(7)  Avigation easement. Relative to the nonpermissible uses, and uses compatible with restrictions, as per Table A, and in the case of a variance or special exception or planning commission approval, the applicant, prior to receiving final approval of said request, shall convey to the Gulfport-Biloxi Regional Airport Authority an avigation easement permitting the right of flight in the airspace and all other stipulations and restrictions of the easement above the subject property. Such easement shall be supplied in a form prescribed by the city planning division administrator in conjunction with the Gulfport-Biloxi Regional Airport Authority and shall be recorded in the land records in the office of the Chancery Clerk, First Judicial District, Harrison County, Mississippi. When an avigation easement is required by this ordinance, it shall be made to apply to the entire parcel of land. When a project consists of multiple parcels of land, the avigation easement will be made to apply to all parcels used in the project whether or not a specific parcel lies within an area where an avigation easement would be required.

(10)  Townhouse and zero lot line residential uses. The purpose of this district is to provide for the development of moderate-to-high-density residential uses and structures in moderately spacious surroundings but so designed as to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public. It is the intent of this ordinance [subsection IV(A)(10)] that these uses be allowed where appropriate in the city where a protected environment suitable for moderate-density residential use can be provided, as well as in established moderate-density residential areas as a means to ensure their continuance. However, this use is appropriate on a smaller scale in the suburban portions of the city as a transitional or buffer zone between low-density residential districts and commercial districts, industrial districts or major transportation arteries, or other uses that are not compatible with a low-density residential environment. In fulfilling the purpose of this use, the townhouse or row house concept may be used which permits the construction of single-family dwellings immediately adjacent to one another without side yards between the individual units. The purpose of this use may also be fulfilled by the use of the zero lot line concept which permits the construction of detached single-family dwellings on lots without a side yard requirement on at least one side of the lot. This concept permits better use of the entire lot by compacting the usual front, rear and side yards. In order to allow any deviation from the following minimum requirements for these types of development, the developer must show evidence that such deviation will not adversely affect the health, safety and welfare of the public.

Where a lot or lots located in a residence district contains less than the minimum required building site area for the district and on the effective date of this ordinance was lawfully existing and of record and held in separate and different ownership from any lot immediately adjoining and having continuous frontage, such lot may be used as the building site for a one-family dwelling. 
(2)  Business or industry on small building site. Where a lot or lots located in an industrial district, in a residence business district or in a residence-office district contains less than the minimum required building site area for the district and on the effective date of this ordinance was lawfully existing and of record and held in separate and different ownership from any lot immediately adjoining and having continuous frontage, such lot may be used as the building site for any use permitted in the district. 
(C)  Supplementary height regulations. 
(1)  Height exceptions. The height limitations contained in the district regulations do not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, antennas, water tanks, ventilators, chimneys, parapet walls, cornices or necessary mechanical appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level and not intended for human occupancy. 
(2)  Excess height. Upon application filed with the zoning board of adjustment and appeals, a hearing thereon and upon approval thereof, any main structure may be erected or altered in any district to a height in excess of that specified for the district in which the structure is located provided that the excessive height is in harmony with land uses and growth and development within the neighborhood and generally with existing and future development located within the city and that each dimension provided herein for required front, side and rear yard is increased one foot every two (2) feet of such excess height; provided, further, where no yard is required, the part of the structure exceeding the height specified for the district shall be set back from the vertical lane of the adjacent building site line one (1) foot for every two (2) feet of such excess height. The erection or alteration of any structure to a height exceeding fifty (50) 
feet shall be permitted only upon certification by the chief of the Gulfport Fire Department that the necessary facilities and equipment are available for protection of the higher structure. 
(3)  Compensating bulk and open space. To permit variety in the shape and bulk of structures, upon approval of the planning commission and subject to such limitations as it may prescribe for the protection of adjacent property, in any district, part of a main structure may be erected or altered to a height in excess of that specified for the district in which the structure is located, provided a volume of space at least equal to the volume of space occupied by the part of the structure exceeding the height limit is provided and kept open below the height limit. It is intended that such open space below the height limit shall compensate for the bulk above the height limit, and to this end both the excess bulk and the compensating open space shall be provided on the same building site. 
(D)  Supplementary yard regulations. 
(1)  Buffer planting strips. Wherever the boundary of a building site in a B-1, B-2, B-3, E-G, I-1 or I-2 district adjoins an R-1, R-2, R-O or R-B district, and where a business use in an R-B district adjoins a one-family, two-family or multiple-family dwelling, there shall be provided on such business or industrial building site a buffer strip not less than fifteen (15) feet in width. Any required yard shall comply with the following regulations: 
(a)  Landscaping. Screen planting shall be provided in sufficient density and of sufficient height to afford protection to the residence district from the glare of lights, from blowing paper, dust and debris, from visual encroachment, and to effectively reduce the transmission of noise. Screen planting shall be maintained in a clean and neat condition. The initial height of the planting must be a minimum of four (4) feet and of such a variety that the vegetation will grow to a minimum height of seven (7) feet within twenty-four (24) months of planting. 
(b)  Use of land. No part of a buffer planting strip shall be used for any purpose other than screen planting unless such screen planting is provided adjacent to the residence district or residentially used property in an R-B and R-O districts in sufficient depth and density to accomplish the purpose of protection, in which case as much as five (5) feet of the required fifteen (15) feet may be used for parking or other open space uses not in conflict with the purpose of protection of the adjacent residence district nor in violation of any other provision of this ordinance. 
(c)  Screen wall. If a lot of record on the effective date of this ordinance is so unusually small that enforcement of the minimum required buffer planting strip precludes the reasonable use of the property, then a variance may be considered upon approval of the board of adjustment, and subject to such conditions as it may prescribe as necessary to achieve the purpose of screen planting, a solid screen wall of permanent material eight (8) feet high with a buffer planting strip no less than ten (10) feet in width may be substituted for the screen planting. 
The requirements for a buffer planting strip may be waived by the board of commissioners in amending this ordinance to create or expand a business or industry district upon a report from the planning commission stating that future extension of the business or industry district is anticipated and that the proposed building wall will present an acceptable appearance to the adjacent residence district. Waiver of the requirement for a buffer planting strip shall not constitute waiver of any side yard requirement. 
(2)  Minimum side yard width. In any district where side yards are not required by the district regulations, if a side yard is provided it shall have a width of at least five (5) feet. 
(3)  Corner building site. In any district, a corner building site having to its rear a building site facing toward the intersecting or side street shall have provided on the intersecting or side street side of the corner building site a side yard having a width equal at least to the depth of the front yard required for a structure on the building site to the rear of the corner building site; provided, however, that this regulation shall not be applied to reduce the buildable width of the corner building site to less than thirty (30) feet. 
(4)  Visibility at intersections. On a corner building site in any district in which a front yard is required, no fence, wall, hedge, structure or planting creating a material impediment to visibility between the heights of three (3) feet and eight (8) feet above the street grade at the intersection shall be erected, placed or maintained within the triangular area formed by the intersecting street lines and a straight line connecting such street lines at points equidistant from such point of intersection and passing through a point, which point is the intersection of lines defining the required front and side yards. Off-street and on-street parking within the subject triangular area is especially prohibited. 
(5)  Side yard exception for small lots. Where side yards are required and a lot of record is less than sixty (60) feet in width and on the effective date of this ordinance was lawfully existing and of record, each side yard shall have a width of not less than two-fifteenths ( 2/15 ) the width of the lot; provided, however, that in no case shall either side yard have a width of less than five (5) feet. 
(6)  Major street right-of-way. Front yard depth, and in the case of a corner building site, side yard width shall be measured from the future street right-of-way of a major street established on the Plan for Circulation (Major Street Plan), a part of the Master Plan for the City of Gulfport. 
(7)  Fences, walls, and hedges. 
(a)  General design and material regulation. 
1.  All privately owned fences, walls, and hedges must be on the property owned by the owner of the subject fence and must not be in any right-of-way. 
2.  Ground level may not be altered for purposes of allowing a higher fence, wall, or hedge.

13.  On a drainage or irrigation easement, an owner may fence their property, but the water flow cannot be interrupted and must allow full access to the holder of the easement for the purpose of the easement. This may require gates to access the property with both foot traffic and equipment required to maintain the ditch or pipe. It is the responsibility of the property owner to contact those who own the easements and get approval of the fence, gate, etc., design. 
(b)  Residential Districts including R-O, R-B, T4L and T4+.

(9)  Front yard exception for established residential neighborhoods. Where development is taking place in an established residential neighborhood with lots of record that were lawfully existing on the effective date of this appendix, the front yard setback may be adjusted to allow for consistent development to accommodate infill. The residential dwelling front yard setback will be based on the adjacent building sites (parcels). The contractor, when submitting the site plan, will also identify the principal building setbacks for the adjacent properties by affidavit. If property or properties adjacent to the principle buildings have a front yard setback of fifteen (15) feet or less, the new construction may use the front yard setback of fifteen (15) feet or greater. Newly created residential subdivisions must meet the requirements of the zoning district in which they are located. 
(E)  Supplementary design standards. 
(1)  Application & review process: For projects subject to review as defined below, applicants will be required to submit proposed site plans, landscape plans, building elevations, photographs of adjacent and surrounding properties, and information regarding proposed building materials. Such information will be used as the basis for a determination of compliance or non-compliance with applicable design standards. 
    Upon review of applications, staff may deem a project not in compliance with applicable design standards and forward the application to the Architectural Review Committee (ARC) for review. The ARC will review the application and prepare a determination of compliance or non-compliance with applicable design standards. For projects the ARC finds the project not in compliance, the applicant may revise plans and resubmit for staff review or appeal the decision to the planning commission. 
    The planning commission will review such applications and prepare a determination of compliance or non-compliance. If the planning commission finds the project not in compliance, the decision may be appealed to the city council by filing with staff a written notice of appeal specifying the decision from which the appeal is taken. A decision of the city council may be appealed to the court of jurisdiction as provided in the Mississippi Code of 1972, as amended. 
(2)  Residential projects 
    The standards of this section apply to residential building projects meeting the following criteria: 
New single family residential buildings in new subdivisions. New construction of residential buildings in new subdivisions of greater than twenty five (25) lots platted after the effective date of these ordinance revisions.

(a)  Design Standards 
1.  Site design. 
1.1.  General. 
i.  Projects should consider their influence on neighboring properties. Projects should be designed to contribute to the overall character, identity, and attractiveness of a neighborhood or district and minimize impacts on nearby property zoned for lower density/intensity uses. 
ii.  Natural features such as viewsheds, trees, wetlands, drainage ways, and other features unique to the site should be preserved and incorporated into development proposals. 
iii.  Open spaces and play areas should be safe, centrally-located, easily-accessible by pedestrian sidewalks and paths, and visible from adjacent sidewalks and roadways to allow for informal surveillance. 
1.2.  Site configuration and building placement. 
i.  Building placement and site configuration should reflect the prevailing pattern of the neighborhood. 
ii.  Buildings serving common purposes in multiple-family projects should be placed in a prominent location and help define public spaces, terminate vistas, and screen service drives and areas. 
iii.  Primary building entries should be located on front façades, designed to be visible from adjacent streets and sidewalks, and offer protected from the elements with a covered porch or stoop. 
iv.  Separate building along the same street frontage should be built along relatively continuous front setback lines with slight variations allowed to provide relief. 
1.3.  Fencing and screening. 
i.  Front yard walls and fencing taller than three (3) feet in height are discouraged in residential neighborhoods. 
ii.  Fencing or screening material and designs should match or complement the fencing materials and designs on adjoining properties. Materials and finishes should be durable and easily maintained. Brick, wood, stucco or wrought iron are the preferred materials. 
1.4.  Storage, utilities, and mechanical equipment. 
i.  Areas for outdoor storage, including within carports and beneath elevated buildings, should be screened from public view through a combination of location on property, building design, landscaping, fencing, and architectural screening or enclosure. 
ii.  All ground-level mechanical equipment, including but not limited to satellite dishes, propane tanks, antenna, irrigation controllers, ladders, vent pipes, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units, and alarm boxes, should be located away from public view to side or rear of the primary building and should be screened from view from street with architectural enclosures (integrated into the building design) or landscape screens. 
iii.  When rooftop or elevated placement of mechanical is necessary, the equipment should be located on the side or rear of the building to limit street visibility. In addition, roof mounted equipment on multi-family buildings should be screened from the view of adjacent properties. 
iv.  New public utilities and infrastructure should be placed underground or in rear alleys if feasible. 
1.5.  Landscaping. 
i.  Landscaping on individual lots should be designed to reinforce a neighborhood's sense of place and identity, provide privacy, screen mechanical and utility equipment otherwise visible from public streets, and ease transitions among adjacent buildings. 
ii.  Where possible, existing landscape elements should be incorporated and preserved. Healthy mature trees and tree groupings should be preserved as design determinants. Mature trees on project sites should be protected and preserved as per City of Gulfport tree preservation standards. 
iii.  The front yard area of individual lots should include at least forty (40) percent of the total area in lawn or ground cover, one shade tree, and shrubs as foundation planting along the front façade of buildings. Foundation plantings should be at least twelve (12) inches tall at planting and located in a minimum three (3) foot deep landscape bed with mulch or ground cover. 
iv.  Use of native, drought tolerant species is preferred. 
1.6.  Site and architectural lighting. 
i.  Exterior lighting in residential neighborhoods districts should be limited to lighting of walkways, patios, stoops and porches and the lighting of landscape and building features. 
ii.  Architectural lighting of façades should focus on illuminating the building's surfaces. Light fixtures should include internal reflector caps, refractors, or shields that provide an efficient and focused distribution of light and avoid glare or reflection across property edges or onto adjacent buildings. 
iii.  Illumination design should avoid lighting of the night sky. 
2.  Building design. 
2.1.  General. 
i.  Building design should preserve and enhance the existing community character of Gulfport, contribute to the unique sense of place of the city's neighborhoods and districts, and convey a sense of human-scale through architectural articulation, materials, and proportion. 
ii.  Although no single architectural style or design is preferred in the city, residential building designs should strive for compatibility with other buildings in their neighborhood or Design Standards district. Designers should assess the architectural design, exterior building materials, colors, and arrangement of buildings and other features prior to completing design plans. 
iii.  The introduction of experimental, overly expressive, or unique designs in existing neighborhoods is generally discouraged. Attempts should be made to tie the building into its neighborhood context through the use of similar massing, materials, roof form, architectural styles, or other techniques. 
iv.  New buildings that mimic historical styles are acceptable, but they should be accurate interpretations. Special attention should be paid to materials, proportions, and ornamentation originally used in the proposed style. Accessory buildings and renovations of and additions to existing buildings should follow the architectural style of the primary building. 
2.2  Massing and form. 
i.  The height, form, size, scale, massing, and proportion of new buildings should be compatible with surrounding buildings. For example, the proportion of the main body of the house to its wings, porch projections, and lot width should approximate proportions found in surrounding buildings. 
ii.  Large multiple-family buildings should be designed to reduce their apparent size with projecting wings, dependencies, varying roof profiles and forms that define courtyards, terraces and patios. Façade setbacks, terraces, and changes in color and material can be used to achieve a residential scale. 
iv.  Designs with numerous gables, roof pitches, dormers, and out-of-proportion window and entry treatments, should be avoided in favor of more subtle designs that blend with the historic architecture of the neighborhood or community. 
2.3.  Façades. 
i.  The spacing, placement, scale, orientation, proportion, and size of window and door openings, porches and stoops, bay windows, and other design features should be consistent with treatments typical of the proposed architectural style and compatible with the design character of surrounding buildings. 
ii.  Although residential building façades should be articulated and incorporate residentially scaled architectural details and features, restraint should be used in design. 
2.4.  Porch, awnings, and balconies. 
i.  Covered porches on one-family and two-family dwellings and covered stoops on townhomes dwellings are strongly encouraged. 
ii.  Porches, stoops, awnings, balconies and other architectural projections should be of appropriate scale, shape, color, scheme and pattern in order to reinforce good design principles, and should be designed to complement the color and material of the building to which they are affixed. 
iii.  Covered porches should be scaled and detailed consistent with the proposed Architectural style of the house. Generally, covered porches should be at least six (6) feet deep, at least six (6) feet wide when possible and elevated above grade to match the finished floor level of the house. Covered stoops should be at least four (4) feet deep, four (4) feet wide when possible, and elevated above grade to match the finished floor level of the townhome dwelling. 
2.5.  Roofs and eaves. 
i.  Generally, roofs of residential buildings should be pitched and not flat. Common Pitched roof forms in the City are gabled, hipped, and gambrel. 
ii.  Pitched roofs should be, where possible, symmetrical hips or gables, with a pitch between 4:12 and 12:12. Pitched roofs should have overhang or eave dimensions between eight (8) and twenty-four (24) inches consistent with the proposed styles unless contradictory to building codes. 
iii.  For additions or renovations of existing buildings, the roof type, pitch, color, and Material should be consistent with that of the original building. 
2.6.  Windows and doors. 
i.  Generally, windows should be vertically oriented, i.e., taller than they are wide, individually articulated, and not form long horizontal or vertical bands. 
ii.  Replacement windows on existing buildings should look as similar to the original Window as possible to preserve the building's architectural design. The number, size, style and shape of window panels should be consistent with the original windows. 
iii.  Replacement doors should be of the same type as the original, or fit with the Architectural style of the building, and where applicable, original trim should remain intact. 
iv.  The use of metal security doors and externally-mounted security window bars is discouraged. 
2.7.  Materials and finishes. 
i.  In new construction, materials should be comparable to those in the neighborhood and should be appropriate to the selected architectural style of the house (i.e., stucco should not be used for a Victorian, and fish-scale shingles should not be used on a Mediterranean). 
ii.  Cladding material "palettes" should be kept simple. Generally, buildings should not have more than two (2) primary cladding materials and such materials should only be combined horizontally, with the heavier material below the lighter. 
iii.  Façade colors should be neutral or muted colors. The use of bright "primary" colors should be prohibited. Accent colors may be brighter and more intense but should harmonize with the dominant building color. 
iv.  For renovations to existing buildings, every effort should be made to maintain the original materials; however, if new siding is proposed, it should match the type and style of the original or that which is typical to the period. 
2.8.  Elevated buildings. 
i.  Foundations of elevated buildings are integral parts of the building and should be integrated with and designed to complement the design of the building. 
ii.  The placement and composition of foundation architectural elements including structural supports, screening, and other architectural elements should coincide with prominent external façade design elements including columns, posts, colonnades, trim details, or other vertical elements. 
iii.  Filling sites to more than two (2) feet above adjacent sidewalks, street grades or lots is generally discouraged. A site's finished grade should match existing topography where possible. 
iv.  The configuration and type of pedestrian access (i.e. porch, stairs, landings, ramps, and walkways) should be determined by site's required setbacks, other site features including parking and vehicular access features, and compatibility with and proximity to adjacent properties. 
v.  Non-structural, architectural screening panels or breakaway walls should be designed to match the overall architectural design of the building and piers or piles should be painted or wrapped with architectural molding or trim. 
vi.  Landscape screening should complement the architectural elements of the building and be part of an overall strategy for mitigating the effects of elevated buildings. 
(3)  Commercial projects. 
    The standards of this section apply to commercial and mixed use building project meeting the following criteria: 
New and Renovated Buildings along Commercial and Mixed Use Corridors. New construction of a building or major renovation or addition to an existing building valued greater than fifty thousand ($50,000.00) dollars intended for commercial, office, hotel/motel, or other commercial or mixed use on a property fronting on or visible from a public roadway designated as an arterial or major collector in the city's comprehensive plan. 
(a)  Design Standards. 
1.  Site design. 
1.1.  General. 
i.  All projects should ensure natural features, other site features, relationship to adjacent buildings, land uses, and street have been appropriately incorporated into the design and selection of the best location for a building or buildings on a particular site. 
ii.  Natural site amenities should be recognized. Views, trees, creeks and similar features unique to the site should be preserved and incorporated into development proposals. Such features should be considered as strong site design determinants. Disruption of existing natural features, particularly older trees, should be minimized. 
iii.  Site grade elevation changes should be limited to prevent conflicts between adjoining properties and public rights-of-way. 
1.2.  Site planning and building placement. 
i.  Projects should consider their influence on neighboring properties. Projects should be designed to contribute to the overall character, identity, and attractiveness of a neighborhood or district and minimize impacts on nearby property zoned for lower density/intensity uses. 
ii.  Pad buildings on outparcels or a portion of a main building on a site with multiple buildings should be located along street frontages to add definition to the streetscape. 
iii.  Buildings on corner sites should consider both street frontages, with precedence to the primary street. 
iv.  Buildings in the interior of large sites should be placed to form a consistent, distinct edge along interior drives and pedestrian pathways and be arranged to define public and semipublic spaces such as gardens and courtyards. 
v.  Buildings serving common purposes in multiple-family projects should be placed in a prominent location and help define public spaces, terminate vistas, and screen service drives and areas. 
1.3.  Building orientation and entries. 
i.  Buildings should be arranged along the perimeter of large sites with primary façades and entryways oriented to public streets and the intersections of major roads and site access drives. 
ii.  Primary building entries should be clearly defined and highly visible. 
iii.  For commercial buildings with multiple retail spaces, individual retail spaces on the ground floor should have their own separate entry, unless it is an interior mall entrance case, at the front of the building oriented to a street, parking area or service drive. Retail uses may have secondary entries in the rear of the building. 
iv.  Detached buildings in a multiple-family residential project or mixed use buildings with upper story residential should be located so that primary ground floor entries to units open onto landscaped patios, stoops, dooryards, or courtyards. 
v.  Separate entries for ground-floor residential units facing streets and sidewalks are encouraged. Rear and side units should have yard depths sufficient to create adequate separation from service and parking areas. 
1.4.  Fencing and screening. 
i.  Fencing materials and colors should complement the building's architectural style and utilize the prevalent materials and design for the building and the neighborhood. Materials and finishes should be durable and easily maintained. Brick, wood, stucco or wrought iron are the preferred materials. Chain link fence at the rear or storage areas at the rear of structures may be uses. 
ii.  Screening should be accomplished using materials consistent with the building façades so the visual and acoustic impacts are contained and out of view or hearing from adjacent properties and public. 
1.5.  Storage, utilities, and mechanical equipment. 
i.  Areas for outdoor storage, trash, recycling, and truck loading should be incorporated into the overall design of the building and site. 
ii.  All refuse and recycling containers should be placed within screened storage areas or enclosures that are designed consistent with current city waste management standards. 
iii.  Trash enclosures should be located remotely from project access points, building entries, public view corridors, and main circulation paths, but must be accessible to truck traffic for pick up. Enclosures should be constructed of six (6) foot high masonry walls with solid metal gates or wood gates. Enclosure finishes should match the building in color and texture and should include stonework, landscaping, wood and other natural elements. 
iv.  Elevator penthouses, HVAC units and other roof-mounted equipment should be from view of adjacent properties, roads and pedestrian areas by a parapet wall and located on the side or rear of the building(s) to limit street visibility. Mechanical penthouses and parapet walls should be designed to complement façade designs and be clad in the same materials as the façade. Where such equipment will be visible from adjacent buildings or rear parking areas, the equipment must be mounted to be as unobtrusive as possible and painted to match finish roof materials. 
1.6.  Landscaping. 
i.  Landscaping should be designed to delineate outdoor spaces, reinforce architectural themes, strengthen the sense of place of a district or corridor, screen services and parking from public view, and ease transitions among adjacent uses. 
ii.  Landscape designs should provide for clear lines of site and allow for the informal surveillance of sidewalks, pedestrian paths, public spaces, building entries, and other areas where public use is anticipated. 
iii.  Where possible, existing landscape elements should be incorporated and preserved. Healthy mature trees and tree groupings should be preserved as design determinants. Mature trees on project sites should be protected and preserved as per City of Gulfport tree preservation standards. 
iv.  Along public street frontages, landscape designs should continue or complement treatments on adjacent properties and reinforce the overall landscape character of the corridor or district. 
v.  Planting trees, shrubs, vines, and ground cover in combination with strategically placed screen walls should be used to for screening. 
vi.  Use of native, drought tolerant species is preferred. 
vii.  Automatic irrigation is preferred for all landscape areas. 
1.7.  Public spaces. 
i.  Public spaces should incorporate built and natural amenities, including water features, sun, shade, sitting areas, and landscaping. 
ii.  Public spaces should be designed to human or pedestrian scale. 
1.8.  Site and architectural lighting. 
i.  Levels of illumination should be responsive to the type and level of anticipated activity, without under or over-illuminating the area. Lighting levels should be limited to the minimum levels necessary to provide public safety. Lighting fixtures should be thoughtfully placed to avoid light spillage and glare and designed to minimize disturbances to all residential units on and off-site, on adjacent properties. 
ii.  In addition to ensuring that public safety and security are met, exterior lighting should be designed to create a comfortable and attractive pedestrian environment. 
iii.  Light standards, poles, and other fixtures should be designed as a "family" of fixtures and complement the architecture of the project and surrounding area. Lighting should be of durable and vandal-resistant materials and construction. Energy-efficient lighting should be used. Industrial style lighting, such as flood lighting or fluorescent lighting, is discouraged. 
iv.  Parking lot light fixtures should be uniform in design and provide adequate lighting for all areas. Metal halide lamps are preferred in cut-off fixtures to prevent glare and light trespass. 
v.  Walkway lighting should be scaled to the pedestrian and provide for safe passage in areas with stairs and ramps. The use of lighted bollards with incandescent or metal halide lamps or other low-level fixtures is encouraged to identify pedestrian walkways and drop-off areas at building entries. 
vi.  Architectural lighting of façades should focus on illuminating the building's surfaces. Light fixtures should include internal reflector caps, refractors, or shields that provide an efficient and focused distribution of light and avoid glare or reflection across property edges or onto adjacent buildings. 
vii.  Fixture design should complement the architecture, and be integrated into the whole of the building design. On historic buildings, fixtures should be concealed within the building's ornaments and articulations as much as possible. Lighting fixtures should be permanently fixed to the building. 
viii.  Illumination design should avoid lighting of the night sky. 
2.  Building design. 
2.1.  General. 
i.  Building design should preserve and enhance the existing community character of Gulfport, contribute to the unique sense of place of the city's neighborhoods and districts, and convey a sense of human-scale through architectural articulation, materials, and proportion. Although no single architectural style or design is preferred in the city, building designs should strive for compatibility with other buildings in their neighborhood or district. Designers should assess the architectural design, exterior building materials, colors, and arrangement of buildings and other features prior to completing design plans. 
ii.  In general, all buildings should be simple with clearly distinguished entries, and special attention given at the base of the building so as to contribute to the overall quality of street and sidewalk environments. 
iii.  Buildings should be designed to complement their context. Attempts should be made to tie the building into its district or corridor context through the use of similar massing, materials, roof form, architectural styles, or other techniques. 
iv.  Building design should encompass the whole building or set of buildings with a continuation of architectural elements, use of materials, color scheme, trim features, roof treatments, and general façade treatment. Individual buildings on the same development site should have a strong spatial and architectural relationship. All building façades should be architecturally consistent, but need not look alike. 
v.  New buildings that mimic historical styles are acceptable, but they should be accurate interpretations. Special attention should be paid to materials, proportions, and ornamentation originally used in the proposed style and should reflect the prevailing pattern of the neighborhood. 
vi.  Corporate design elements for chain businesses should be integrated into the design of the building. 
2.2.  Massing and form. 
i.  Single, large, dominant building masses should be avoided. Where large buildings are proposed, building mass should be broken up through the use of setbacks, projecting and/or recessed elements, and similar design techniques. 
2.3.  Façades and storefronts. 
i.  Façades should be articulated vertically with a base, middle and top, and articulated horizontally with a system of bays to create rhythm and variety. 
ii.  Building corners that front an important intersection, public space, or gateway should be emphasized through architectural means that address both frontages. Corner emphasis techniques may include taller building volumes at the corner, projecting building elements, chamfered corners, and applied building elements that wrap the corner. 
iii.  Ground-floor façades along streets planned for pedestrian use should be divided into a series of storefront bays with each bay typically including piers, a door, display windows, a fascia, a bulkhead, and a transom. 
iv.  The area within a storefront bay should parallel the adjacent sidewalk with part of the surface set back to form a recessed entryway. 
2.4.  Porch, awnings, and balconies. 
i.  The use of galleries, awnings, canopies, balconies and other architectural projections is encouraged. Such projections should be of appropriate design, scale, shape, color, and pattern in order to reinforce good design principles. 
ii.  Awnings should be constructed out of canvas or other similar materials and should be if a traditional, triangular profile shape, as opposed to square or rectangle. Installation of backlit awnings is discouraged. Structural supports should not be placed in public rights-of-way. 
iii.  Street-level awnings and canopies should leave eight (8) feet of vertical clearance over the sidewalk and should not interfere with street trees, streetlights, or traffic. Street-level awnings and canopies may extend horizontally over multiple windows. 
iv.  Balconies are encouraged. However, they should be attractive and architecturally incorporated into the building. Balconies should have at least ten (10) feet of clearance above the sidewalk. 
2.5.  Roofs and eaves. 
i.  Flat roofs are permissible on commercial or mixed-use buildings. Buildings with flat roofs must include a parapet surround across the entire primary façade (front elevation) as well as on both side elevations. The top of this parapet should be no less than eighteen (18) inches higher than the highest point in the roof plane. 
ii.  Cornices, shadow lines, detailed eaves, and other architectural methods should be used to add distinction and ornamentation. Commercial building roof lines should contain variations in roof lines to add interest to and reduce the scale of large-scale retail buildings, using a change in height and type to provide visual interest. 
iii.  Roof treatments should be designed to conceal flat roof lines, and rooftop equipment from view from adjacent properties and rights-of-way through use of parapet walls or sloping roof planes. 
iv.  Roof materials should be consistent with the quality of other building materials used and other roof materials used in the neighborhood and should serve a functional purpose. Appropriate roofing materials include, but are not limited to slate, concrete tile (flat with smooth or raked finish), copper, standing seam or batten metal roof (factory applied enamel finishes only), simulated wood shakes or shingles and architectural grade composition shingles. 
2.6.  Windows and doors. 
i.  High levels of ground floor transparency are encouraged along streets planned for pedestrian use. In such locations, at least fifty (50) percent of the ground floor wall area should consist of windows, arranged primarily as large storefront display windows. Glass should be clear, not reflective. 
ii.  Windows should maintain coherent and consistent rhythms, both vertically and horizontally. Upper-floor windows should be vertically oriented, or taller than they are wide. Also, each window should be individually articulated and should not form long horizontal or vertical bands. 
iii.  Windows and doors should not be flush with solid building surfaces, but rather should be recessed at least four (4) inches from the outside wall plane. 
iv.  The installation of security window bars is discouraged and should not be used on windows directly facing a street. They detract from the architectural beauty of the neighborhood and present an image of instability and fear. Security gates for storefront businesses should be located inside buildings, not outside. 
2.7.  Materials and finishes. 
i.  There should be a visual distinction between the base (ground-floor façades), middle (upper-level floors) and top of buildings. This can be accomplished by using different materials and/or colors for storefronts and upper stories. 
ii.  Predominant exterior building material surfaces should be high quality materials, including, but not limited to, architectural block, brick, concrete with an architectural finish, stucco, glass, wood, sandstone, or other native stone and tinted/textured concrete masonry units. Exterior building materials should not include unfinished or unpainted concrete panels, metal panels or smooth face concrete block. 
iii.  Storefront primary cladding materials should be brick, stone, or carved wood panels. Wood, when used, should be painted or stained. Doors should match storefront window frames, and should be made of crafted wood, stainless steel, bronze, or other ornamental metals. 
iv.  Façade colors should be neutral or muted colors. The use of bright "primary" colors should be prohibited. Accent colors may be brighter and more intense but should harmonize with the dominant building color. 
v.  For additions or renovations of existing buildings, siding and detail materials used should generally match or be consistent with the original building materials. 
2.8.  Elevated buildings. 
i.  Foundations of elevated buildings are integral parts of the building and should be integrated with and complementary to the building. 
ii.  The placement and composition of foundation architectural elements including structural supports, screening, and other architectural elements should coincide with prominent external façade design elements including columns, posts, colonnades, trim details, or other vertical elements. 
iii.  Filling sites to more than two (2) feet above adjacent sidewalks, street grades or lots is generally discouraged. A site's finished grade should match existing topography wherever possible. 
iv.  The configuration and type of pedestrian access (i.e. porch, stairs, landings, ramps, and walkways) should be determined by site's required setbacks, other site features including parking and vehicular access features, and compatibility with and proximity to adjacent properties. 
v.  Open foundations with piers or piles supporting buildings should be fitted with nonstructural, architectural screening panels or breakaway walls to match the overall architectural design of the building. At a minimum, piers or piles should be painted or wrapped with architectural molding or trim. 
vi.  Landscape screening should complement the architectural elements of the building including architectural screening and pedestrian access elements and represent part of an overall strategy for mitigating the effects of elevated buildings. 
3.  Access and parking. 
3.1.  General. 
i.  Sites should be designed to provide clearly identifiable pedestrian and vehicular access, integrate and separate the needs of pedestrians and vehicles, provide aisle circulation patterns with avoidance of dead-end aisles, and provide or address the potential of interconnection between adjacent similar uses. 
ii.  Projects should provide safe, convenient, and relatively direct pedestrian linkages with public streets and sidewalks, existing and planned transit stops, and adjacent properties of like uses. 
iii.  Separate vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems should be provided for larger projects. Pedestrian access to residential developments generally should not utilize driveways and pick-up areas. 
iv.  Pedestrian linkages between uses in commercial developments should be emphasized, including distinct pedestrian access from parking areas in large commercial developments such as shopping centers. 
3.2.  Vehicular access and circulation. 
i.  Adjacent developments should have coordinated access points whenever possible and internal and new streets should connect to existing streets or be designed to facilitate future connections to the maximum extent possible. 
ii.  Where possible, vehicular access to the site should be provided from side streets or alleys. For corner lots, access should be provided from both streets. 
iii.  Internal street systems should be required for sites containing multiple buildings. Internal streets should be designed as public streets with typical streetscape design elements, including street trees in planting strips, sidewalks, and pedestrian lighting. 
iv.  On-site vehicle circulation should be designed to discourage speeding throughout parking areas to minimize the potential conflict with pedestrians and parked vehicles. 
3.3.  Pedestrian access and walkways. 
i.  Projects should provide safe and efficient access for pedestrians to the street, public transportation systems and adjacent neighborhoods or developments. 
ii.  New developments should provide continuous pedestrian sidewalks along public rights-of-way. 
iii.  Public street sidewalks should be placed so that a minimum of six (6) feet exists between the sidewalk and back of curb to allow for streetscape planting and shading when feasible. 
iv.  In locations where insufficient public right-of-way exists to accommodate a landscape area and sidewalk, such improvements should be provided in a recorded public access easement. 
v.  Public sidewalks and parking areas should be connected to primary building entries by pedestrian walkways. 
vi.  Pedestrian crosswalks should be provided across internal drives and through parking divider islands and planting beds. 
vii.  Pedestrian walks should generally be four (4) feet in width and made of unit pavers or brush finish or sand blasted concrete and meet design standards for public sidewalks, including ADA compliancy. Painting or imprinting walkways or use of asphalt is not recommended. 
viii.  Where bicycle lanes, routes, or pathways exist or are planned, new projects should incorporate connections into the project design. 
3.4.  Parking location and design. 
i.  For commercial and mixed use projects, parking should be placed on the side or rear of buildings, screened from public view if feasible, and located to avoid conflict with pedestrian walks and truck loading or service areas. 
ii.  For large-scale commercial projects, parking lots should be distributed around the building to reduce the overall scale of the parking area and provide convenient access to the building entry. 
iii.  Parking areas should be connected to primary building entries by pedestrian walkway corridors and organized in clearly defined grouping of spaces separated by landscaping or by design components of the site or building. 
iv.  To reduce heat gain in parking areas, the use of shade trees in parking islands or along landscape buffers is required. 
v.  Parking rows should contain no more than ten (10) parking spaces uninterrupted by a landscaped island. Landscape islands should measure a minimum of eight (8) feet in width and eight (8) feet in length. 
3.5.  Drive-thru windows and service areas. 
i.  Loading and service areas for delivery or transfer of merchandise including vehicle access to those areas should be screened from public view by a combination of building design, layout, masonry walls, and dense landscaping. 
ii.  Commercial auto repair garages, tire stores, service stations, car washes, convenience stores, banks, restaurants and all types of buildings with drive-thru lanes and auto service facilities should be oriented to avoid service bays and drive-thru lanes fronting on public streets if feasible.

Sec. V. - Planned building groups. 
(A)  Policy on planned building groups. 
(1)  Purpose of provisions. Under the regulations prescribed by this appendix for the various districts, a separate site is required for each structure other than an accessory structure. For the purpose of allowing and encouraging greater variety of design and flexibility of location for buildings comprising a planned group and occupying an area of two (2) or more acres for multiple-family, condominiums, industrial, or commercial developments, or an area of fifteen (15) or more acres for a duplex development when combined with multiple-family and/or commercial developments, the provisions of this section waive the requirement for a separate building site for each building and permit two (2) or more buildings to be erected and maintained on the same building site where the planning administrator finds that certain conditions hereinafter set forth are met. Examples of such building groups that might be erected under the provisions of this section are multiple-family dwelling projects, shopping centers and senior living facilities. This section is not applicable to one-family, townhomes, or zero lot line developments. 
(2)  Option and limitations. The use of this section in connection with the development of any land or the construction of any building or group of buildings is optional with the applicant. The provisions of this section are applicable in all districts; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to permit in any district any use not permitted in that district as a use by right or with planning approval or by special exception. 
(B)  Conditions to be met by planned building groups. 
(1)  District regulations. Every building group erected and maintained under the provisions of this section shall comply with all of the regulations established by this ordinance for the district in which the building group is located except the regulation requiring a separate building site to be provided and maintained for each principal structure. Such building group may be considered as one building for the purpose of complying with the building site area, height, yard and other regulations of the ordinance; provided, however, that a building group comprised of dwellings, any one of which contains fewer than four (4) units, shall not be considered as one building but shall comply with the building site area requirements for each dwelling considered separately. With respect to residential uses, building site area per dwelling unit may be reduced not to exceed twenty (20) percent where common open space provided justifies such reduction by its location, character and intended use. 
(2)  Site plan and improvements. A planned building group shall have, and there shall be provided, the following: 
(a)  Drainage. Adequate facilities for the drainage of surface water, including storm sewers, gutters, paving, and the proper design of finished grades; 
(b)  Circulation. Adequate facilities for the safe and convenient circulation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, including walks, driveways, off-street parking areas, off-street loading areas and landscaped separation spaces between pedestrian and vehicular ways; 
(c)  Play areas. In dwelling building groups, adequate and safely located play areas for small children. 
(3)  Building spacing and access. The following building spacing and access shall be provided. Distance shall be measured between exterior walls. Minimum spacing dimensions shall not apply to corner-to-corner placement of buildings where walls do not overlap. 
(a)  Spacing of buildings. A building wall shall be located no closer to another building than a distance equal to the height of the taller building of the two (2); provided, however, that for a two-story building containing dwelling units such distance shall be not less than fifty (50) feet in the case of two (2) walls having windows and entrances, not less than thirty (30) feet in the case of two (2) walls having windows but no entrances, not less than twenty (20) feet in the case of one wall having windows and the other no windows, and not less than eight (8) feet in the case of two (2) walls having no windows; provided, further, that for buildings of more than two (2) stories, spacing shall be increased appropriately. Variations from these spacing requirements may be made by the planning commission upon a showing that the arrangement of buildings is such that the orientation insures adequate light and air, avoids undue exposure to trafficways and the parking and service areas of commercial establishments and preserves reasonable visual and audible privacy between buildings. 
(b)  Access by emergency vehicles. The buildings in a planned building group shall be so arranged that every building is accessible by emergency vehicles. 
(C)  Procedure on special plans for building groups. 
(1)  Procedure on preliminary special plan. Submission of a preliminary plan is not mandatory but is recommended as a means of identifying and solving design problems. 
(a)  Content of preliminary plan. An application for approval of a preliminary plan for a planned building group shall contain the following information: 
1.  The applicant's name, address, and interest in the application; 
2.  A site plan, which may be in sketch form, showing the land area to be occupied by the building group, its approximate dimensions, easements and rights-of-way, the relation of the building group to adjoining properties, the general layout of buildings, the arrangement of driveways, parking areas, loading areas, walks, screen planting, and other landscaping, and such additional information as may be needed to describe the proposed building group. Elevation or perspective sketches of the proposed building group may be submitted. 
(b)  Administrative examination.

Sec. VII. - Nonconforming uses and structures. 
(A)  Intent of regulations. 
(1)  Existence of nonconforming uses and structures. Within the districts established by this ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before the effective date of this ordinance or of amendment thereof, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or of future amendment. It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
Nonconforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged by attachment on a building or premises or additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved. 
As used in this section, amendment shall mean and shall be limited to an amendment by which the use of land, or structures, or of structures and premises in combination, became nonconforming or were otherwise affected. 
(2)  Construction begun prior to ordinance. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any structure on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of this ordinance or of amendment thereto and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing structure has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently. 
(B)  Nonconforming uses of land (or with minor structures only). 
(1)  Continuance. Where a lawful use of land exists on the effective date of this ordinance or of amendment thereto, which use would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this ordinance or by amendment thereto, and where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful. 
(2)  Enlargement. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the effective date of this ordinance or of amendment thereto. No additional structure not conforming to the equirements of this ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
(3)  Extension or movement. No such nonconforming use shall be extended or moved to any portion of the premises or parcel of land other than that occupied by such use on the effective date of this ordinance or of amendment thereto. 
(4)  Change in use. No such nonconforming use of land shall be changed to any other nonconforming use. 
(5)  Cessation. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than one year, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance for the district in which such land is located. 
(C)  Nonconforming structures. 
(1)  Continuance. Where a lawful structure exists on the effective date of this ordinance or of amendment thereto and which structure could not be built under the terms of this ordinance or amendment thereto by reason of restrictions on building site area, coverage, height, yards, location on the building site, or other requirements concerning the structure, the structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful. 
(2)  Enlargement. 
(a)  Commercial use structures. An existing nonconforming structure of commercial use may be enlarged provided however, that the property on which the structural enlargement is to be placed is a part of or contiguous to the existing nonconforming structure and further provided that the subject property on which the nonconforming structural extension is to be placed is owned by the owner of the nonconforming commercial structure at the date of the adoption of this ordinance. 
(b)  Residential use structures. Notwithstanding any provision of section VII to the contrary, an existing nonconforming residential structure may be enlarged or expanded, provided, however, that the property on which the structural enlargement is to be placed is a part of or contiguous to the existing nonconforming residential structure, and provided that the enlargement or expansion is not more non-conforming than the existing non-conforming structure. 
(3)  Replacement. 
(a)  Commercial use structures. Should such nonconforming structure of commercial use be destroyed or damaged by an act of God, including tornado, hurricane, flood, wind earthquake, etc., or accident or casualty, including fire or explosion not caused purposefully by the owner or tenant, the structure may be replaced or repaired. However, such replacement or repair shall be subject to the following provision: Application for a building permit must be made to the building official within one year of the time that the structure was destroyed. However, in cases of hardship the mayor and city council shall at their sole discretion have the authority to extend said one-year limitation for additional periods of time up to six (6) months each upon application of the owner or leaseholder prior to the expiration of the allowable nonconformity. 
(b)  Residential use structures. Notwithstanding any provision of section VII to the contrary, should such nonconforming residential structure be destroyed or damaged by an act of God, including tornado, hurricane, flood, wind, earthquake, etc., or accident or casualty, including fire or explosion not caused purposefully by the owner or tenant, the structure may be replaced or repaired, and may be enlarged and expanded according to paragraph (2) above. However, such replacement or repair under these circumstances shall be subject to the following provision: Application for a residential building permit must be made to the building official within two (2) years of the time that the structure was destroyed. However, in cases of hardship the mayor and city council shall at their sole discretion have the authority to extend said two-year limitation for additional periods of time up to six (6) months each upon application of the owner or leaseholder prior to the expiration of the allowable nonconformity. 
(D)  Nonconforming uses of structures (or structures and premises). 
(1)  Continuance. Where a lawful use of a structure, or of structures and premises in combination, exists on the effective date of this ordinance or of amendment thereto, which use would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this ordinance or by amendment thereto, and where such structures have a replacement cost of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or more, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful. 
(2)  Enlargement. An existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance or by amendment thereto in the district in which it is located may be enlarged provided, however, that the property on which the structural enlargement is to be placed in a part of or contiguous to the existing nonconforming structure and further provided that the subject property on which the nonconforming structural extension is to be placed is owned by the owner of the nonconforming structure at the date of the adoption of this ordinance. 
(3)  Extension. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a structure which were manifestly arranged or designed for such nonconforming use, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such structure, except as provided in item (2) above. 
(4)  Change in use. If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or of structures and premises in combination, may as a special exception be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the board of adjustment, by findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the board of adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. In any structure, or structure and premises in combination, where a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(5)  Cessation. When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for one year (except when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. However, in cases of hardship the mayor and board of commissioners shall at its discretion have the authority to extend said one-year limitations for additional periods of time upon application of the owner or leaseholders. 
(6)  Replacement. Should such nonconforming structures and premises in combination be destroyed or damaged by an act of God, including tornado, hurricane, flood, wind, earthquake, etc., or accident not caused purposefully by the owner or tenant, the structure may be replaced or required. However, such replacement or repair shall be subject to the following provision: Application for a building permit must be made to the building official within one year of the time that the structure was destroyed. However, in cases of hardship the mayor and board of commissioners shall at its discretion have the authority to extend said one-year limitations for additional periods of time upon application of the owner or leaseholder. 
(E)  Repairs and maintenance. 
(1)  Ordinary maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any twelve (12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair and replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not to exceed ten (10) percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or the portion of the structure, as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when the structure or portion thereof became nonconforming shall not be increased. 
(2)  Unsafe structures. If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
(F)  Uses requiring planning approval and special exception uses. 
(1)  Existing uses. Any lawful use existing on the effective date of this ordinance or of amendment thereto, and which would be required to have planning approval or would be a special exception use under the terms of this ordinance or amendment thereto, is without further action, conforming under these provisions. 
(2)  Authorized uses. Any lawful use which is permitted with planning approval or as a special exception use under the terms of this ordinance (other than a charge through board of adjustment action from a nonconforming use to another use not generally permitted in the district) shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district but shall, without further action, be considered a conforming use.

(5)  Schedule of fees, charges and expenses. The mayor and board of commissioners shall establish a schedule of fees, charges and expenses and a collection procedure for building permits; certificates of zoning compliance; appeals; applications for amendments; approval of special plans, planning approvals, special exceptions and other matters pertaining to this ordinance. The schedule of fees shall be posted in the office of the building official and may be altered or amended only by the mayor and board of commissioners. Until all applicable fees, charges and expenses have been paid in full, no action shall be taken on any application or appeal. 
(6)  Appeals from the planning commission. Any person or any officer, department or agency of the city aggrieved by any decision of the planning commission may within fifteen (15) days thereafter appeal therefrom to the mayor and city council by filing with the planning commission a written notice of appeal specifying the decision from which the appeal is taken. In case of such appeal, the planning commission shall cause a transcript of the proceedings in the case to be certified to the mayor and city council, and the matter will be heard on said transcripts. Within seven (7) days after filing the notice of appeal, the appellant shall estimate the cost of preparation of the record on appeal, including, but not limited to, the cost of the preparation of the transcript, and shall deposit that sum with the planning commission. The appellant shall simultaneously file with the planning commission a certificate setting forth the fact of compliance with this subparagraph and shall serve a copy of the certificate upon all other parties, upon the reporter that prepares the transcript, and upon the city clerk. 
Upon the appellant's compliance with the requirement to deposit the estimated cost of preparation of the record on appeal as set forth hereinabove, the reporter shall commence preparation of the transcript. The reporter shall acknowledge at the foot of the certificate of compliance the fact that the reporter has received it and the date on which the reporter expects to have the transcript completed and shall serve a copy of the certificate of compliance, so endorsed, on all parties, and the planning commission and the city clerk. The failure of the appellant to prepay the estimated cost of preparation of the record on appeal, including, but not limited to, the cost of preparation of the transcript, may result in a dismissal of the appeal for failure to comply with this regulation. 
When either the planning commission, on its own motion or on motion of a party, determines that dismissal may be warranted for failure to comply with this regulation, the city clerk shall give written notice to the party in default, apprising the party of the nature of the deficiency. If the party in default fails to correct the deficiency within seven (7) days after notification, the appeal shall be dismissed by the city clerk. The attorney or representative for the party in default has the burden to correct promptly any deficiency or to see that the default is corrected by the appropriate official. 
The city council shall hear the appeal no later than the second regularly scheduled city council meeting after receipt of proper documentation by the city council. 
(7)  Appeals from the city council. Appeals from any action of the mayor and board of commissioners shall be governed by any applicable statutes of the State of Mississippi.

Further, all other costs, fees and expenses, including but not limited to legal publication, photocopying, postage and other fees, shall be assessed to and paid by the party against whom the decision is made on appeal. The amount of such assessment shall be certified as to accuracy by the city clerk, and notice thereof shall be transmitted to the party against whom such assessments are made. Payments of any and all such assessments shall be due and payable upon receipt of notice. Failure to pay within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of notice shall allow the city to avail itself of all legal and/or equitable remedies for the collection of such sums. 
(B)  Board of adjustment. 
(1)  Establishment, attendance and procedure. A board of adjustment is hereby created and established. The board shall consist of seven (7) members, each appointed for a term of five (5) years by the mayor and board of commissioners. Of the members first appointed, one shall be for a term of one year, and one for a term of two (2) years, one for a term of three (3) years, two (2) for a term of four (4) years and two (2) for a term of five (5) years. Vacancies shall be filled by the mayor and board of commissioners for the unexpired term of the member affected. Faithful attendance at all meetings of the board of adjustment and conscientious performance of the duties required of the board, shall be considered a prerequisite of continuing membership. Any member who is absent for three (3) consecutive meetings and for six (6) regular meetings during any one calendar year without cause, shall automatically be removed from the board of adjustment and a subsequent new appointment will be made by the mayor and board of commissioners. 
(a)  Proceedings. The board of adjustment shall adopt rules for the conduct of its affairs and in keeping with the provisions of this ordinance. Meetings shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board may determine. The chairman, or in his absence the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the board shall be open to the public. 
(b)  Hearings; appeals; notice. Appeals to the board of adjustment concerning the interpretation or administration of this ordinance may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, or agency of the city affected by any decision of the building official. Such appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time, but not to exceed thirty (30) days, by filing with the building official and with the board of adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The building official shall transmit forthwith to the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. The board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice thereof as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. At the hearing, any person may appear in person or by agent or attorney. 
(c)  Stay of proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the building official certifies to the board of adjustment after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of record on application, on notice to the building official, and on due cause shown. 
(2)  Powers and duties. The board of adjustment shall have the following powers and duties: 
(a)  Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the building official in the enforcement of this ordinance. 
(b)  Special exceptions; conditions governing application. To hear and decide only such special exceptions as the board of adjustment is specifically authorized to pass on by the terms of this ordinance; to decide such questions as are involved in determining whether special exceptions should be granted; and to grant special exceptions with such conditions and safeguards as are appropriate under this ordinance, or to deny special exceptions when not in harmony with the purpose and intent of this ordinance. A special exception shall not be granted by the board of adjustment unless it shall find that all of the following conditions exist: 
1.  That it is empowered under the section of this ordinance described in the application to grant the special exception; 
2.  That the granting of the special exception will not adversely affect the public interest; 
3.  That specific rules governing individual special exceptions, as set out in the chart of permitted uses, have been or will be complied with; 
4.  That satisfactory provision and arrangement has been made concerning the following, where applicable: 
a.  Ingress and egress to property and proposed structures thereon with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control, and access in case of fire or catastrophe; 
b.  Off-street parking and loading areas where required, with particular attention to items in a. above and the economic, noise, glare or odor effects of the special exception on adjoining properties and properties generally in the district; 
c.  Refuse and service areas, with particular reference to the items in a. and b. above; 
d.  Utilities, with reference to locations, availability, and compatibility; 
e.  Screening and buffering with reference to type, dimensions and character; 
f.  Signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting with reference to glare, traffic safety, economic effect, and compatibility and harmony with properties in the district; 
g.  Required yards and other open space; 
h.  General compatibility with adjacent properties and other property in the district. 
5.  That the special exception will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this ordinance. 
(c)  Variances; conditions governing applications. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions and circumstances, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this ordinance shall not be granted by the board of adjustment unless it shall find that all of the following conditions exist: 
1.  That the applicant has demonstrated by written application: 
a.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; 
b.  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; 
c.  That an unnecessary hardship is created by the physical character of the property and is peculiar and unusual to such an extent that it is evidence that amendment of the zoning ordinance does not offer a reasonable solution; 
d.  That literal interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by properties in the same district under the terms of this ordinance. Among such rights commonly enjoyed is right to a reasonable economic return, but such return shall be deemed reasonable if it is equivalent to the economic return which might generally be expected in the district and shall not be based on price paid for the property by the applicant, whether or not paid in reliance on zoning, since any hardship of this kind would be self-inflicted and generally applicable to other properties in the district for which similar prices have been or might have been paid, rather than to the property of the applicant alone; 
e.  That the granting of the variance will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district, other than to permit the applicant to use his property in a manner as nearly equivalent to uses generally permitted in the district as can be allowed with appropriate protection of general public interest, and considering the peculiar and unusual conditions and circumstances involved and the hardship created by such conditions and circumstances; 
f.  That the use proposed is permissible by right or with planning approval or by special exception. With respect to the uses of land or structures, this ordinance is declared to be a definition of the public interest and intent, and the spirit of the ordinance will not be observed by any variance permitting a use not permissible by right or with planning approval or by special exception. 
No conforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district, and no permitted or nonconforming uses of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. 
2.  That the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance or of a lesser variance, and that the variance will make possible the reasonable use of the land, structure, or building, subject to the limitations set forth herein; 
3.  That the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this ordinance and will not alter or be injurious to the essential character of the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
(d)  Powers on appeal. In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the board of adjustment may, so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have the powers of the building official from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four (4) members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the building official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this ordinance, or to effect any variation in the application or this ordinance. 
(e)  One-year limitation. All special exceptions and variances, unless otherwise specified by the board of adjustment, shall be void if the project has not commenced within one year of approval. Commencement shall include securing and maintaining a building permit, certificate of occupancy or privilege license for the use specified in the application and generally conforming to the site plan as approved. Failure to continue use of the special exception or variance for a period of more than one year shall result in the special exception or variance being void; and no permit shall be issued in reliance of such approval unless the matter is resubmitted to the board of adjustment for consideration. 
(3)  Appeals from the board of adjustment. Any person or any officer, department, or agency of the city aggrieved by any decision of the board of adjustment may within fifteen (15) days thereafter appeal therefrom to the mayor and city council by filing with such board a written notice of appeal specifying the decision from which the appeal is taken. In case of such appeal, the board of adjustment shall cause a transcript of the proceedings in the case to be certified to the mayor and city council, and the matter will be heard on said transcript. 
Within seven (7) days after filing the notice of appeal, the appellant shall estimate the cost of preparation of the record on appeal, including, but not limited to, the cost of the preparation of the transcript, and upon the city clerk. 
Upon the appellant's compliance with the requirement to deposit the estimated cost of preparation of the record on appeal as set forth hereinabove, the reporter shall commence preparation of the transcript. The reporter shall acknowledge at the foot of the certificate of compliance the fact that the reporter has received it and the date on which the reporter expects to have the transcript completed and shall serve a copy of the certificate of compliance, so endorsed, on all parties, and the board of adjustment and the city clerk. The failure of the appellant to prepay the estimated cost of preparation of the record on appeal, including, but not limited to, the cost of preparation of the transcript, may result in a dismissal of the appeal for failure to comply with this regulation. 
When either the board of adjustment, on its own motion or on motion of a party, determines that dismissal may be warranted for failure to comply with this regulation, the city clerk shall give written notice to the party in default, apprising the party of the nature of the deficiency. If the party in default fails to correct the deficiency within seven (7) days after notification, the appeal shall be dismissed by the city clerk. The attorney or representative for the party in default has the burden to correct promptly any deficiency or to see that the default is corrected by the appropriate official. 
The city council shall hear the appeal no later than the second regularly scheduled city council meeting after receipt of proper documentation by the city council. 
(4)  Appeals from the city council. Appeals from any action of the mayor and board of commissioners shall be governed by applicable statutes of the State of Mississippi.

Sec. IX. - Amendments. 
(A)  Amendment policy. 
(1)  Reason for amendment. This ordinance, including the zoning map, is based on comprehensive planning studies and is intended to carry out the objective of a sound, stable and desirable environment.

(a)  Error. There is a manifest error in the ordinance; 
(b)  Change in conditions. Changed or changing conditions in a particular area, or in the city or metropolitan area generally, make an amendment to the ordinance necessary and desirable; 
(c)  Increase in need for sites. Increased or increasing needs for business or industrial sites, in addition to sites that are available, make it necessary and desirable to reclassify an area or to extend the boundaries of an existing district; 
(d)  Annexation. It is necessary and desirable to classify territory hereafter annexed to the city to a district classification; 
(e)  Ordinance changes. Amendment of the ordinance not involving a change in classification of land is necessary;

Sec. XI. - Adult entertainment businesses. 
ARTICLE I. 
PURPOSE, INTENT AND FINDINGS. 
A.  Purpose and intent. 
1.  In the development and adoption of the ordinance codified in this section, it is recognized that there are some adult business uses which have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when located in close proximity to residential neighborhoods, public parks, churches, public buildings, schools and other such similar facilities, thereby having a deleterious impact upon the public health, safety and welfare, and that such businesses frequently become places of criminality. 
2.  It has been acknowledged by communities across the nation that state and local governmental entities have a special concern in regulating the operation of such businesses under their jurisdiction to ensure those controls and regulations necessary to preserve the integrity and character of residential neighborhoods, the stability of property values, and impose restrictions and regulations upon those activities that would adversely affect property values, increase crime and violence, and prevent adverse secondary effects that will contribute to the blighting or down grading of adjacent neighborhoods. It is the secondary effects that will contribute to the blighting or down grading of adjacent neighborhoods. It is the further purpose of this Ordinance to protect the well-being of the youth of the community from objectionable operational characteristics of these adult uses by regulating and restricting their close proximity to established certain facilities such as, without limitation, churches, parks, schools and residential areas. 
3.  In recognition of the protections affording to the citizens under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, it is not the intent of this section to inhibit freedom of speech or the press. It is further the belief that just as advertising is designed to stimulate one's appetite for desiring goods or services, an overabundance or preoccupation with sexual displays or materials arouses the appetites of those so preoccupied and encourages violations of the criminal statutes involving sexual offenses and is contrary to the health and safety of the community. 
4.  The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. This section represents a balancing of the legitimate ends of the community by imposing an incidental, content-neutral place, time and manner regulation of adult entertainment businesses, without limiting alternative avenues of communication. The regulations deemed necessary to control the undesirable externalities arising from these enterprises are set forth in this section. 
5.  Neither is it the intent nor effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials. 
B.  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community in reports made available to the city's governing authorities, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Littleton, Colorado v. Z.J. Gifts D-4, LLC, 541 U.S. 774 (2004); Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002); City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000); Barnes v.

City of Dallas, Texas, 970 F2d 82 (5th Cir. 1992); and N.W. Enterprises v. City of Houston, 352 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2003), as well as studies conducted in other cities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Beaumont, Texas; and findings reported in the Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986), the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On the Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all of which are fully adopted and incorporated herein, the city's governing authorities (the mayor and city council) make and identify the following nonexhaustive findings: 
1.  Adult entertainment businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
2.  Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where adult entertainment businesses are located. 
3.  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at adult entertainment businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
4.  Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. 
5.  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other adult entertainment businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such adult entertainment businesses. 
6.  At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in adult entertainment businesses including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections. 
7.  As of 2007, the total number of reported cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was one million, eighteen thousand, four hundred twenty-eight (1,018,428). 
8.  In the year of 2007 there were three hundred fifty-two (352) reported new cases of AIDS and HIV infected individuals in the state. 
9.  The total number of cases of genital chlamydia trachomatis infections in the United States reported in 1997 was five hundred twenty-six thousand, six hundred fifty-three (526,653), an eight (8) percent increase over the year 1996. 
10.  The total number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported during the twelve-year period 1985-1997 was three hundred eighty-seven thousand, two hundred thirty-three (387,233). 
11.  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with a total of one million, nine hundred one thousand, three hundred sixty-five (1,901,365) cases reported during the period 1993-1997. 
12.  The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
13.  According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
14.  Sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
15.  Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids, including semen and urine, are found in the areas of adult entertainment businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. 
16.  Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity. 
17.  Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug dealing and drug use. 
18.  The findings noted in paragraphs numbered 1. through 17. raise substantial governmental concerns and requires immediate attention to protect the public health and safety. 
19.  Adult entertainment businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
20.  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of adult entertainment businesses. Further, such licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that the adult entertainment business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult entertainment business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
21.  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments. 
22.  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the adult entertainment business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity. 
23.  It is desirable, in the prevention of crime and the spread of communicable diseases, to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this Ordinance is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
24.  The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment business license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this section. 
25.  The barring of such individuals from operation or employment in adult entertainment businesses for a period of five (5) years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to further criminal conduct, and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
26.  The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by enactment of this section.

Sec. XII. - Rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers. 
(A)  Purpose and intent. 
(1)  In the development and adoption of this Ordinance, it is recognized that rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers, as such terms are defined herein, can and do have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when located in close proximity to residential neighborhoods, public parks, churches, public buildings, schools and other such similar facilities, thereby having a deleterious impact upon the public health, safety and welfare, and that such businesses frequently become places of criminality and bring crime to an area. 
(2)  It has been acknowledged by communities across the nation that state and local governmental entities have a special concern in regulating the operation of such businesses under their jurisdiction to ensure those controls and regulations necessary to preserve the integrity and character of residential neighborhoods, the stability of property values, and impose restrictions and regulations upon those activities that would adversely affect property values, increase crime and violence, and prevent adverse secondary effects that will contribute to the blighting or down grading of adjacent neighborhoods. It is the secondary effects that will contribute to the blighting or down grading of adjacent neighborhoods. It is the further purpose of this Ordinance to protect the well-being of the citizens of the community from objectionable operational characteristics of these clinics by regulating and restricting their close proximity to established certain facilities such as, without limitation, churches, parks, schools and residential areas. 
(3)  It is not the intent of this Ordinance to inhibit the operation of these clinics or centers or to inhibit the availability of opiod medication to those to whom it is legally prescribed or to inhibit the ability of persons to sell plasma legally. 
(4)  The provisions of this Ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the ability of one who has been legally prescribed opiod medication to obtain those medications or the ability of one who desires to sell his/her plasma. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this Ordinance to restrict or deny access to opiod medication by those for whom opiod medication has been prescribed or to restrict or deny access to a location where plasma may be sold legally. This Ordinance represents a balancing of the legitimate ends of the community by imposing an incidental, content-neutral place, time and manner regulation of rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers. The regulations deemed necessary to control the undesirable externalities arising from these businesses are set forth in this Ordinance. 
(5)  Neither is it the intent nor effect of this Ordinance to condone or legitimize the distribution, sale or consumption of opiod medications illegally. 
(B)  Definitions. 
    Misdemeanor means that upon conviction a fine not more than one thousand dollars ($1000.00) and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ninety (90) days shall be imposed at the discretion of the municipal court.

    Plasma donation center means any business, operation, or activity that has as its primary function the acceptance of donations of human plasma. 
    Premises means the real property upon which the rehabilitation health clinic or plasma center is located, and all appurtenances thereto and buildings thereon, including, but not limited to, the rehabilitation health clinic or plasma center, the grounds, private walkways, and parking lots and/or parking garages adjacent thereto, under the ownership, control, or supervision of the licensee, as described in the application for a business license. 
    Rehabilitation health clinic means any business, operation, or activity that has as its primary function the sale, delivery or provision of opiod medication as a means of rehabilitation from drug addiction. Hereinafter, rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers are referred to collectively as "clinic" or "center". 
(C)  Zoning regulations. 
(1)  Nonconforming uses. Any rehabilitation health clinic or plasma center lawfully operating on the effective date of this Ordinance that is in violation of the location or other requirements of this Ordinance shall be deemed a nonconforming use. Such nonconforming uses shall not be increased, enlarged, extended or altered except that the use may be changed to a conforming use. If two or more clinics are within one thousand (1,000) feet of one another and otherwise in a permissible location, the clinic that was first established and continually operated at a particular location is the conforming use and the later-established business/es is/are nonconforming. 
(2)  Location restrictions. Rehabilitation health clinics and plasma centers, as defined herein, shall be permitted in I-1 and I-2 by special exception approval provided that: 
(a)  Clinics may not be operated within one thousand (1,000) feet of

ARTICLE 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. A. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Mississippi has in Title 17, Chapter 1, Mississippi Code of 1972 Annotated delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and City Council of the City of Gulfport does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
( Ord. No. 2929, Art. 1, § A, 12-19-17 ) 
Sec. B. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The City of Gulfport is subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions, both inside and outside the identified special flood hazard areas, causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
( Ord. No. 2929, Art. 1, § B, 12-19-17 ) 
Sec. C. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage, and; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
( Ord. No. 2929, Art. 1, § C, 12-19-17 ) 
Sec. D. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this ordinance are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and; 
(7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood-prone area. 
( Ord. No. 2929, Art. 1, § D, 12-19-17 ) 
Sec. E. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
(4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage, and; 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
( Ord. No. 2929, Art. 1, § E, 12-19-17 )

    Community means any state or area or political subdivision thereof, or any Indian tribe or authorized tribal organization or authorized native organization which has the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain regulations for the areas within its jurisdiction. For purposes of this Ordinance, community, when referenced herein, shall be the City of Gulfport, Mississippi. 
    Community floodplain management map means any map produced by the community utilizing best available base flood elevation and floodway data that is from a federal, state, or other accepted technical source. 
    Community rating system (CRS) is a program developed by the Federal Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding. 
    Community flood hazard area (CFHA) is an area that has been determined by the floodplain administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified community official) from available technical studies, historical information, and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. This includes areas downstream from dams. 
    Critical facility (also called critical action) means facilities for which the effects of even a slight chance of flooding would be too great. The minimum floodplain of concern for critical facilities is the 0.2 percent chance flood level. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to facilities critical to the health and safety of the public such as: emergency operations centers, designated public shelters, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vital data storage centers, power generation and water and other utilities (including related infrastructure such as principal points of utility systems) and installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste (as defined under the Clean Water Act and other federal statutes and regulations). 
    D Zone is an area in which the flood hazard is undetermined. 
    Dam is any artificial barrier, including appurtenant works, constructed to impound or divert water, waste water, liquid borne materials, or solids that may flow if saturated.

    Elevation certificate is a FEMA form used as a certified statement that verifies a building's elevation information. 
    Emergency program means the first phase under which a community participates in the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance coverage for all insurable buildings in that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM. 
    Enclosures below the lowest floor : See "Lowest Floor." 
    Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
    Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management) . This order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative. 
    Executive Order 11990 (Wetlands Protection) . This order requires the avoidance of adverse impacts associated with the destruction or modification of wetlands. 
    Existing construction means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before date of January 1, 1975. Existing construction may also be referred to as existing structures. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision includes the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Fill means a deposit of earthen materials placed by artificial means. 
    Five-Hundred Year Flood means the flood that has a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 0.2 percent chance flood have a moderate risk of flooding. 
    Flood or flooding means: 
a.)  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
1.)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
2.)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
3.)  Mudslides (i.e. mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in paragraph a.)2.) of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
b.)  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in paragraph a.)1.) of this definition 
    Flood (insurance definition) means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two (2) or more acres of normally dry land areas or of two (2) or more properties (e.g. a building and a public street) from (1) overflow of inland or tidal waters (2) unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters (3) mudflows caused by flooding. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) is the document which provides an examination, evaluation, and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation, and determination of mudslide and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by flood waters from any source. 
    Floodplain Administrator is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this ordinance and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    Flood-proofing certificate is an official FEMA form used to certify compliance for non-residential structures in non coastal high hazard areas as an alternative to elevating buildings to or above the base flood elevation. 
    Floodway : See "Regulatory Floodway." 
    Floodway fringe means that area of the special flood hazard area on either side of the regulatory floodway. 
    Flood protection elevation is the base flood elevation plus the community freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator plus freeboard. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, ship building and ship repair facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacturing facilities, processing functions, sales, administrative functions, or service facilities. 
    Hardship (as related to variances of this ordinance) means the exceptional difficulty that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Hazard potential means the possible adverse incremental consequences that result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or mis-operation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of a dam does not reflect in any way on the current condition of a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g. safety, structural integrity, and flood routing capacity). 
    High hazard dam means a class of dam in which failure may cause loss of life, serious damage to residential, industrial, or commercial buildings; or damage to, or disruption of, important public utilities or transportation facilities such as major highways or railroads. Dams which meet the statutory thresholds for regulation that are proposed for construction in established or proposed residential, commercial, or industrial areas will be assigned this classification, unless the applicant provides convincing evidence to the contrary. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a building. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
a.)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
b.)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
c.)  Individually listed on the State of Mississippi inventory of historic structures, or; 
d.)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior. 
    Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analyses means the analyses performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Mississippi, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations and /or floodway boundaries. 
    Increased cost of compliance (ICC) coverage means under the standard flood insurance policy the cost to repair a substantially flood damaged building that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a substantially damaged building into compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are flood-proofing (nonresidential), relocation, elevation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, include ICC coverage. 
    Letter of map change (LOMC) is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. 
    Letter of map amendment (LOMA) 
    An amendment based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA, was not elevated by fill (only by a natural grade elevation), and will not be inundated by the one percent chance flood. A LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is not located in a SFHA. 
    Letter of map revision (LOMR)

( Ord. No. 2929, Art. 5, § A, 12-19-17 ) 
Sec. B. - Specific standards for riverine zones. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard designated on the community's FIRM, where base flood elevation data have been provided (excluding CHHA and Coastal AE Zone), as set forth in article 3, section B, the following provisions, in addition to the standards of article 5, section A, are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential building (including manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls of enclosures that are subject to flooding, shall be provided in accordance with standards of article 5, section B(4). 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential building (including manufactured building) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Buildings located in all A Zones may, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the building below the base flood elevation plus a minimum of one (1) foot of freeboard are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. Dry flood-proofing is allowed only where flood velocities are less than or equal to five (5) feet per second. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. A Flood Emergency Operation Plan and an Inspection and Maintenance Plan must be provided by the design professional for the building. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  In special flood hazard areas with base flood elevations (AE Zones) but without floodways, no encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be permitted unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification must be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
(4)  Enclosures . New construction and substantial improvements that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Enclosed areas, including crawl spaces, shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, and storage. 
a.)  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following criteria: 
(i)  Provide a minimum of two openings, on different sides of each enclosed area; if a structure has more than one (1) enclosed area below the base flood elevation, each shall have openings on exterior walls; 
(ii)  The total net area of all openings shall be at least one (1) square inch for each square foot of enclosed area, or the openings shall be designed and the construction documents shall include a statement that the design and installation will provide for equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters; 
(iii)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher than the exterior grade); 
(iv)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions and automatically equalize hydrostatic flood loads on exterior walls, and; 
b.)  Access to the enclosed area shall be minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and, 
c.)  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms. 
(5)  Detached storage buildings, sheds, or other like accessory improvements, shall solely be used for parking of vehicles and storage. Such storage space shall not be used for human habitation and shall be limited to storage of items that can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood damage potential. The storage space shall be constructed of flood resistant or breakaway materials, and equipment and service utilities, such as electrical outlets, shall be limited to essential lighting and other incidental uses, and must be elevated or flood-proofed. Flood openings in accordance with the standards of article 5, section B(4) shall also be required. These accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters. Accessory improvements and other appurtenant structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement that may result in damage to other structures. 
(6)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
a.)  All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, in existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in new manufactured home parks or subdivisions or in substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring and the flood openings requirements of article 5, section B(4). 
Manufactured homes must be: 
(i)  Elevated on a permanent foundation to have its lowest floor elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, and; 
(ii)  Securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.)  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved, excepting manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that: 
(i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation support system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement, or 
(ii)  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above the highest adjacent grade and adequately anchored foundation support system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.)  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
(i)  Be on site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days and; 
(ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or 
(iii)  Must meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation requirements of this article 5, section B(6)a.) or article 5, section B(6)(b)(i) above. 
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed and insured in accordance with the State of Mississippi Motor Vehicle Regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions. 
(7)  Floodways . Located within areas of special flood hazard adopted by reference in article 3, section B, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity and depth of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.)  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during occurrence of the base flood discharge; 
b.)  If article 5, section B(7)a.) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood damage prevention standards of Article 5. 
c.)  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of article 5, section A(2), and the standards of article 5, and the encroachment standards of this article 5, section B(6)a.), are met. 
( Ord. No. 2929, Art. 5, § B, 12-19-17 ) 
Sec. C. - Standards for streams without base flood elevations and floodways. 
    When base flood elevation data and floodway data are not available in accordance with article 3, section A, in special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established by the community. The following provisions in addition to the standards of article 5 section A and the enclosure standards of article 5 section B(4) shall apply:

(2)  The floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of article 5. When such data are available, standards of article 5, section B, shall apply. If data is not available from article 5, section C(1) or outside sources, then the following provisions shall apply. 
(3)  No encroachments, including fill material or other development, shall be located within a distance of the stream bank equal to five (5) times the width of the stream at the top of the bank or twenty (20) feet each side from the top of the bank, whichever is greater, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The enclosure standards of article 5, section B (4) shall apply. 
(4)  The floodplain administrator shall require that a single lot applicant develop the base flood elevation for the development site, utilizing accepted engineering practices and procedures. Upon review of the submitted data, the administrator may accept or reject the proposed base flood elevation. When such data is accepted, standards of article 5, section B, shall apply. 
(5)  Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Office prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such notifications to FEMA. Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained. 
(6)  Require that all manufactured homes be placed or installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. Manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Dry stacked blocks (stacked without the use of mortar or cement to bond them together) are not allowed within the special flood hazard area.

Sec. F. - Coastal high hazard areas. 
(1)  Located within areas of special flood hazard areas established in article 3, section B (maps) are coastal high hazard areas, designated as VE Zones. These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from wave action due to hurricanes, tsunamis, or other seismic sources. The following provisions, in addition to the standards of article 5, sections A, B, C, and D, except for B(7), shall also apply: 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements in VE Zones shall be elevated on pilings or columns so that: 
a.)  The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor, excluding the pilings or columns, is elevated a minimum of one (1) foot or one (1) foot above the centerline of the street, whichever is greater, and; 
b.)  The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those requirements by state or local building codes.

(5)  All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide. 
(6)  All new construction and substantial improvements in VE Zones shall have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood latticework, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten (10) and no more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of twenty (20) pounds per square foot, either by design or when so required by local codes, may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions: 
a.)  Breakaway wall collapse shall result from water load less than that which would occur during the base flood, and; 
b.)  The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components, structural and nonstructural. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those requirements by state or local building codes. The lowest horizontal structural member should be oriented perpendicular to the expected wave crest. 
(7)  If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be useable solely for storage, parking of vehicles, or building access. Such space shall not be used for human habitation and finished or portioned into separate rooms. 
(8)  Enclosures below elevated buildings shall be useable solely for storage, parking of vehicles, or building access. Such space will not be used for human habitation and not finished or partitioned into separate rooms. 
(9)  Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings. Under the buildings or structures, no fill may be used except for minor site grading for drainage purposes. Nonstructural fill may be used on coastal building sites for minor landscaping and site grading for drainage purposes as long as the fill does not interfere with the free passage of floodwaters and debris underneath the building or cause changes in flow direction during coastal storms such that will cause additional damage to buildings on the site or to any adjacent buildings. Certification by a professional engineer or architect shall be submitted along with design calculations demonstrating that no adverse impacts will result. 
(10)  Prohibit man-made alteration of sand dunes that would increase potential flood damage. 
(11)  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within VE Zones on the Community's FIRM on site: 
a.)  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, 
b.)  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision, 
c.)  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or 
d.)  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood; 
e.)  Shall meet the standards of this article 5, section F and that manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on other sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with VE Zones on the FIRM meet the requirements of article 5, section B(6). 
(12)  All new structures shall be located on the lot so as to minimize exposure to coastal hazards and shoreline erosion, Structures shall be located outside the coastal high hazard area, to the greatest extent possible. 
(13)  Recreational vehicles placed on sites within VE Zones on the Community's FIRM either; 
a.)  Be permitted before being placed on site and be on site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days and shall leave the site and obtain a new permit before returning to the same site, and; 
b.)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions, or; 
c.)  Meet the requirements of article 5, section F(1) through (10) and (12). 
( Ord. No. 2929, Art. 5, § F, 12-19-17 ) 
Sec. G. - Critical facilities. 
    Construction of new and substantially improved critical facilities shall be located outside the limits of the special flood hazard area (one (1) percent chance floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA only if no feasible alternative site is available and access to the facilities remains available during a 0.2 percent chance flood. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated three feet six inches (3'6") above the base flood elevation at the site (or to the 0.2 percent chance flood elevation whichever is greater). Flood-proofing and sealing measures must be implemented to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Multiple access routes, elevated to or above the 0.2 percent flood elevation, shall be provided to all critical facilities to the maximum extent possible. Critical facilities must not only be protected to or above the 0.2 percent chance flood, but must remain operable during such an event. The community's flood response plan must list facilities considered critical in a flood, since loss of access can cause a critical situation. Other facilities in low risk flood zones that may also be needed to support flood response efforts must be included on the critical facility list. The use of any structure shall not be changed to a critical facility, where such a change in use will render the new critical facility out of conformance with this section. The list of the operators of the critical facilities affected by flooding must be updated at least annually, as part of the community critical facility planning procedures.

c.  Within a Community Planning Area delineated by and subject to an Existing-Community Plan which has been adopted by the City through proper planning process in accordance with state law, the applicability of this Code and of the requirements of the Community Plan shall be determined by the terms of the Community Plan itself. This Code and the requirements of the Community Plan may be made mandatory throughout the entirety of the Community Planning Area; or this Code and the requirements of the Community Plan may be optional over the entirety of the Community Planning Area, available for invocation by lot or by district as provided in the Community Plan; or may be mandatory within certain districts within the Community Planning Area and optional in other parts of the Community Planning Area. Where this Code and the Community Plan are to be optionally available, the Community Plan must specify the districts by which this Code may be invoked and by what means the election to invoke this Code shall be made. 
d.  Within a Community Planning Area subject to an Existing-Community Plan which has been adopted by the City through proper planning process in accordance with state law, in any district where this Code is optional and owners of property in such district do not elect to invoke this Code in accordance with the methods specified in the Community Plan, the Existing Local Codes shall be applicable in all respects within such districts, rather than this Code. 
e.  Within a Community Planning Area subject to an Existing-Community Plan which has been adopted by the City through proper planning process in accordance with state law, in any district where this Code is optional and owners of property in such district elect this Code to be applicable in accordance with the methods specified in the Community Plan, or in any district where this Code is made mandatory by the Community Plan, the provisions of Articles 1, 5, 6, and 7 of this Code and the requirements of the Community Plan shall be applicable and mandatory in all respects.

Thereafter any use or structure modifications made to such lots shall be subject to this Code and to the corresponding Community Plan, without option of resort to the Existing Local Codes as alternative, this Code and the Community Plan thereby becoming mandatory for that lot. The Existing Local Codes shall continue to be applicable to issues not covered by this Code except where the Existing Local Codes would be in conflict with the Intent Section 1.2, in which case the conflict shall be resolved in favor of this Code.

1.3.6 All tables, illustrations, and appendices of this Code are an integral part hereof to the extent provided herein. 
1.4 - PROCESS 
1.4.1 Sectors (defined geographically in Article 2), if applicable and designated by a Sector Plan adopted under Article 2 hereof, contain Communities (defined by extent and intensity in Articles 3 and 4. Communities are comprised of Transect Zones (defined by the elements appropriate to them in Article 5 and in Article 6 Standards & Tables). 
1.4.2 The geographic determination of Sectors and the standards for each Transect Zone shall be determined through a process of public hearing and consultation in compliance with Mississippi state law notice requirements with a recommendation from the City of Gulfport Planning Commission (the "Planning Commission") and approval by the Mayor and City Council. Once these determinations have been incorporated into this Code and the associated plans, projects that require no Variances or Warrants according to the provisions of this Code shall be processed administratively without further recourse to public consultation except as required by this Code. Warrants granted and justified as defined by this Code shall not be considered to amend or in any respect to modify this Code or the Existing Local Codes. 
1.4.3 The Mayor and City Council of the City of Gulfport shall appoint a Planning Official of the City of Gulfport ("Planning Official") for the purpose of administering and enforcing this Code. Approval decisions about plans submitted under this Code shall be made by a Consolidated Review Committee (CRC). The CRC shall expedite the permitting process by providing a single interface between the owner or developer and the requisite approval authorities. 
a.  The CRC shall include representatives of the Planning Office, Building Code Services, the Department of Engineering, Public Works, the City Arborist, a representative of the City's Historical Commission if one exists, and the Fire Department, and representatives from any other regulatory authority within the City that has jurisdiction over the permitting of a project. 
b.  In addition the CRC shall include a representative of the Urban Design Center (UDC); the City Architect or his agent; the City Transportation Planner if one has been appointed; a Ward Representative from each ward of the City, designated according to 1.4.3c; and a Community Representative, designated according to 1.4.3d, from every Represented Community in the City. 
c.  A Ward Representative to the CRC from each ward shall be appointed by the Mayor from a list of candidates recommended by the Council member representing that ward, and confirmed by the City Council. 
d.  Residents of any Community Planning Area subject to an Official Community. Plan may petition the Mayor and City Council for representation on the CRC. If so petitioned the Council member or members representing the ward or wards containing the Community Planning Area shall nominate a resident of the Community Planning Area to act as Community Representative for that Community Planning Area to the CRC, with approval by the Mayor and City Council. The Community Planning Area thereby becomes a Represented Community. Delay or failure to appoint and confirm a nominated Community Representative shall not abate the consideration of matters requiring CRC approval. 
e.  CRC meetings shall be announced at least five days in advance to all members of the CRC, regardless of whether a project requiring their presence is to be evaluated. 
f.  Final decisions on applications for a site by the CRC shall require at a minimum evaluation from all applicable regulatory authorities within the City and consensus of the Planning Official, City Architect or his agent, UDC representative if an Urban Design Center has been created or designated, Ward Representative(s) for the ward(s) containing the proposed development, and Community Representative(s) of Represented Communities containing or adjacent to the proposed project if such Community Representatives have been appointed, that the application complies with the requirements of this Code and of the relevant Official Community Plan(s). 
g.  The CRC and its members shall abide by the requirements, allowances, and intent of this Code. 
1.4.4 An owner or developer may appeal a decision of the CRC to the City of Gulfport Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals (the "Zoning Board"); and may appeal decisions of the Zoning Board or the Planning Commission to the City Council in the manner required by Existing Local Codes; and a final decision of the City Council may be appealed to the court of jurisdiction according to Mississippi state law. 
1.4.5 Should a violation of an approved plan occur during construction, any of the Building Official, Planning Official, or Mayor shall have the authority to require the developer to stop, remove, and/or mitigate the violation, or to require the owner or developer to secure a justifiable Warrant or Variance to cover the violation.

1.4.7 The Planning Official shall keep a Notification List of names and mailing addresses of persons or organizations requesting to be notified before any public hearing relating to zoning or planning; and shall provide notice by mail to such persons, postmarked no less than 15 days in advance of any public hearing. 
a.  Any person or organization who so requests of the Planning Official shall have his name and mailing address added to the Notification List. 
b.  Names may be removed from the Notification List at the written request of the named person or organization, or on notice to the Planning Official by the Post Office that mail cannot be delivered to the listed address, or after 3 (three) years if the Planning Official provides warning of removal from the list by mail 30 days before such removal and the named person or organization does not post written objection before the designated date of such removal. 
1.4.8 An accurate log of applications submitted for CRC review or hearing shall be made available for routine inspection by the public, and shall include the applicant, subject site, date, and type of review or hearing. Such log shall be updated daily and shall include final disposition for completed applications submitted over at least the previous six-month period in addition to all pending applications. 
1.4.9 Fees for the various administrative applications and reviews associated with implementation of this Code shall be set by the Mayor and City Council. 
1.5 - WARRANTS AND VARIANCES 
1.5.1 There shall be two levels of approval for deviation from the requirements of this Code: Warrants and Variances. For deviations not designated in this Code as being permitted by Warrant, permitted by Variance, or forbidden, whether such a deviation requires a Warrant or a Variance, or is forbidden, shall be determined by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may from time to time issue guidance to the CRC concerning which deviations may be Warranted and which require Variance, with approval of the City Attorney for such guidance. 
1.5.2 A Warrant is a ruling that would permit a practice that is not consistent with a specific provision of this Code but is justified by its Intent (Section 1.2). The CRC shall have the authority to administratively approve or disapprove a request for a Warrant. 
1.5.3 A Variance is any ruling that permits a deviation which is not Warrantable, but is in harmony with the overall intent of the Code in light of unique conditions of a site. Variances from the requirements of this Code shall be granted only in accordance with the following procedure: 
a.  An application for a SmartCode Variance shall be submitted to the Planning Official. 
b.  The Planning Official shall refer the application for SmartCode Variance to the City Attorney, to the Board of Zoning Appeals, and to the Planning Commission. 
c.  The Planning Official shall determine in conjunction with the Office of the City Attorney whether the requested SmartCode Variance is barred by this Code, and shall notify the Zoning Board and the Planning Commission of their finding. Either the Planning Official or the City Attorney shall certify that the Variance is prohibited if they so find, and shall notify the applicant that the request for Variance is denied. If the Variance request is so denied because it is certified to be barred or prohibited by this Code, the denial may be appealed directly to the Circuit Court as provided by state law. 
d.  If the Variance is not certified as barred or prohibited by this Code within fourteen (14) days after it is submitted to the Planning Official, the Planning Office shall schedule a hearing before the Zoning Board of the application for Variance. The Zoning Board shall determine whether the applicant has demonstrated that a variance is justified by showing that 
1.  Special conditions exist, peculiar to the land or structure involved but not to others in the same zoning classification, which preclude the property's meeting the requirements of this Code; 
2.  Such special conditions are not the result of actions of the applicant; 
3.  An unnecessary hardship is created by the peculiar and unusual physical character of the property; 
4.  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this Code would deprive the applicant of rights enjoyed by other property owners in the same district; and 
5.  Granting the Variance will not bestow any special privilege on the applicant that is denied to other property owners in the identical zoning classification. 
e.  If the Zoning Board determines as above that the SmartCode Variance is justified, the Planning Official shall schedule a hearing of the application for Variance before the Planning Commission, which shall then determine whether the granting of the Variance as proposed would be injurious to the public welfare or detrimental to the welfare of the Community or contrary to the requirements of the Comprehensive Plan, and shall determine whether some lesser variance, rezoning, or other solution could mitigate the hardship while preserving the public and Community welfare and fulfilling the intent of this Code. 
f.  If the SmartCode Variance is not certified by the Planning Official or City Attorney to be barred or prohibited (see provision c above), and if the Zoning Board finds that the requested Variance is justified (see provision d above), and if the Planning Commission approves the Variance according to the conditions of provision e above, or approves only a lesser or modified Variance from that requested, then the requested Variance or the approved lesser or modified Variance, as the case may be, shall be granted. Failure of the Variance application to win approval in any of the above required processes shall constitute denial of the Variance. 
g.  Denial of a requested SmartCode Variance by the Zoning Board or by the Planning Commission is appealable to the Mayor and City Council, and if denied by the Mayor and City Council, is appealable to the Circuit Court as provided by state law. 
1.5.4 A request for a Variance shall not subject the entire application to public hearing, but only that portion necessary to rule on the issue under consideration. A request from the CRC to the Planning Commission for a ruling about the Warrantability of a deviation shall only subject that portion of the application necessary for such a ruling to examination by the Planning Commission. 
1.5.5 The following standards and requirements shall not be available for Warrants or Variances: 
a.  The allocation ratios of each Transect Zone. 
b.  The maximum dimensions of traffic lanes. 
c.  The required provision of Rear Alleys and Rear Lanes. 
d.  The minimum Residential Densities. 
e.  The permission to build Ancillary Dwelling Units. 
f.  The requirements on the specific location of any required parking spaces. 
g.  The prohibition of cul-de-sacs and unconnected Thoroughfares in Community Plans where no physical site feature requires such. 
1.6 - INCENTIVES 
1.6.1 To encourage the use of this Code, the following incentives shall be granted to the extent authorized by state law: 
a.  Applications submitted under this Code shall be handled through expedited process as described herein and in compliance with state law. 
b.  Applications submitted under this Code shall be processed with priority over others under the Existing Local Codes with prior filing dates. 
c.  Review fees may be waived or reduced in accordance with the provisions of the adopting ordinance, or other schedule of fees adopted by the Mayor and City Council. 
d.  Density may be increased by Density Transfer consistent with the provisions of this Code. 
e.  The City shall accept for dedication and maintain those internal Thoroughfares that through-connect to adjacent sites and any publicly dedicated Service Alleys or Service Lanes included in an approved New Community Plan or Infill Plan. 
1.7 - MISCELLANEOUS PROCEDURES 
1.7.1  Affordable Housing. Affordable Housing requirements in this Code shall be managed in part through the following procedures: 
1.7.1.1  Approved Affordable Housing Providers. The Planning Official in conjunction with the Office of the City Attorney shall designate, create and maintain a publicly available list of Approved Affordable Housing Providers (AAHPs). In order to be so designated and included on this list, an organization shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  The organization shall be recognized by the United States Department of Treasury's Internal Revenue Service as a tax-exempt non-profit organization. 
b.  The organization's stated purpose as set forth in its charter shall include increasing the provision of affordable housing within all or part of the City of Gulfport, MS. 
c.  The organization agrees it will certify to the City as Affordable Housing units only properties within its control which are compliant with the terms of Section 1.7.1.4. 
d.  If the organization is a Community Land Trust, the City Attorney and the Planning Official shall have approved the organization's deed restriction terms and buyer qualification requirements as being sufficient in combination with the organization's land lease policy to reasonably maintain the likelihood of affordability of the unit for at least 30 years, and the organization shall agree to sell Certified Affordable Housing units provided as part of any agreement with the City only to buyers qualified according to the requirements of such agreement for the first five years after creation of such housing units. Thereafter sale may be to any buyer qualified according to the organization's usual policy. 
e.  If the organization is an Affordable Housing Trust, City Attorney and the Planning Official shall have approved the organization's operating policies, and the organization shall have agreed to annually report the compliance of every Certified Affordable Housing unit it provides as part of any agreement with the City with the rent and the resident qualification requirements of such agreements for a period of at least 30 years, or to donate the property to another Approved Affordable Housing Provider if the organization fails to maintain the required affordability on any Certified unit for a total of more than 8 months in any ten year period within that 30 year term of Certification. 
f.  The organization shall submit an application to the Planning Office attesting to its satisfaction of these requirements, and providing such other reasonable information as shall be deemed relevant by the Planning Official and City Attorney. 
g.  The Planning Official or City Attorney shall not have previously removed the organization from the list of Approved Affordable Housing Providers, unless whatever conditions which led to the removal of such organization shall have been addressed to the satisfaction of both the City Attorney and the Planning Official. 
1.7.1.2  Probation and Removal. The Planning Official shall regularly inspect the list of Approved Affordable Housing Providers, shall determine a probationary period for any organization added to the list and for any organization which has failed to meet the terms of its agreements with the City in a timely manner. An AAHP may be required to forfeit any properties acquired during its probation to another AAHP or to a public housing authority at the City's demand. The Planning Official and City Attorney shall rescind the designation of AAHP and remove from the list of Approved Affordable Housing Providers any organization which has misrepresented its compliance with agreements made with the City for provision of Certified Affordable Housing, or which the Planning Official and City Attorney agree has failed to abide by such agreements in good faith or to significantly correct such failures within a period of one year from the date on which the City has notified the organization of such failures. 
1.7.1.3  Affordable Housing Agreements. The City may enter into an Affordable Housing Agreement with an AAHP or with a public housing authority in conjunction with a developer, land owner, or builder for the creation of a specified number of Certified Affordable Housing units as part of a requirement for increase of allowed Density for a New Community through Density Transfer in accordance with Article 3, or as part of a Density Bonus program in accordance with Article 5. No AAHP shall be required to enter into any such an agreement in order to retain its status as an AAHP. The Planning Official shall keep a record of all Certified Affordable Housing units created as part of Affordable Housing Agreements, and any such unit may be counted as part of at most one Affordable Housing Agreement. The responsibility of the AAHP or public housing authority in such an Agreement with the City shall be to certify the management for affordability of the units according to 1.7.1.4 below; production of such units shall be the responsibility of the developer, land owner, or builder, with the exception that in a case where the AAHP guarantees production of such Certified Affordable Housing units with pre-existing units, not part of any previous Affordable Housing Agreement, owned or controlled by the AAHP, in such case the AAHP shall be held responsible for production of the required units, and after three years from the date of the Agreement if any required units remain unbuilt, the Planning Official shall claim the number of unbuilt units from those offered by the AAHP as guarantee as part of the Affordable Housing Agreement, and shall record such units as having been part of the original Agreement, and such units shall not be eligible for use as part of any such future Agreement. 
1.7.1.4  Certification of Affordable Housing units. A Certified Affordable Housing unit is defined to be an Independent Residential Housing unit certified to the City by an AAHP or public housing authority to be under the control or ownership of the AAHP or the public housing authority and to satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The unit shall be managed in order to assure continuing affordability for at least 30 years from the date of certification. 
b.  If the unit is to be sold, the certifying AAHP shall be a Community Land Trust, and the first buyer of the unit shall be income-qualified to purchase Affordable Housing, with gross household income of no more than either of 80% of Area Median Income or of 100% of Area Median Income, as specified in the certification, for a household of size suitable for the unit in question. 
c.  If the unit is to be sold, the purchase cost for the first sale of the unit, including mortgage, amortization, taxes, insurance, and condominium or association fees, if any, shall constitute no greater than 30% of either of 80% of Area Median Income or of 100% of Area Median Income, as specified in the certification. 
d.  If the unit is to be rented, the certifier shall be an Affordable Housing Trust with AAHP status or shall be a public housing authority; and the lessee shall be income-qualified annually to rent Affordable Housing, with gross household income of no more than either of 80% of Area Median Income or of 100% of Area Median Income, as specified in the certification, for a household of size suitable for the unit in question. 
e.  If the unit is to be rented, the lease price for the unit shall constitute no more than 30% of either of 80% of Area Median Income or of 100% of Area Median Income, as specified in the certification. 
f.  A certified unit may at any time during the 30-year term of the certification be transferred to another AAHP for continued management subject to the affordability requirements of the original certification. A rental unit held or transferred to a Community Land Trust with AAHP status may be sold at any time subject to the original buyer-qualification and affordability requirements of the original certification. 
g.  A Certified Affordable Housing Unit within a designated Unbundled Parking Area on the applicable Official Community Plan may include an offer of a single parking space for lease at an annual cost of 3% of either of 80% of Area Median Income or of 100% of Area Median Income, as specified in the certification. 
1.7.2  Density Bonuses. Density Bonuses shall be managed by the following procedures: 
1.7.2.1 Certificates of Density Bonus shall be issued by the Planning Official in conjunction with the Office of the City Attorney to a developer, builder, or property owner having met the requirements of some Density Bonus program specified by this Code; each such Certificate shall be uniquely identified, shall indicate the specific lot or parcel through which the Bonus was generated, under what program the Bonus was generated, the number of Equivalent Housing Units awarded for the Bonus, whether the Bonus is transferable to a site other than the one from which it was generated, and shall specifically identify the fulfilled requirements of the Density Bonus program for which the bonus has been issued, and shall specify the date of expiration of such Certificate. 
1.7.2.2 Density Bonuses shall be valid for no more than ten years from date of issue. Within that period proof of Density Bonus shall be submitted with any application which makes use of such Bonus. No less than one-half unit of a Density Bonus may be redeemed at one time. The Planning Office shall keep records of all redeemed Density Bonuses and of the lots and parcels on which the Bonus is redeemed, and shall check each Bonus Certificate submitted for redemption against the list of previously redeemed Bonuses. Each fractional or whole redemption shall be recorded permanently on the Density Bonus Certificate. 
1.7.2.3 The Planning Official shall keep a record of all issued Density Bonuses, including indication of status as to redemption, lots and parcels where the Bonuses were redeemed, and any other facts necessary to the seamless administration of the Density Bonus programs described in this Code. The Planning Official shall annually compile a list of Density Bonuses issued and of structures constructed during the year with Density Bonuses, including tax parcel numbers and street addresses, and shall make such list available publicly. 
1.7.2.4 A Density Bonus shall not attach permanently to a lot or parcel. A Density Bonus Certificate may only be redeemed before its expiration for the permitting of a structure consistent with the requirements of the original Density Bonus program. Any structure completed using a Density Bonus shall not be considered non-conforming with the SmartCode and the Official Community Plan if it is otherwise compliant, and a Certificate of SmartCode Compliance may be issued for the structure. Such a structure may be added to or modified in Function. However, if the Function Volume associated with such a structure is increased after the expiration of the Density Bonus on which its original construction depended, that Density Bonus may not be counted for the purpose of figuring the compliance of the structure with the Density requirements of this Code after the increase in Function Volume. 
1.7.2.5 Density Bonuses shall be issued only after completion of all the requirements specified in the awarding Density Bonus program. However, in the case of Density Bonus programs requiring construction of Affordable Housing, the Bonus may be issued before completion of the required housing units under one or more of the following conditions: 
a.  All incomplete Certified Affordable Housing units required for the Density Bonus award are guaranteed by pre-existing Certified Affordable Housing units pledged and held by an AAHP which is party to the corresponding Affordable Housing Agreement with the City; and the land required for the required new units has been secured and is in possession of the AAHP. The units acting as guarantee may not have been produced in fulfillment of any Affordable Housing Agreement with the City, and may not be included as guarantee units in any other incomplete Affordable Housing Agreement during the period during which such units act as guarantee. Guarantee units need not be located in accordance with the requirements of the Affordable Housing Agreement for which they act as guarantee, nor do they in any way lessen the requirement for production of units required by the Affordable Housing Agreement. In the event that the required Certified Affordable Housing units have not been completed within three (3) years of the initial date of the Affordable Housing Agreement, the Planning Official shall record the pledged guarantee units as fulfilling the AAHP's requirement for certification of the unfinished units, but the developer, builder, or land owner shall nevertheless be obligated to complete the construction of the unfinished units. 
b.  Developer, builder, or land owner agrees in writing that no certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any structure depending in whole or in part on the awarded Density Bonus until all required Certified Affordable Housing units have either been completed, inspected, and received certificates of occupancy, or all incomplete such units are guaranteed by pre-existing Certified Affordable Housing units pledged by an AAHP. Land required for construction of the required units in the required locations shall be in possession of the AAHP before any Bonus may be awarded. Developer, builder, or land owner further agrees that until such certificate of occupancy is issued, the structure(s) shall remain unoccupied and in violation of zoning requirements. 
1.7.3  Density Transfers. Attachment and vacation of Density Rights shall be managed according to the following provisions. 
1.7.3.1  Sending and Receiving Areas. Density Transfer Sending Areas shall be determined by Official Community Plans, and by the Sector Plan for the City, if one has been adopted, in compliance with one of the Density Transfer programs described in this Code. Density Transfer Receiving Areas shall be determined by Official Community Plans, and by the Sector Plan for the City, if one has been adopted. 
1.7.3.2  Transaction Types and Procedures. Density Transfer transactions shall be conducted according to the specific type of transaction: 
a.  Building-Scale Density Transfer transactions shall require the vacation of Density Rights for the Density Donor lot or parcel according the requirements of 1.7.3.3 below, and shall additionally require the attachment of the detached Density Allowance from the Donor to the Density Recipient lot or parcel according to the requirements of 1.7.3.4 below. 
b.  Community-Scale Density Transfer transactions shall require the vacation of Density Rights from a Density Donor lot or parcel according to the requirements of 1.7.3.3 below and shall additionally require the disbursement of the extinguished Density Allowance throughout a New Community Plan in accordance with Article 3. 
c.  Alternatively the Density Rights extracted from a Density Donor in a Density Transfer transaction may be represented by a Certificate of Detached Density Rights prepared by the Planning Official in conjunction with the Office of the City Attorney in accordance with the requirements of 1.7.3.5 below. Such a Certificate may then be used at any later date to effectively replace the Density Donor site in a Density Transfer transaction, the extracted Density Rights being transferred from the Certificate to the Density Recipient site. 
1.7.3.3  Vacation of Density Rights. When Density Rights are extracted from a Donor lot or parcel as part of a Density Transfer, the Density Rights shall be permanently vacated from such lot or parcel according to the following procedure: 
a.  Application for Density Extraction shall be submitted to the Planning Office by the owner of the Density Donor property, along with a warranty deed and such additional documentation as the Planning Official shall deem necessary. The Planning Office shall determine the eligibility of the Donor property for the Density Transfer by determining whether the property lies within a Sending Area designated by an Official Community Plan or Sector Plan, whether the property meets the requirements of the designating Plan for the Sending Area, and whether the Density Rights have previously been extracted from the property. If the Donor property is designated as part of a Linked Sending Group of lots or parcels, the Planning Office shall determine that no other property within the Linked Sending Group has already had its Density Rights vacated. 
b.  The Planning Office shall determine the By-Right Density Allowance of the lot or parcel, or the Effective Density Allowance of the lot or parcel if it is part of an O-2 Sector Sending Area. For this purpose the Planning Office may require that the property owner submit a survey of the lot or parcel. 
c.  If the Donor property has been found to be eligible for Density Transfer, the Planning Official may issue a Notice of Intent to Extract Density Rights to the property owner acknowledging the eligibility, specifying the By-Right or Effective Density Allowance of the property, and describing requirements for completing the extraction, including the removal of any structures which would be non-conforming after the completion of the density extraction. 
d.  For a Donor lot or parcel which is part of a designated Conservation Density Transfer Sending Area, Density Rights shall be extinguished on the Donor property by the owner's granting of a perpetual conservation easement to an Approved Conservation Trust by deed restriction. The deed restriction shall prohibit any structures on the lot or parcel. Public access requirements shall be as specified by the designating Community or Sector Plan; public access shall not be required if unspecified by the designation plan. The deed restriction shall meet such other requirements as are set forth for the Conservation Density Transfer program in Articles 2, 4, and 5, and shall be of a form which has been approved by the City Attorney. 
e.  For a Donor lot or parcel which is part of a designated Civic Space Density Transfer Sending Area, Density Rights shall be extinguished on the Donor property by the owner's granting of a perpetual conservation easement to an Approved Conservation Trust by deed restriction. The deed restriction may permit a single structure for public restroom facilities, but shall otherwise prohibit all structures on the lot or parcel. The deed restriction shall explicitly permit unlimited public access. The deed restriction shall meet such other requirements as are set forth for the Civic Space Density Transfer program in Articles 4 and 5, and shall be of a form which has been approved by the City Attorney. The lot or parcel may further be dedicated to the City, but such dedication shall not be required. 
f.  For a Donor lot or parcel which is part of a designated Transit Grid Reserve Density Transfer Sending Area, Density Rights shall be extinguished on the Donor property by the owner's granting of a perpetual conservation easement to an Approved Conservation Trust by deed restriction. The deed restriction shall prohibit construction of any structures on the lot or parcel other than those related to the provision of public transit, and shall provide for the future use of the lot by the City for public right of way for any of public transit, a pedestrian or bike path, or a Thoroughfare. The deed restriction shall meet such other requirements as are set forth for the Transit Grid Reserve Density Transfer program in Articles 2, 4, and 5, and shall be of a form which has been approved by the City Attorney. If no Approved Conservation Trust can be found which will accept the required deed restriction terms, the lot or parcel may be instead dedicated to the City and deed restricted to public transit or public street usage. 
g.  For a Donor lot or parcel which is part of a designated Density Recovery Transfer Sending Area, the required Donor area shall be subdivided from the original lot or parcel and dedicated to the City for public use. The Donor property shall be deed restricted to the use for which the Density Recovery Transfer is granted. The deed restriction shall meet such other requirements as are set forth for the Density Recovery Transfer program in Articles 4 and 5, and shall be of a form which has been approved by the City Attorney. 
h.  After execution of the required deed restrictions, the Planning Office shall confirm that the restriction has been properly recorded. After such confirmation is obtained, the Planning Office shall attach the extracted Density Rights from the Donor property to a Density Recipient lot or parcel designated by the Donor property owner, or shall provide to the owner of the Donor property a Certificate of Detached Density Rights representing the extracted Density Allowance of the Donor property, as indicated on the Application for Density Extraction. Before the transfer is executed or the Certificate is issued, the Planning Office shall verify that no structures remain on the Donor property. 
i.  Density Donor properties shall, within one (1) year of having Density Rights extracted, be rezoned by the Planning Office according to the requirements of the particular Density Transfer program which designated the Sending Area of which the Donor property is a part. The Planning Office shall keep a record of all Donor properties from which Density Rights have been vacated so that a permanent development ban may be enforced. 
1.7.3.4  Attachment of Density Rights. Density Rights extracted from a Density Donor lot or parcel may be immediately transferred to Density Recipient lots or parcels, or may be transferred by way of a Certificate of Detached Density Rights. The procedure for attachment of Density Rights depends upon whether the intended Recipients are lots or parcels within designated Receiving Areas of Official Community Plans (Building-Scale Density Transfer) or entire Transect Zones which are part of a New Community Plan (Community-Scale Density Transfer); in any case the authenticity of the Density Rights to be transferred, whether directly from a Sending Area or by Certificate of Detached Density Rights, shall be verified by the Planning Office. 
a.  Building-Scale Density Transfer. A covenant between the City and the owner of the Recipient lot or parcel, running with the land, shall be executed and recorded specifying the amount and origin of the transferred Density Rights, and committing the City to recognize the addition of transferred Density Rights in perpetuity. Such covenant shall be of a form approved by the City Attorney. 
b.  Community-Scale Density Transfer. Certificates of Detached Density Rights representing the extracted Density Rights of Donors shall be referenced in any New Community Plan submitted for adoption in which Density Transfers are utilized. The transferred Density Rights shall be attached by means of increased Transect Zone density limits in accordance with Article 3, and the density increases for each Transect Zone resulting from the attachment shall be specified in the New Community Plan. If the developer of the New Community so requests, the City shall agree to the execution and recording of covenants specifying the increase of density by transfer for each Transect Zone and committing the City to recognize the addition of such transferred Density Rights in perpetuity. Such covenant shall be of a form approved by the City Attorney. 
1.7.3.5  Certificates of Detached Density Rights. Ownership of Density Rights extracted from a Density Donor may be retained indefinitely apart from the lot or parcel where they originated in the form of a Certificate of Detached Density Rights. There shall be no time limit for the redemption of Detached Density Rights, but re-attachment to a Density Recipient property shall require the provision of a valid Certificate and corroboration in the form of a deed restriction on the original Density Donor lot or parcel consistent with such Certificate. Certificates of Detached Density Rights shall include at a minimum the following information and requirements: 
a.  A unique identifier. 
b.  The date of extraction of Density Rights from the original Donor property. 
c.  A description uniquely identifying the Donor lot or parcel. 
d.  The area of the Donor parcel, and the By-Right or Effective Density Allowance extracted from the parcel, signifying the redeemable value of the Certificate. 
e.  The legal name of the owner of the Donor lot or parcel at the date of extraction. 
f.  The written signatures of the City Attorney and Planning Official on the date of extraction. 
g.  The written signature or mark of the owner of the Donor lot or parcel at the date of extraction. 
h.  A designated block of text, providing a description of the transaction including items a through e above, which is authenticated through a means of public-key encryption by the Planning Official and the City Attorney, whose public keys shall be kept on record by the Planning Office indefinitely. 
Issued Certificates shall also meet any other requirements deemed reasonable by the City Attorney or Planning Official in order to assure provable authenticity. The Planning Office shall maintain a secure record of all such Certificates issued and redeemed, and of the associated properties involved in issuance and redemption. The Planning Official and City Attorney shall establish and make available for public description procedures for the transfer of ownership of Certificates of Detached Density Rights. A single Certificate of Detached Density Rights may be exchanged for multiple Certificates representing in total the density value of the original Certificate; the resulting Certificates shall be required to include in addition to the above information the authenticated text block from the original Certificate. 
1.7.3.6  Approved Conservation Trusts. The Planning Official shall maintain a publicly available list of Approved Conservation Trusts which meet the requirements of the City for acceptance and enforcement of conservation easements to facilitate enforcement of vacated Density Rights. In order to be designated as an Approved Conservation Trust, an organization shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  The organization shall be recognized by the United States Department of Treasury's Internal Revenue Service as a tax-exempt non-profit organization. 
b.  The stated primary purpose of the organization as set forth in its charter shall include conservation of land, open space, green space, or ecology in an area which includes the City of Gulfport, MS. 
c.  The organization shall have previously been granted conservation easements to protect land within the State of Mississippi. 
d.  In cases where land owners arrange with the organization for the vacation of Density Rights for lots or parcels in order to implement Density Transfers under this Code, the organization shall have agreed to employ deed restrictions in order to secure perpetual conservation easements which the City Attorney has approved as sufficiently security the required prohibition of development intended by this Code for vacated Density Donor properties. 
e.  The organization has agreed to name the City as a secondary or tertiary enforcer of conservation easements for properties vacated of Density Rights for the purpose of Density Transfer under this Code. 
f.  The Mayor and City Council have approved the designation of the organization as an Approved Conservation Trust. 
1.7.3.7 The Planning Official or the City Attorney may establish such other reasonable procedural requirements as they see fit to assure the integrity of the Density Transfer process and the authenticity of Detached Density Rights Certificates. 
1.7.3.8 The Mayor and City Council may establish by ordinance a schedule of fees for the administration and processing of Density Transfers and for the issuance of Certificates of Detached Density Rights. 
1.8 - PRE-EXISTING AND POST-EMERGENCY CONDITIONS 
1.8.1  Damage Due to Emergency Conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained or implied herein, if a building, structure, or other improvement is damaged or destroyed by any event resulting in the declaration of an emergency or disaster applicable to the City by the Mayor and City Council, the owner of record on the date of the event may repair or rebuild such building, structure or other improvement on the same building site and with the same building footprint by right. To qualify, the building, structure, or other improvement must have been legally permitted to have been built under this or other Codes, or have legally existed as a non-conforming building, structure, or other improvement prior to the causative event; neither the lot, use, building, improvement, structure nor condition shall be added to or altered in any way, except to remedy the effects of such damage or destruction, unless such additions or alterations cause the lot, use, building, improvement, structure or condition to conform more closely with the provisions of this Code; and permits for repair or replacement of such buildings, structures, or improvements shall have been issued within one (1) year of the causative event. 
1.8.2  Pre-Existing Non-Conformity. Without limiting the foregoing, any lot, parcel, use, building, improvement, structure or condition subject to an Official Community Plan under this Code that lawfully existed upon the adoption by the Mayor and City Council of that Community Plan shall be allowed to continue, and may be repaired to such pre-existing condition, provided that such lot, use, building, improvement, structure or condition may not be changed or added to after such date, except to conform more closely with the provisions of this Code, and provided that the use is not changed to another use prohibited by law. If the non-conforming use, condition, or feature ceases for a period in excess of one (1) year before either permitting is granted and reconstruction or repair commences or the use is resumed, the subsequent use, condition, or construction shall be fully compliant with this Code. 
1.9 - SUCCESSION 
1.9.1  Succession. Ten years after the approval is granted for a Community Plan, and every ten years thereafter, at the request of residents or property owners within the Community Planning Area, each Transact (sic) Zone, except the T1 Natural and the T2 Rural, shall be considered for rezoning in whole or in part to the successional (next higher numbered) Transect Zone through public consultation and at the recommendation of the Planning Commission through public hearing after 15 days advance published notice, and by approval of the Mayor and City Council. 
(Ord. No. 2600, § 2, 8-19-08)

Transfer of such property to private ownership shall automatically subject it to the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(Ord. No. 2674, § 1, 5-4-10) 
ARTICLE 2. - SECTOR-SCALE PLANS 

2.1 - GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 
2.1.1 Sector Plans shall integrate the largest practical geographic area, overlapping property lines as necessary and municipal boundaries to the extent that the adjacent City or County can legally implement such Sector Plans. 
2.1.2 If requested by the Mayor and City Council, Sector Plans shall be prepared by the Planning Commission or, at the discretion of the Mayor and City Council, by consultants under its supervision, or, if requested by the Planning Commission, by the Planning Office. The process shall involve citizen participation and shall require consideration by the Planning Commission in public hearing after fifteen (15) days' public notice in compliance with state law; upon receipt of a recommendation and record from the Planning Commission, the Mayor and City Council shall approve or modify such Plan, or shall remand it to the Planning Commission for further consideration. 
2.1.3 The areas to be designated Preserved Open Sector (O-1) shall be mapped using the criteria listed in Section 2.3. The outline of this Sector is effectively the Rural Boundary Line (RBL), which is permanent. All other Sectors may qualify for development but conditional to the requirements of Sections 2.1.4 through 2.1.9. 
2.1.4 The areas to be designated Reserved Open Sector (O-2) shall be mapped using the criteria listed in Section 2.4. The boundary between this Sector and any adjacent Sectors G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 is effectively the Urban Boundary Line (UBL), which is to be adjusted by the permitting of Community Plans according to this Code. 
2.1.5 To the extent permitted under applicable state law, the City shall establish and administer a Conservation Density Transfer program and a Transit Grid Reserve Density Transfer program for the gradual transfer of development rights from the Reserved Open Sectors (O-2) to the G-2 and G-3 Growth Sectors and to select areas in the G-4 Infill Growth Sector. Conservation and Transit Grid Reserve Density Transfers shall be available to exceed the allocated densities of the New Communities (Section 3.4 and Table 14B) and to exceed the allowed buildable densities for designated areas of the Existing Communities within prescribed limits. The Reserve Sectors (O-2), which comprise Conservation Density Transfer Sending Areas and Transit Grid Reserve Density Transfer Sending Areas, thereby become part of the Preserve Sectors (O-1). Transit Grid Reserve Sending Areas (Future Transportation Corridors) included in the Reserve Sector (O-2) shall be explicitly designated on the Sector Plan. The Planning Office shall maintain a record of all such transfers from either Density Transfer program, updating the Sector map accordingly, and shall not permit development of parcels within the Preserve Sectors (O-1). Specific lots and parcels within Growth Sector G-4 may also be designated as Conservation Density Transfer Sending Areas or Transit Grid Reserve Density Transfer Sending Areas as part of an Official Community Plan if they are judged to correspond to the criteria of Section 2.3 or 2.4, to merit preservation for the betterment of the Community. On extraction of Density Rights such parcels shall be designated as Transect Zone T1, but shall not be included in the Reserve Sector (O-2). 
2.1.6 Infill Growth Sectors (G-4) shall be mapped as described in Section 2.8. These areas may be redeveloped according to Article 4 of this Code. 
2.1.7 Where transit service is planned or available, Regional Center Developments (RCD) shall be re-designated as Transit-Oriented Developments (TOD). 
2.1.8 Those areas that are justified for specialized uses but cannot or should not conform to one of the six Transect Zones shall be allocated to Special Districts (SD). 
2.1.9 All remaining areas are available for development as New Communities conditional to Article 3 of this Code. These areas shall be assigned to one of the three Growth Sectors G-1, G-2, and G-3 by factoring the existing zoning, the metropolitan transportation plans, parcel size and other criteria determined through a process of citizen participation, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 hereof. Within these Growth Sectors, the corresponding Community Types of CLD (Conservation Land Development), TND (Traditional Neighborhood Development), and RCD (Regional Center Development), shall be permitted by right, to the extent set forth in Table 2.

2.4.3 To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Reserved Open Sector is a Conservation Density Transfer Sending Area, except for areas explicitly designated as Transit Grid Reserve Density Transfer Sending Areas; all of the Reserve Open Sector is available for the gradual transfer of development rights to New and Existing Communities in the four Growth Sectors. The Density Rights shall be available to be used to exceed the allocated Densities of the New Communities (Section 3.4 and Table 14B), and to increase buildable density limits of designated areas in Existing Communities. Areas where the Density Rights have been extracted from the Reserved Open Sector become integral to the Preserved Open Sector. 
2.4.4 Within the Reserved Open Sector, the Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) is subject to adjustment as New Community Plans are permitted. 
2.5 - (G-1) RESTRICTED GROWTH SECTOR 
2.5.1 The Restricted Growth Sector shall be assigned to areas that have value as open space but nevertheless are subject to development, either because the zoning has already been granted or because there is no legally defensible reason, in the long term, to deny it.

2.9.2 The provisions of the Existing Local Codes shall remain solely applicable to Special Districts, unless and until the standards and conditions of development for such Special Districts shall be determined in public hearing of the Mayor and City Council. Property owners within a Special District may submit to the City a Redevelopment Community Plan for consideration. Such a Plan shall comply generally with the requirements of a New Community Plan under Article 3 with the exception of minimum size requirements, and may be adopted by the City in accordance with the requirements of Section 1.4.6 for New Community Plans. 
2.9.3 The standards and conditions determined for Special Districts shall be recorded on Table 15. 
ARTICLE 3. - NEW COMMUNITY SCALE PLANS 

3.1 - GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 
3.1.1 Article 3 shall be available as an option for development by right pursuant to the requirements set forth in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. The Existing Local Codes also shall remain available by right, except in certain districts of the City where by proper planning process in accordance with state law this Code is made mandatory. Though available as an option, once invoked in accordance with Section 3.12, this Article shall be applied in its entirety. 
3.1.2 Incentives for the use of this Code are listed in Section 1.6. 
3.1.3 New Community Plans may be prepared by or on behalf of an owner or developer, or on behalf of the Planning Commission. 
3.1.4 New Communities of the Types corresponding to the appropriate Sectors, if applicable, which are planned according to the provisions of this Code shall be approved through an expedited process combining rezoning and plat approval, to the extent possible under applicable law as described in Section 3.12. 
3.1.5 The owner or developer may request a New Community Type other than one that is allowed by the designated Sector on the Sector Map, if applicable, through the rezoning process. 
3.1.6 If a Sector Plan is adopted pursuant to Article 2 hereof, Growth Sectors G-1, G-2 and G-3 (described in Article 2) designate the potential geographic locations of three Types of New Communities: Conservation Land Development (CLD), Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) and Regional Centers (RCD) or Transit-Oriented Development (TOD). These Community Types are prescribed in Section 3.3. If a Sector Plan has not been adopted, the extent to which any of the three Types of New Communities may be developed in a given location shall be subject to determination by the CRC in accordance with the limitations of Section 3.3. Each New Community Plan shall clearly indicate which Type of New Community is proposed under the Plan. 
3.1.7 Each New Community Plan shall respond to the existing conditions of the site, to adjacent developments, to connecting Thoroughfares, to natural features and to man-made Traces, as determined by the CRC.

3.2.2 Transect Zones shall be laid out within a New Community Plan so that zone boundaries do not lie along Thoroughfares with the exception of Service Alleys and Lanes, except by Warrant, so that Facades of one Transect Zone generally face Facades of the same zone. 
3.3 - COMMUNITY TYPES 
Conservation Land Development (CLD) 
3.3.1  a.  A Hamlet or Conservation Land Development (CLD) may be permitted at the discretion of the CRC with approval of the Planning Commission in rural areas of the City; provided, however, that if a Sector Plan has been adopted under Article 2 hereof, CLDs shall be permitted by Right within the G-1 Restricted Growth Sector and with Planning Commission approval within O-2 Reserved Open Sector. 
b.  A Conservation Land Development (CLD) shall consist of no more than one standard Pedestrian Shed (1/4 mile radius) including T2, T3 and T4 Zones in the areal proportions specified in Table 14A. The developed area (T3 and T4 Zones) shall include a minimum of 10 acres but not more than 40 acres, and an area equal to or greater than that of the developed area shall be permanently allocated to Natural and Rural Zones (T1 & T2) to provide a natural conservation buffer. 
3.3.2 Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) 
a.  Traditional Neighborhood Developments (TNDs) shall be permitted by right throughout the City for New Community Plans of at least 80 contiguous acres for Greenfield, and of at least 40 contiguous acres in infill areas, except for those parts of the City designated as Open, Reserved, Preserved or protected space, or zoned as Special District on the Sector map; provided, however, that if a Sector Plan has been adopted under Article 2 hereof, TNDs shall be permitted by right only within the G-2 Controlled Growth Sector, the G-3 Intended Growth Sector, and the G-4 Infill Growth Sector. The simultaneous planning of larger and adjacent parcels is encouraged.

An RCD shall be limited to one Long Pedestrian Shed (1/2 mile radius) including T4, T5, and T6 Zones in areal proportions as specified in Table 14A, and may be adjoined without buffers by one or several partial or entire Standard Pedestrian Sheds, each with the individual Transect Zone requirements of a TND as specified in Tables 2 and 14A. 
d.  An RCD shall only be located in the vicinity of important existing or planned intersections of major Thoroughfares. 
3.3.4 Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) 
An RCD that is on an existing or projected transit network shall be redesignated as a TOD and allowed the additional Density shown in Table 14A and calculated in accordance with Section 3.4. 
3.4 - DENSITY REQUIREMENTS 
3.4.1 The Developable Areas of the site shall be considered the Net Site Area. The Net Site Area shall be allocated to the various Transect Zones according to the parameters specified in Table 14A for the type of New Community being developed. 
3.4.2 The initial Density Allocation for the area of each Transect Zone shall be calculated in terms of Equivalent Housing Units (EHU) in accordance with the Gross Equivalent Density limits of Table 14B. For the purposes of Gross Equivalent Density calculations, the Transect Zone areas include the Thoroughfares but not land allocated to Civic Functions. The By-Right Density Allocation for a Transect Zone is then the Gross Area mapped to that Zone multiplied by the By-Right Gross Equivalent Density limit for that Zone from Table 14B. 
3.4.3 The Density Allocation for a Transect Zone may be increased by the use of Community-Scale Density Transfers, up to the effective By-Transfer Gross Equivalent Density limit specified for each Zone by Table 14B. For each Transect Zone district with Density Allocation so increased, no less than fifteen percent (15%) of the increase by Density Transfer shall be designated for Affordable Housing accessible to buyers at the 100% AMI level, to be distributed throughout such district.

The Maximum Building-Scale Densities for Transect Zones T4L through T6 shall be designated as part of the New Community Plan. Maximum Building-Scale Density for Zone T3 is always one (1) EHU per lot, independent of the area of the lot. Maximum Building-Scale Densities shall be uniform across all instances of a given Transect Zone within a New Community Plan. 
3.4.7 Community-Scale Density Transfers may be used to transfer by-right density from any O-2 Reserve Sector area or from any parcels or lots designated in the corresponding Official Community Plan as a Density Sending Area to one or more Transect Zones within the New Community Plan in accordance with Table 14B. 
3.4.8 A New Community Plan shall not designate lots, parcels, or portions of lots or parcels as Density Sending Areas. Areas to be preserved should be zoned accordingly. 
3.4.9 A New Community Plan may designate Receiving Areas for building-scale Density Transfers and for building-scale Density Bonuses in accordance with Section 4.4. If any such Receiving Areas are designated or anticipated for the future, the New Community Plan shall establish Absolute Maximum Building-Scale Densities and Additional Height Allowance guidance for each Transect Zone in accordance with Section 4.4, and in such a way that the By-Transfer Gross Equivalent Density limits of Table 14B are not exceeded in any Transect Zone district.

e.  On rejection by the Planning Commission, an applicant may resubmit the application after making changes, or may appeal the rejection. On resubmission the CRC shall only be required to address changes made to the application in its review, and the change review and original review shall both be submitted to the Planning Commission with the application for a second public hearing. 
f.  On acceptance the Planning Commission shall notify the applicant in writing of its decision, including any conditions of acceptance. In the case of conditional acceptance, the Commission shall also specify changes required, the character and extent of required improvements, and the amount of the surety bond which will be required in lieu of the completion of required improvements. 
g.  On acceptance by the Planning Commission, the applicant shall be given 30 days to accept or deny the Commission's decision. If the applicant accepts, the Community Planning Area described in the submitted application shall be designated on the City's official zoning map as a SmartCode Planning Area, and the land owner shall be deemed to have elected to exercise the SmartCode zoning option. Once the applicant has agreed in writing to accept the designation, the Community Planning Area shall be mandatorily subject to this Code. Existing Local Codes shall apply within such Community Planning Area only to the extent that they do not conflict with this Code. 
3.12.4  New Community Plan Adoption Hearing. After completion of the New Community Plan, the applicant may submit the plan with final plat for adoption. 
a.  A New Community Plan shall first be submitted for review by CRC. The CRC shall check for compliance of the plan with this Code, request clarifications, and respond to applications for Warrant.

A copy of the final assessment shall be provided to the applicant. 
b.  The applicant may at any time after requesting final assessment from the CRC submit the New Community Plan for adoption hearing. Public notice shall be given consistent with Section 1.4.7 and with state law; owners of property within 160 feet of the site shall be notified by mail, and public hearing shall be held before the Planning Commission. Planning Commission shall review and make recommendation to the Mayor and City Council for acceptance, may refuse approval, or may conditionally recommend approval contingent on specific changes. If rejected the applicant may appeal to the Mayor and City Council, or may rework and resubmit to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall communicate its decision in writing, along with any reason(s) for disapproval, to the Mayor and City Council and to the applicant. The Planning Office may rely on a list provided and certified to by an applicant, or as shown by the latest tax assessor's records of property owners and mailing addresses within 160 feet for mailing purposes. Notice by publication according to state law shall be mandatory to approval. 
c.  On a recommendation of acceptance by the Planning Commission, the Mayor and City Council shall approve or disapprove adoption of a New Community Plan. Adoption of a New Community Plan includes acceptance of the final plat and approval of the final rezoning described in the approved Community Plan. 
d.  Failure on the part of the applicant to have the final plat recorded in the records of the chancery clerk within ninety (90) days after the date of approval unless granted an extension by Mayor and City Council shall render the approval of the New Community Plan and the associated final plat null and void. 
e.  Submission requirements for a New Community Plan adoption hearing shall be as per Section 3.12.6, and shall include such other reasonable requirements as the Planning Office shall establish. 
f.  On successful adoption by the City, a New Community Plan shall be incorporated by reference into the official zoning map of the City of Gulfport as an Official Community Plan, and shall act as the governing document for land use within the designated Community Planning Area in conjunction with this Code.

Until such rezoning is complete, zoning for each Transect Zone shall remain unchanged. 
ARTICLE 4. - INFILL COMMUNITY SCALE PLANS 

4.1 - GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 
4.1.1 This Article pertains to areas within the G-4 Infill Growth Sectors of the Sector Plan (Article 2), or in the absence of a Sector Plan, to areas including or surrounded by substantial pre-existing development as determined by the CRC and the Planning Commission. In such areas further development shall be guided by adoption of Existing-Community Plans through proper planning process, in compliance with state law. Such Existing-Community Plans for a designated area may be prepared, at the request of the Mayor and City Council or of the Planning Commission, by the Planning Office or by a planner selected by the Planning Commission with approval by the Mayor and City Council. Such Existing-Community Plans may also be prepared for a designated area at the request of and on behalf of residents and property owners of that area by a planner of their choosing at their expense. All Existing-Community Plans shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions and intent of this Code. 
4.1.2 Existing-Community Plans shall be prepared in a process of public consultation, and shall be subject to public hearing, review and recommendation of the Planning Commission, and to approval by the Mayor and City Council, in accordance with state law. Once approved, an Existing-Community Plan shall be designated the Official Community Plan for the associated Community Planning Area. The requirements imposed by such a Plan shall be binding within the associated Community Planning Area. 
4.1.3 For any site which lies in a G-4 Sector, or in an area with substantial existing development in the absence of a Sector Plan, and which is greater than 40 contiguous acres under ownership or control of a single landowner or developer, such landowner or developer may initiate the preparation of a New Community Plan subject to the provisions of Article 3, including the minimum acreage requirements specified therein for infill areas. 
4.1.4 For smaller sites within a Community Planning Area subject to an Official Community Plan, developers and landowners shall use only Articles 1, 5, 6 and 7, and Sections 4.11 and 4.12 of this Article as necessary, in accordance with the Transect Zones and other requirements of that Official Community Plan. 
4.1.5 An Existing-Community Plan shall identify, assign, and follow the requirements of the Community Types described in Section 4.3. 
4.1.6 An Existing-Community Plan shall assign Transect Zones and associated density limits according to the provisions of Sections 4.3 and 4.4, and shall assign Civic Functions within each Community Type as described in Sections 4.7, with detailed provisions for site and building development as described in Article 5. 
4.1.7 Existing-Community Plans shall include three maps: the Regulating Plan shall show the City Centers, the Neighborhoods, and the Special Districts within the Community Planning Area with their various Transect Zones and density limits, designating the various Density Transfer Sending and Receiving Areas as provided in Section 4.4, and delineating any overlay districts. The Special Requirements and Options Plan shall, to the extent applicable, assign the Special Requirement designations as provided in Section 4.10, and indicate the various other recommendations and requirements of Sections 4.6, 4.8, and 4.11. The Street and Parking Plan shall include requirements and recommendations predominantly concerning the public realm, as laid forth in Section 4.12. 
4.1.8 Existing-Community Plans may optionally specify additional overlay districts within the Community Planning Area and stipulate additional requirements for those overlay districts. Any such overlays shall comply with the intent of this Code. 
4.1.9 An Existing-Community Plan shall specify the applicability of such Plan to areas within the associated Community Planning Area, in particular determining whether participation within the Community Planning Area shall be mandatory, without recourse to the Existing Local Codes; whether participation shall be optional; or whether participation shall be mandatory within certain districts and optional without. Where participation is optional the Existing-Community Plan shall specify at what scale and by what means areas within the Community Planning Area may opt into the Community Plan. 
4.1.10 The Official Community Plan for each Community Planning Area may be regularly considered for adjustment through public hearing according to the provisions of Section 4.12.6. 
4.2 - TRANSECT ZONES 
4.2.1 Existing-Community Plans shall render the subject Community Planning Area in terms of Neighborhoods (TNDs) and City Centers (RCDs) composed of Transect Zones as described in Tables 1, 2, and 14. Transect Zones shall comprise the elements described in Table 1 and the standards summarized in Table 14 and described in Article 5. All areas shall be planned as parts of Pedestrian Sheds. Existing-Community Plans shall be based on conserving, completing or creating Transect-based urban structure, and shall be reflective of such structure where it exists, prescriptive of such structure where there is none, and corrective of structure inappropriate to the urban fabric. 
4.2.2 Wherever practical, Transect Zones shall be laid out within an Existing Community Plan so that zone boundaries lie along side and rear lot lines or Service Alleys and Lanes, so that Facades of one Transect Zone generally face Facades of the same zone across Thoroughfares. 
4.3 - COMMUNITY TYPES 
    Existing development shall be planned according to the following Community Types, including and assigning, to the extent applicable, the designations of Neighborhood and City Center to existing development patterns. 
4.3.1  Neighborhoods (TNDs Traditional Neighborhood Development) 
Neighborhoods shall be urbanized areas of at least 20 acres that are primarily Residential. A Neighborhood shall be based upon a partial or entire Standard Pedestrian Shed. The physical center of the Neighborhood should be located at an important traffic intersection associated with a Civic or Commercial institution, and the edges of the Neighborhood should blend into an adjacent Neighborhood or City Center without buffer. A Neighborhood shall meet the requirements for a TND as set forth in Tables 2 and 14. 
4.3.2  City Center (RCD or Regional Center Development) 
City Centers (downtowns) shall be urbanized areas of at least 40 acres that are primarily mixed use. A City Center shall be defined by a Long Pedestrian Shed oriented around an important Commercial corridor. City Centers should be the location of large Commercial and Retail uses as well as government and other Civic institutions of regional importance. The edges of a City Center should blend into adjacent Neighborhoods without buffer. A City Center shall meet the requirements for an RCD as set forth in Tables 2 and 14. 
4.3.3  Special Districts (SD) 
Special Districts shall be areas dedicated for certain uses that, by virtue of size or Function, cannot meet the requirements for any Transect Zone or combination of Zones. The use of Special Districts within an Existing-Community Plan shall be subject to review and recommendation of the Planning Commission in the process of preparing an Existing-Community Plan. 
4.4 - DENSITY REQUIREMENTS 
4.4.1 The Community Plan shall establish a Maximum Building-Scale Density and an Absolute Maximum Building-Scale Density for each of the Transect Zones T4 through T6 employed within the Community Planning Area from the range of allowed values in Table 14. All areas within the Community Planning Area sharing the same Transect Zone designation shall be limited by the same Maximum and Absolute Maximum Building-Scale Densities. For Transect Zones T1 and T2, no Building-Scale Density limits shall be defined. 
4.4.2 For each lot within a T4 or higher Transect Zone in the Community Planning Area, the Maximum Building-Scale Density multiplied by the area of the lot yields the Density Allowance for that lot. For Transect Zone T3 the Density Allowance for lots is always one (1) unit per lot. With the exception of cases described in provisions 4.4.3, 4.4.5, and 4.4.6 below, structures built on a lot shall be limited to a number of Equivalent Housing Units which is less than or equal to the By-Right Density Allowance. Equivalent Housing Units represent a combination of mixed use space, lodging bedrooms, and Independent Residential Units according to the following conversation schedule: 
a.  One Independent Residential Unit constitutes one Equivalent Housing Unit. 
b.  One thousand square feet of office or retail space constitutes one Equivalent Housing Unit. 
c.  Two lodging bedrooms constitute one Equivalent Housing Unit. 
4.4.3  Density Transfer Receiving Areas; Density Bonus Receiving Areas. The Existing-Community Plan may designate Building-Scale Areas. The By-Right Density Allowance may be exceeded for a lot within a designated Density Transfer Receiving Area or Bonus Receiving Area on the Existing-Community Plan by an amount equal to the Acquired Density Allowance for the lot, so long as the sum of By-Right and Acquired Density Allowances does not exceed the Absolute Maximum Density Allowance for that lot. 
a.  Density Transfer Receiving Areas are chosen for their ability to support localized additional density, without a net increase of the City's overall density and with lesser ill effects on public welfare and goals of the Comprehensive Plan than if that density increment had not been transferred. 
b.  Density Bonus Receiving Areas are chosen to minimize the impact of slight increases of density to achieve improved urban structure and other goals benefiting community welfare as set forth in the Comprehensive Plan, and to offset any ill effects of an increase in density with advantages accruing from the density placement or the action which led to the granting of the bonus. 
c.  Density Bonuses and Transfers notwithstanding, in no case may the number of Equivalent Housing Units incorporated into a lot exceed the Absolute Maximum Density Allowance for such lot. 
d.  For lots in T3 Zones, the Absolute Maximum Density Allowance is one (1) Equivalent Housing Unit per lot. 
e.  Acquired Density may originate from any Density Sending Area in the City of Gulfport which is designated by any Density Transfer program described in this Code, so long as the restrictions of both the designating program and the limits of the Transect Zone of the Density Recipient property are observed. 
4.4.4  Density Transfer Sending Areas. Existing-Community Plans shall designate Sending Areas for Civic Space Density Transfer, Conservation Density Transfer, and Transit Grid Reserve Density Transfer programs. 
a.  Civic Space Density Transfer Sending Areas are sites of particular value or interest to the Community for their prospective use as Civic Space. Such sites shall be chosen to help achieve the goal of a minimum of 5% Civic Space within a Community Planning Area with an eye to preserving places of unique or unusual beauty which would be damaged or destroyed by development and to correcting planning errors or omissions of the past. Accessibility, availability of other Civic Space within the Community district, proximity to high-density areas, and value as buffer between non-sequential abutting Transect Zones may also be considered in designating Civic Space Density Transfer Sending Areas. After extraction of Density Rights, Civic Space Density Transfer Sending Areas within a Community Planning Area shall be re-zoned as Transect Zone T2. Any area, lot, or parcel designated as a Density Transfer Receiving Area in an Official Community Plan may receive Density Rights acquired from Civic Space Density Transfer Sending Areas. The Existing-Community Plan may include explanation for the designation of a parcel as CSDT Sending Area and may place conditions on the Sending Area Designation which are consistent with the reason for designation. In addition, under the CSDT Program, multiple parcels within a single pedestrian shed may be designated as a Linked Sending Group. In such a case once one parcel has had its Density Rights extracted for use as a Civic Space, the remaining Linked Sending Group parcels are no longer eligible to become Density Donors, and their designation as CSDT Sending Areas expires. 
b.  Conservation Density Transfer Sending Areas are sites worthy of conservation due to scenic beauty, unsuitability for building, critical habitat, riparian buffer alongside streams, open space needed as a result of planning errors or omissions of the past, or inclusion in the categories of Sections 2.3.2 or 2.4.2. After extraction of Density Rights, Conservation Density Transfer Sending Areas within a Community Planning Area shall be re-zoned as Transect Zone T1. Any area, lot, or parcel designated as a Density Receiving Area in an Official Community Plan may receive Density Rights acquired from Conservation Density Transfer Sending Areas. The Existing-Community Plan may include explanation for the designation of a parcel as Conservation Sending Area and may place conditions on the Sending Area Designation which are consistent with the reason for designation. The Conservation Density Transfer program also includes as Sending Areas all O-2 Sector lands other than those explicitly designated as Sending Areas for the Transit Grid Reserve Density Transfer program, if a Sector Plan has been adopted. 
c.  Transit Grid Reserve Density Transfer (TGRDT) Sending Areas are anticipated future transportation corridors. After extraction of Density Rights, TGRDT Sending Areas within a Community Planning Area shall be re-zoned as Transect Zone T1. Any area, lot, or parcel designated as a Density Transfer Receiving Area in an Official Community Plan may receive Density Rights acquired from TGRDT Sending Areas. Thoroughfares eventually constructed on former TGRDT Sending Areas shall be consistent with this Code. 
d.  Designation as a Density Transfer Sending Area provides a lot's owners additional options for land use which support broader Community goals but which are entirely voluntary. In the creation of an Existing-Community Plan, all such Sending Areas shall be assigned to Transect Zones for development according to the methods of Transect-based urban structure to provide seamless urban fabric in the event Density Transfer options go unused. 
4.4.5  Density Recovery Transfers. Density Recovery Transfers are transfers of Density Allowance intended to compensate a property owner for the public dedication of a portion of a parcel or lot which has been recommended for public use in the Existing-Community Plan. As the area of the land to be dedicated is lost to the property owner, a Density Allowance equal to the Maximum Building-Scale Density for the lot multiplied by the area of the portion of land to be dedicated is permanently attached to the remaining lot so that the total Density Allowance of the lot before and after the dedication is unchanged. The following recommendations on the Special Requirements and Options Map of the Existing-Community Plan entitle a lot to a Density Recovery Transfer should the dedication be executed: 
a.  Through Street Recommended 
b.  Service Lane Recommended 
c.  Any recommendation accompanied by the designation Density Recovery Transfer Applies. 
4.4.6  Density Bonuses. Density Bonuses may be generally available throughout a Community Planning Area, may be limited to the designated Density Bonus Receiving Areas on an Existing-Community Plan, or may be restricted to lots specially designated on an Existing-Community Plan, according to the details of the particular Density Bonus Program. In no case may the Absolute Maximum Density Allowance for a lot be exceeded by a receiving lot. Once awarded, a Density Bonus is valid for up to 10 years from the date of award; if not used within that period the Bonus becomes null and void. 
a.  Transit Site Density Bonus. This Density Bonus may be attached to any lot within any Density Bonus Receiving Area within the City and requires the dedication to the City of a site within an area designated on the Street and Parking Plan for a Public-Parking Facility or for a future Transit station. The dedication may reflect that the site must be used to provide Public-Parking Facilities or Transit station. The amount of the Bonus is the By-Right Density Allowance of the site, and the recipient lot of the Bonus may be designated by the owner of the property to be dedicated. 
b.  Street Dedication Bonus. This Density Bonus shall only be available to lots marked on the Special Requirements and Options Plan with the designations Through Street Recommended or Service Lane Recommended. In order to be eligible for the bonus the lot owner must construct and dedicate the recommended Thoroughfare, Service Lane or Service Alley to the City, and the designed and completed Public Frontages of resulting Streets must comply with the requirements of this Code. The amount of the Bonus is one (1) Equivalent Housing Unit for each of the two new lots resulting from a Thoroughfare dedication, or one (1) Equivalent Housing Unit for one of the two new lots, as designated by the lot owner, resulting from a Service Lane or Service Alley dedication. The Street Dedication Bonus shall not exceed four (4) units per increment of two hundred feet of dedicated Street, nor one (1) unit per increment of one hundred feet of Service Lane or Alley length. A Street Dedication Bonus accruing for a Thoroughfare, Service Lane or Alley dedication in a T3 Zone may be applied to any lot in a Density Bonus Receiving Area in the City designated by the owner of the original lot or parcel. The CRC may award a partial Street Dedication Bonus for dedication of right-of-way and/or completed construction of the Public Frontage by Warrant. 
c.  Affordable Housing Density Bonus. The Affordable Housing Density Bonus program is a building-scale bonus available generally to any lot within a designated Density Bonus Receiving Area. It is described in Article 5. 
d.  Affordable Housing Height Bonus. The Affordable Housing Height Bonus program is a building-scale bonus available generally to any lot within a designated Density Bonus Receiving Area. It is described in Article 5. 
4.4.7  Additional Height Allowances and Acquired Density Allowance. The acquisition of Density Allowance units by Density Transfers and Bonuses may entitle a lot to an Additional Height Allowance in excess of the Maximum Height otherwise allowed within the assigned Transect Zone, according to the details of the Density Bonus or Transfer Program. The Existing-Community Plan shall include a formula or table to determine the Additional Height Allowance associated with a particular total Acquired Density Allowance for each Transect Zone. Additional Height Allowances may further be limited to designated City Centers, Density Receiving Areas, or other designated areas. The relationship between Additional Height Allowances and Acquired Density Allowance specified in the Existing-Community Plan shall be guided by the following provisions: 
a.  The number of additional Acquired Density Allowance units required for eligibility for an additional story of Height Allowance shall be proportional to the area of the site. 
b.  The number of additional Acquired Density Allowance units per site acre required for eligibility for an additional story of Height Allowance shall be no less than the quotient of the Maximum Building-Scale Density for the Transect Zone and the Maximum Height for the Transect Zone in which the site is located. 
c.  The number of additional Acquired Density Allowance units required for an additional story of Height Allowance after the second should generally increase with total Height Allowance in order to reflect the added toll on surrounding areas exacted by a structure of greater height, however. 
d.  The minimum number of Acquired Density Allowance units required to qualify for the first additional story of Height Allowance may be greater than the additional number of Acquired Density Allowance units required to qualify for the second additional story and for subsequent additional stories of Height Allowance. 
4.5 - [RESERVED] 
4.6 - STREETSCAPE REQUIREMENTS 
4.6.1  General 
Within Zones T4 through T6 pedestrian comfort and safety shall be a primary consideration of all Thoroughfare design, rehabilitation and renovation projects, and an important objective of Existing-Community Plans. The following methods shall be used to achieve this objective: 
a.  Streetscape related designations, recommendations, and requirements shall be indicated on the Street and Parking Plan of the Existing-Community Plan. Designations, recommendations, and requirements that directly affect lot and property owners shall also be indicated on the Special Requirements and Options Map of the Existing-Community Plan. 
b.  In and near Neighborhood centers and City Centers, and in general throughout T4, T5, and T6 Zones, Existing-Community Plans shall recommend retrofit of street Traffic Calming designs as necessary to accommodate pedestrian use and to slow traffic to pedestrian-safe speeds by the designation Traffic Calming Recommended on the Street and Parking Plan. Problematic areas may be designated Traffic Calming Redesign Required in the Street and Parking Plan to recommend future street design requirements. 
c.  Existing-Community Plans may require placement of signage warning drivers of pedestrian primacy along specified routes by the designation Pedestrian Primacy Warnings. 
d.  Existing-Community Plans may require curb parking and street tree plantings as Traffic Calming mechanisms. 
e.  An Existing-Community Plan shall indicate suggested sites for the potential locations of Transit Stations within or near City Centers. The plan may also indicate such suggested sites near extensive T5 Zones away from City Centers. Such designated sites shall qualify for a Transit Site Density Bonus. 
4.6.2  Thoroughfares 
a.  Creation, completion, and restoration of a regular, connected grid of streets to provide dispersed traffic capacity and multiple alternative routes through a Community Planning Area shall be a guiding objective in the preparation of Existing-Community Plans. 
b.  Connection and extension of existing Thoroughfares through blocks may be recommended through the designation Through Street Recommended, and may be incentivized through implicit Density Recovery Transfer, through explicit Street Dedication Bonuses, and through Conditional Transect Zone Adjustments as designated on the Special Requirements and Options Map of the Existing-Community Plan, in accordance with Section 4.11. The Existing-Community Plan in such cases shall indicate the recommended street connections and an approximate route across the block. 
c.  Addition of Service Alleys or Service Lanes to a block, or extension of an existing Rear Alley or Lane through a block, may be recommended through the designation Service Lane Recommended, and may be incentivized through the included Density Recovery Transfer, and through explicit Street Dedication Bonuses as designated on the Special Requirements and Options Map of the Existing-Community Plan. Recommended routes of the Service Lanes and Service Alleys through the block shall be indicated in such cases. 
d.  Rights-of-way for future recommended transit corridors shall be designated as Transit Grid Reserve Density Transfer Sending Areas on the Community Plan and shall entitle parcels through which the corridors are routed to recover otherwise-lost Density Rights in exchange for dedication of the rights of way. The Existing-Community Plan may also designate portions of such parcels resulting from a potential corridor dedication to Conditional Transect Zone Adjustments or to Street Dedication Bonuses. Transit Grid Reserve Density Transfers shall be used within Existing Communities for grid enhancement for particularly critical routes and for redundancy of critical routes, and Thoroughfares constructed on them shall be consistent with this Code. 
e.  Existing-Community Plans shall designate streets in T5 and T6 zones for Curb Parking wherever possible, and may recommend future redesign to accommodate curb parking where existing street conditions do not allow. Plans shall designate curb parking areas wherever possible in areas within T3 and T4 Zones served by Rear Alleys and Rear Lanes. Curb parking may be allowed wherever existing street widths consistent with Table 3 allow. 
f.  Curbside locations for Taxi Stands may be designated within City Centers. 
g.  Routes suitable for a bicycle network should be designated throughout as defined in Article 7 Definitions of Terms and allocated in Table 14E. The community bicycle network should be connected to existing or proposed Sector networks wherever possible. 
4.6.3  Public Frontages 
a.  Existing-Community Plans shall specify street tree plantings in accordance with the requirements of Article 5 and with Table 6 on the Street and Parking Plan. In order to facilitate the quickest possible restoration of the peculiar benefits of shade-bearing street trees, alternating quick-growth species with more desirable but slower-growing species shall be allowed in all Zones; an Existing-Community Plan employing such alternate plantings should also stipulate a schedule for replacing quick-growth species with more desirable and long-lived species after the original planting has sufficiently matured to provide shade cover, in accordance with the requirements of Article 5. Landscaping requirements may be specified for designated areas if in accordance with Table 4B. 
b.  Shade being critical to attracting pedestrian traffic in the local climate, the Frontage along at least principal Thoroughfares of intensive mixed-use areas, including Neighborhood centers and City Centers, may be designated in the Existing-Community Plan for coordinated pedestrian shade cover by means of the Special Requirement designation Shaded Pedestrian Way. Regular spacing of street trees in T4+, T5, and T6 Zones in City Centers shall not exceed 30 feet, with layout adjusted to accommodate necessary physical interruptions. 
c.  Streetlights consistent with the requirements of Table 5 shall be selected for each Transect Zone and specified for consistent use throughout the Community Planning Area on the Streets and Parking Plan of the Existing-Community Plan. 
4.6.4 [RESERVED] 
4.7 - CIVIC FUNCTIONS 
4.7.1  General 
a.  An Existing-Community Plan shall designate Civic Space (CS) and Civic Buildings (CB) on all three maps of the Plan, and may additionally allow their creation by Warrant or by Planning Commission Approval according to the requirements of Table 10. 
b.  Civic Functions may only be Warranted so long as they do not occupy more than a total of 20% of the area of each Pedestrian Shed. A Civic Function requiring more than 20% of the Pedestrian Shed shall require the creation of a Special District with its own standards (see Section 2.9.2) by planning process in accordance with state law. 
c.  Parking for Civic Functions shall be determined by Warrant. 
4.7.2  Civic Space (CS) 
a.  Within Infill Communities, Civic Spaces may be approved by Warrant in any Transect Zone. 
b.  Civic Spaces shall be generally designed as described in Table 13. 
4.7.3  Civic Building (CB) 
a.  Civic Buildings shall be approved by Planning Commission or by Warrant according to the requirements of Table 10 in any Transect Zone on sites reserved for Civic Buildings. 
b.  Civic Buildings shall not be subject to the Requirements of Article 5. The particulars of their design shall be determined by Planning Commission in consultation with the City Architect and the Urban Design Center, if one has been established. 
4.8 - PARKING ACCOMMODATION REQUIREMENTS 
4.8.1 Except where explicitly noted within this Section, parking accommodation requirements shall appear on the Street and Parking Map of an Existing-Community Plan. 
4.8.2 An Existing-Community Plan shall indicate suggested sites for the locations of Public-Parking Facilities near City Centers, with sufficient sites so indicated that any T5 or T6 Zone which is part of a City Center lies within one-quarter mile of at least one such site. The plan may also indicate such suggested sites near extensive T5 Zones away from City Centers. Such designated sites shall qualify for a Transit Site Density Bonus. 
4.8.3 The Existing-Community Plan shall designate streets within T5 and T6 Zones for Metered Curb Parking wherever possible. 
4.8.4 The Existing-Community Plan shall delineate Parking Benefit Districts throughout T3 and T4L Zones near Neighborhood centers or at least those within one-quarter mile of T5 and T6 Zones which are part of City Centers. 
4.8.5 All streets in T4+ Zones where curb parking is available shall be designated as either Metered Curb Parking areas or as part of an adjacent Parking Benefit District. Other intensive mixed-use areas should also be considered for Metered Curb Parking designation and a surrounding Parking Benefit District. 
4.8.6 Parking spaces shall be Unbundled from interior floor space in all T4+, T5, and T6 Zones within areas designated as City Centers on the Existing-Community Plan. The Plan may also delineate and designate other areas as Unbundled Parking Areas. In areas so designated parking spaces shall be sold or leased independently of interior floor space. All intensive mixed-use areas should be designated as Unbundled Parking Areas. 
4.8.7 At least one-half (1/2) of the parking requirement for planned uses in T5 and T6 Zones within City Centers or within Unbundled Parking Areas shall be provided off-site in Public-Parking Facilities within one-quarter mile (1/4 mi) of the use which generates the requirement. The distance limit may be increased to one-half mile (1/2 mi) by Warrant. 
4.8.8 In T4+, T5, or T6 Zones within an Unbundled Parking Area or within a City Center, on-site parking spaces shall be provided as part of a Public-Parking Facility. 
4.8.9 In Neighborhood Centers and in T4+ and T5 Zones outside Unbundled Parking Areas and City Centers, the Existing-Community Plan shall require that surface parking lots which are located in adjacent lots without intervening buildings must provide direct vehicular access between lots. 
4.8.10 Certified Affordable Housing units shall be subject to reduced parking requirements of one (1) parking space per dwelling unit. Within Unbundled Parking Areas, including T5 and T6 Zones in City Centers, the parking requirement for Certified Affordable Housing may be altogether waived, subject to approval by Warrant. 
4.9 - ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS 
4.9.1 Existing-Community Plans may incorporate and recommend or require compliance with Community Architectural Guidelines, adopted as supplemental to the Community Plan and stipulating additional architectural standards specific to the Community, beyond those required by this Code. 
4.9.2 A Community may choose to create Community Architectural Guidelines after approval of an Existing-Community Plan, and to incorporate such Guidelines into the Official Community Plan by amendment as stipulated in Section 4.12. 
4.9.3 A Community Plan may impose a requirement, within designated overlay districts, or generally across the entire Community Planning Area, for architectural review of proposed buildings or structures, or of their exterior improvement, alteration, or addition, for determination by the City Architect of compliance with such Community Architectural Guidelines, in accordance with the City's Architectural Review Ordinance, if such exists. 
4.9.4 A Community Plan may require specified Stepbacks in Facades above specified heights along Frontage lines. 
4.9.5 A Community Plan may require Buildout-at-Height Limits limiting the blockage by buildings of light and breeze passage parallel to one or more lot lines or Frontage lines at several specified heights. 
4.10 - SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS 
4.10.1 To the extent applicable an Existing-Community Plan may include the following special requirements on the Special Requirements and Options Map: 
a.  A differentiation of the Thoroughfares into a Primary Grid (P-Grid) and a Secondary Grid (S-Grid). Buildings along the P-Grid shall be held to the highest standard of this Code in support of pedestrian activity. Buildings along the S-Grid may be more readily considered for Warrants and Variances allowing automobile-oriented standards. The Frontages assigned to the S-Grid shall not exceed 30% of the total length within a Pedestrian Shed. 
b.  A designation for Mandatory or Recommended Retail Frontage requiring that a building provide a shopfront at sidewalk level along the entire length of the Frontage. The shopfront shall be no less than 70% glazed in clear glass and provided with an awning, gallery, or arcade overlapping the sidewalk as generally illustrated in Table 7. The first floor shall be confined to Retail use through the depth of the First Layer. For cases where the Minimum Building Elevation is more than 5 feet above grade, this requirement may be satisfied through the creation of an elevated sidewalk, the substitution of a Sidewalk Retail area in accordance with 4.10.1d, or some combination of these requirements subject to approval by Warrant. 
A designation for Recommended Retail Frontage shall qualify the designated property for a Density Bonus of 1 EHU per 50 feet of frontage built out in compliance with a Retail Frontage requirement. 
Once the Density Bonus is issued, the Recommended Retail Frontage requirement shall become binding on the property. A designation for Mandatory Convertible Retail Frontage shall require that a building be constructed so that the frontage may be converted through minor reconstruction without structural modification to be compliant with the Mandatory Retail Frontage requirement. Conversion to full compliance with a Mandatory Retail Frontage designation may be required as a condition of approval for any future interior or exterior building permit by the CRC. 
c.  A designation for Mandatory or Recommended Gallery/Arcade Frontage, requiring that a building provide a permanent cover over the sidewalk, either cantilevered or supported by columns. The Gallery or Arcade Frontage may be combined with a Retail Frontage as shown in Table 7. 
d.  Designation of an outside area for Sidewalk Retail, allowing use in the specified area by pushcart peddlers, outdoor restaurants, and other open market uses without additional Planning Commission approval, and requiring provision on abutting lots for future leasable open-market services including associated restaurant space with dedicated access to the sidewalk, secure storage space within parking structures for pushcarts, and coordinated design of Public and Private Frontages within the area to accommodate Sidewalk Retail usages. 
e.  A designation of Coordinated Streetscape Frontage, requiring that the Public and Private Frontages be coordinated as a single, coherent landscape and paving design. 
f.  Specific Facade alignment requirements for streets where the Facade alignments are traditionally not parallel to the street, or where Frontage Lines and side lot lines are not orthogonal. 
g.  A designation of Shaded Pedestrian Way, requiring that Public and Private Frontages are coherently planned and planted with a combination of fast-growing and of more long-lived shade trees, so arranged in combination with awnings, galleries, and arbors as to provide nearly continuous shade cover for pedestrians along Frontages, sidewalks and pedestrian paths so designated. 
h.  A designation for Cross Block Passages, requiring a minimum 8-foot-wide ground-level pedestrian access be reserved between certain buildings with the goal of limiting pedestrian-route block face lengths to less than 400 feet. 
i.  A designation of Terminated Vista for a site, requiring that any building located at that site be provided with architectural articulation of a Type and character that responds to the location as approved by the CRC. 
j.  Without limiting any provision hereof relating to the Historic District or a Historic Structure or Historic Site, a designation of Buildings of Value, requiring that such buildings and structures may be altered or demolished only when in accordance with preservation standards and protocols adopted by the Planning Commission. 
k.  A designation of Infill Plan Required for blocks which deviate significantly from the block or lot size requirements for the Transect Zone(s) assigned in the Community Plan, as specified in Section 4.11. 
(Ord. No. 2558, § 1, 10-17-07) 
4.11 - NON-CONFORMING CONDITIONS 
4.11.1  Damage Due to Emergency Conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained or implied herein, if a building, structure, or other improvement is damaged or destroyed by any event resulting in the declaration of an emergency or disaster applicable to the City by the Mayor and City Council, the owner of record on the date of the event may repair or rebuild such building, structure or other improvement on the same building site and with the same building footprint by right. To qualify, the building, structure, or other improvement must have lawfully existed prior to the causative event and neither the lot, use, building, improvement, structure nor condition may be added to or altered in any way, except to remedy the effects of such damage or destruction, unless such additions or alterations cause the lot, use, building, improvement, structure or condition to conform more closely with the provisions of this Code; and repair or replacement of such buildings, structures, or improvements shall be completed within one (1) year of the causative event. 
4.11.2  Pre-Existing Non-Conformity. Without limiting the foregoing, any lot, parcel, use, building, improvement, structure or condition subject to an Official Community Plan under this Code that lawfully existed upon the adoption by the Mayor and City Council of that Community Plan may continue to exist as it did, and may be repaired to such pre-existing condition. The lot, use, building, improvement, structure or condition may not be changed or added to after such date, except to conform more closely with the provisions of this Code. If the use or condition ceases for a period in excess of one (1) year, subsequent use or condition shall be fully compliant with this Code. 
4.11.3  Oversized Parcels. An Existing-Community Plan may recommend that large parcels and lots included in Transect Zones whose maximum lot dimensions such parcels significantly exceed should be subdivided in order to be made compliant with this Code by the designation Subdivision Recommended or Subdivision Required, according to the severity of the dimensional mismatch. The Existing-Community Plan should assign such a parcel to a single Transect Zone. If such a parcel would more appropriately be subdivided and assigned to more than one Transect Zone, the Existing-Community Plan may designate the parcel as Infill Plan Recommended or Required, and may include on the Special Requirements and Options Map a Conditional Transect Zone Adjustment (CTZA) recommendation which maps the parcel into multiple Transect Zones. The CTZA may be adopted through an abbreviated process. 
4.11.4  Oversized Blocks. Existing-Community Plans should address blocks which exceed the maximum block perimeter length of the assigned Transect Zone(s) according to whether such blocks are largely developed or undeveloped and according to the compatibility of any existing development with the Community Plan. 
a.  Undeveloped parcels which are too large to meet requirements of the assigned Transect Zone and which are located on such oversized blocks, but which are too small to meet the requirement for submitting a New Community Plan in infill areas, should be designated Infill Plan Required on the Special Requirements and Options Map, and may include a recommended block layout plan and Conditional Transect Zone Adjustment recommendations appropriate to the proposed layout on the Special Requirements and Options Map. 
b.  Parcels too large to meet requirements of the assigned Transect Zone, located on such oversized blocks, and developed with uses or structures which are incompatible with the surrounding Community may continue according to Section 4.11.2; but the Existing-Community Plan should designate such parcels Infill Plan Required on the Special Requirements and Options Map, and may include a recommended block layout plan and Conditional Transect Zone Adjustment recommendations appropriate to the proposed layout on the Special Requirements and Options Map. 
c.  Oversized blocks comprising primarily lots and parcels developed compatibly with the surrounding Community should be addressed in the Existing-Community Plan through use of Through Street and Service Lane Recommendations incorporating Street Dedication Bonuses with Density Recovery Transfers on the Special Requirements and Options Map (in accordance with Section 4.6.2), and may additionally include Conditional Transect Zone Adjustments on the Special Requirements and Options Map. 
4.11.5  Infill Plans. Infill Plans shall be submitted and approved prior to development of parcels designated on the Community Plan as 'Infill Plan Required.' Additionally any parcel owner may submit an Infill Plan for redevelopment of a parcel or a contiguous cluster of parcels subject to a Community Plan. Submission requirements and approval process for Infill Plans shall be in accordance with Section 4.12. 
a.  Infill Plans are submitted and approved through a process similar to that for New Community Plans, but to the extent that the areas they describe are already governed by the requirements of an existing Official Community Plan, the application requirements are reduced. 
b.  For plans which adhere closely to any recommended street routes and Conditional Transect Zone Adjustments included in an Official Community Plan, as determined by the CRC, Infill Plans may be approved by an abbreviated process including a single public hearing for approval of block, street, and lot layout and Transect re-zoning. Infill Plans differing substantively from the recommendations of the Existing-Community Plan shall require separate public hearings for the Transect re-zoning and for approval of the street, block, and lot layouts subject to the ultimate Transect Zones. 
c.  Approval of any Infill Plan shall be determined based on the consistency of the plan with the Community Plan and with the surrounding area. An Infill Plan shall design a parcel as part of the surrounding existing Pedestrian Shed, blending Transect Zones at edges seamlessly. An Infill Plan may not create a new Neighborhood center if an existing Neighborhood center lies within 1/4 mile of the parcel unless the Infill Plan creates by connection of Thoroughfares an intersection of sufficient importance to merit such a new center. 
d.  An Infill Plan shall demonstrate consistency with the requirements and character of the governing Community Plan. 
e.  Density Recovery Transfers shall be available where designated in the Community Plan for Infill plans which include recommended through-street connections or preserve recommended Transit Grid Reserves. 
4.11.6  Conditional Transect Zone Adjustments. Except for rare cases the Existing-Community Plan should map a single lot or parcel to a single Transect Zone. In cases the Pedestrian Shed layout would be better served by mapping a subdivided oversized parcel into multiple Transect Zones, the Existing-Community Plan may include a recommended plan for the oversized parcel on the Special Requirements and Options Map showing recommended through street and alley routings and a recommended allocation amongst several Transect Zones. Designating the recommended zone assignment for the parcel as a Conditional Transect Zone Adjustment allows the parcel owner to utilize a simplified application and approval process if the proposed Infill Plan adheres closely to the recommendations. 
4.11.7 Submission and implementation of plans for new Thoroughfares and blocks as part of an Infill Plan implementation or in response to Through Street or Service Lane Recommendations according to Section 4.11 shall be subject to the Special Tree Requirements of Article 3, Section 3.9. 
4.12 - PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 
4.12.1 Approval Process for Existing-Community Plans

c.  A Street and Parking Plan, comprising a map showing Unbundled Parking Areas including T5 and T6 Zones within City Centers; Parking Benefit Districts; recommended Public-Parking Facility sites; recommended Transit Station sites; Through Street and Service Lane Recommendations, including approximate routes; Transit Grid Reserve Recommendations; Traffic Calming recommendations and requirements; Pedestrian Primacy Warning Signage recommendations; street tree planting requirements; curb parking additions; Metered Curb Parking designations; and Taxi Stand designations. 
d.  Other supporting documents and articles, potentially including explanatory notes; an article invoking architectural review; an adoption article; an applicability article; an article defining any overlay districts; Community Architectural Guidelines; Absolute Maximum Building-Scale Densities and Absolute Height Limits for Transect Zones within the Community Planning Area; a formula or table relating Additional Height Allowances to Acquired Density Allowances; specific streetlight requirements; and any other supporting recommendations or requirements permitted under this Code. 
4.12.3 Approval Process for Infill Plans 
a.  Infill Plans which represent only re-subdivision of parcels or lots with no street additions or changes to Transect Zone assignment from those imposed by the Community Plan, or subdivision plans filed in response to Subdivision Recommended or Subdivision Required recommendations, may be approved administratively by the CRC subject to the following requirements: the resulting lot widths and block-perimeter lengths shall lie within the limits permitted in the assigned Transect Zones; the Infill Plan shall include Rear Alleys or Rear Lanes for all lots, or provision for future dedication of such Service Lanes where adjacent properties make such Service Lanes presently impossible; and no changes in the Transect Zones assigned by the Official Community Plan are required. 
b.  Infill Plans shall be evaluated by the CRC if a Conditional Transect Zone Adjustment with recommended plan was indicated on the original Community Plan. If the CRC determines that the Infill Plan adheres closely to the CTZA recommendation, the plan may proceed, subject to final public hearing before the Planning Commission after the required public notice is given. Otherwise the owner may appeal to the Planning Commission, or apply for a Variance or Variances. 
c.  In the absence of a CTZA, or on appeal from the CRC, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing after the required public notice to determine whether a proposed Infill Plan satisfies the intent of the Official Community Plan and to determine approval of the proposed maps as with a SmartCode Planning Approval for a New Community. An Infill Plan found to meet the intent of the governing Official Community Plan may be scheduled for a second public hearing for approval of the final plat and the final Transect Zone assignments as for a New Community. Otherwise the plan initiators may appeal or apply for a Variance or Variances. 
d.  If ruled consistent by the CRC or Planning Commission, the Infill Plan proceeds to public hearing for approval by Mayor and City Council with advisory comments by Planning Commission or CRC. 
e.  The Planning Official shall make such additional procedural requirements as necessary to facilitate the evaluation and approval process. 
4.12.4 Submission Requirements for Infill Plans 
a.  Plat submission requirements for Infill Plans are substantially similar to those for New Community Plans. Requirements for the CRC review and/or first Planning Commission hearing (if required) corresponds to the SmartCode Planning Approval hearing for a New Community Plan as described in Section 3.12.5 with the exception of 3.12.5e; requirements for the final hearing for an Infill Plan corresponds to the New Community Plan Approval hearing and is subject to the relevant requirements of Section 3.12.6 with the exception of 3.12.6g. 
b.  Infill Plan submissions shall include a Regulating Plan for the infill area comprising a map showing Transect Zone districts, Density Transfer and Density Bonus Receiving Areas, and City Center district boundaries running through the infill area. 
c.  Infill Plan submissions shall include a Special Requirements Plan showing any Special Requirement designations. Recommended Public-Parking Facilities, Through Street and Service Lane recommendations, Infill Plan Required designations, and Conditional Transect Zone Adjustments are not permitted within an Infill Plan. Secondary Grid designations are only permitted for the extension of streets so designated in the Existing-Community Plan. 
d.  Street tree planting requirements and metered curb parking requirements may be included in the Special Requirements Plan for Infill Plan submissions. 
e.  Infill Plans may not change Transect Zone parameters including density or height limits from those set by the Official Community Plan, and may not include any of the optional documents described in Sections 3.12.5e or 3.12.6g. 
4.12.5  Amendment or Rezoning to an Official Community Plan 
A community plan which has been approved under this Code may be amended or rezoned through public notice and hearing consistent with state law. Procedure for amendment or rezoning of an Official Community Plan shall be as specified by the Existing Local Codes, with the exception that the Planning Official shall also provide notice to persons and organizations on the Notification List in accordance with section 1.4.7. The City shall also make reasonable efforts to provide public notice through the mass communications means readily and inexpensively available to it. Official Community Plans may only be amended so as to remain compliant with this Code. Amendments to Official Community Plans, in order to be approved, shall be based on conserving, completing or creating Transect-based Pedestrian Sheds and urban structures. Proposed amendments which damage or weaken or violate the structure of Pedestrian Sheds within the Community Planning Area, or of the Community as a whole, shall be rejected. The public hearing process under Existing Local Codes shall be adhered to for any amendment or rezoning request to an official community plan. 
(Ord. No. 2600, § 3, 8-19-08) 
4.12.6  Succession. Ten years after the approval is granted for a Community Plan, and every ten years thereafter, at the request of residents or property owners within the Community Planning Area, each Transect Zone, except the T1 Natural and the T2 Rural, shall be considered for rezoning in whole or in part to the successional (next higher numbered) Transect Zone through public consultation and at the recommendation of the Planning Commission through public hearing after 15 days advance published notice, and by approval of the Mayor and the City Council. Until such rezoning is complete, zoning for each Transect Zone shall remain unchanged.

a.  Newly platted lots shall be dimensioned according to Section 5.3.11. 
b.  Buildings shall be disposed in relation to the boundaries of their lots according to Section 5.3.11. 
c.  One Principal Building at the Frontage and one Outbuilding to the rear of the Principal Building may be built on each lot as shown in Table 16C. In addition a second Outbuilding is permitted in the Third Layer if one of the Outbuildings is a detached garage, if its Disposition is compliant with requirements of this Article, if such detached garage is accessed via a Service Alley or Lane, and if the Principal Building, detached garage, and other Outbuilding are each separated one from the other by at least 10 feet. 
d.  Lot coverage by building shall not exceed that shown in Section 5.3.11. 
e.  Facades shall be built parallel to a rectilinear Principal Frontage Line, parallel to the tangent of a curved Principal Frontage Line, or perpendicular to side lot lines. Facade alignment shall comply with any requirements indicated in the Community Plan. 
f.  Setbacks for Principal Buildings shall be as shown in Table 14I. In the case of an Infill lot, front Setbacks shall match one or the other of the existing adjacent Setbacks, or shall match an intermediate value between the two, unless the resulting Setbacks would violate the requirements of Table 14I. Setbacks may otherwise be adjusted by Warrant. 
g.  Rear Setbacks for Outbuildings shall be a minimum of 15 feet measured from the centerline of the Alley or Rear Lane easement. In the absence of a Rear Alley or Lane, the rear Setback shall be as shown in Section 5.3.11. 
h.  Building Types shall be as shown in Table 9. 
i.  [RESERVED] 
5.3.2  Building Configuration (T3) 
a.  Private Frontage types shall conform to and be allocated in accordance with Table 7 and Section 5.3.11. 
b.  [RESERVED] 
c.  [RESERVED] 
d.  Building Heights shall conform to Table 8 and be as shown in Section 5.3.11. 
e.  [RESERVED] 
f.  Building Height shall be measured from the Height Baseline appropriate to the site: outside Flood Hazard Areas regulated by the City's Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance, the Height Baseline shall be the average grade at the primary Frontage Line for the lot; inside Flood Hazard Areas regulated by the City's Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance, the Height Baseline shall be the Minimum Buildable Elevation. The vertical offset between the Height Baseline and the finish surface of the first floor above the Height Baseline shall not exceed four (4) feet. 
g.  No Story shall exceed 14 feet in height, measured from floor to ceiling. 
h.  Any Basement-level space required for compliance with Flood Ordinance requirements in excess of 8 feet and not contained within a filled foundation or chain-wall foundation shall be designed for use as (i) parking or storage space set into the structure into the second and deeper Layers, and concealed from view from all streets, (ii) an open market, loggia, porch, or combination thereof, or other open-air area for recreation, relaxation or gathering, (iii) enclosed commercial or retail space to the extent permitted by applicable FEMA requirements and T3 Zone usage limits, or other use permitted by the Planning Office. 
5.3.3  Building Function & Density (T3) 
a.  Buildings in each Transect Zone shall conform to the Functions described in Table 10 or 11 and Section 5.3.11. Functions that do not conform to the requirements of Tables 10 and 11 shall require approval by Warrant or by Variance. 
b.  Function Volume accommodated on a lot shall be limited by the ability of available parking to meet the parking requirement corresponding to the Function Volume. However, under no circumstances may the Function Volume accommodated on the lot exceed the Density Allowance for that lot. 
c.  The parking requirement for any Function associated with a building may be reduced where on-site parking spaces required for two distinct Functions are physically and practicably accessible within the same facility to vehicles associated with the different uses. To compute the reduction in required spaces for each of the two Functions, divide the smaller of the parking requirements for the two Functions by the appropriate Sharing Factor from Table 12, then subtract the result from the smaller of the two parking requirements. This difference is one-half the Effective Parking Bonus, and the original parking requirement for each of the two Functions may be reduced by one-half the Effective Parking Bonus. Effective Parking Bonuses shall only be available for distinct Functions pair-wise. To qualify for any Effective Parking Bonus, all parking spaces included in the calculation for both Functions shall be on the usage site generating the requirements, publicly available, and mutually accessible. 
d.  Within the Long Pedestrian Shed of a TOD, the Effective Parking available for calculating the Function Volume on each lot may be increased by twenty-five percent (25%), or conversely the parking requirement for a particular Function Volume may be reduced by twenty percent (20%). 
e.  [RESERVED] 
f.  [RESERVED] 
g.  A Home Occupation operated by the property owner is permitted by right in any single Story or Outbuilding of a fee-simple lot, subject to the functional limitations stated in Article 7 Definitions and the parking limitations stated in Table 11. Home Occupation requires two (2) parking spaces in addition to the residential parking requirements for the lot in T3 Zones. 
h.  An Outbuilding may be used as an Ancillary Dwelling Unit subordinate to the Principal Building in a T3 zone subject to the following restrictions: 
1.  One (1) additional parking space shall be provided to accommodate the use of the Outbuilding; and 
2.  The primary residence of the property owner shall be either the Principal Unit or the Ancillary Dwelling Unit of the property for more than 6 months of the year; and 
3.

5.8 - SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS 
5.8.1 A Community Plan may designate the following special requirements: 
a.  A differentiation of the Thoroughfares into a Primary Grid (P-Grid) and a Secondary Grid (S-Grid). Buildings along the P-Grid shall be held to the highest standard of this Code in support of pedestrian activity. Buildings along the S-Grid may be more readily considered for Warrants and Variances allowing automobile-oriented standards. The Frontages assigned to the S-Grid shall not exceed 30% of the total length within a Pedestrian Shed. 
b.  A designation for Mandatory or Recommended Retail Frontage requiring that a building provide a shopfront at sidewalk level along the entire length of the Frontage. The shopfront shall be no less than 70% glazed in clear glass and provided with an awning overlapping the sidewalk as generally illustrated in Table 7. The first floor shall be confined to Retail use through the depth of the First Layer. For cases where the first story is located more than 5 feet above grade, this requirement may be satisfied through the creation of an elevated sidewalk, the substitution of a Sidewalk Retail area in accordance with 4.10.1d, or some combination of these requirements subject to approval of a design by the City Architect and Urban Design Center and to Warrant. 
A designation for Recommended Retail Frontage shall qualify the designated property for a Density Bonus of 1 EHU per 50 feet of frontage built out in compliance with a Retail Frontage requirement. 
Once the Density Bonus is issued, the Recommended Retail Frontage requirement shall become binding on the property. A designation for Mandatory Convertible Retail Frontage shall require that a building be constructed so that the frontage may be converted through minor reconstruction without structural modification to be compliant with the Mandatory Retail Frontage requirement. Conversion to full compliance with a Mandatory Retail Frontage designation may be required as a condition of approval for any future interior or exterior building permit by the CRC. 
c.  A designation for Mandatory or Recommended Gallery/Arcade Frontage, requiring that a building provide a permanent cover over the sidewalk, either cantilevered or supported by columns. The Gallery or Arcade Frontage may be combined with a Retail Frontage as shown in Table 7. 
d.  Designation of an outside area for Sidewalk Retail, allowing use in the specified area by pushcart peddlers, outdoor restaurants, and other open market uses without additional Planning Commission approval, and requiring provision on abutting lots for future leasable open-market services including associated restaurant space with dedicated access to the sidewalk, secure storage space within parking structures for pushcarts, and coordinated design of Public and Private Frontages within the area to accommodate Sidewalk Retail usages. 
e.  A designation of Coordinated Streetscape Frontage, requiring that the Public and Private Frontages be coordinated as a single, coherent landscape and paving design. 
f.  Specific Facade alignment requirements for streets where the Facade alignments are traditionally not parallel to the street, or where Frontage Lines and side lot lines are not orthogonal. 
g.  A designation of Shaded Pedestrian Way, requiring that Public and Private Frontages are coherently planned and planted with a combination of fast-growing and of more long-lived shade trees, so arranged in combination with awnings, galleries, and arbors as to provide nearly continuous shade cover for pedestrians along Frontages, sidewalks and pedestrian paths so designated. 
h.  A designation for Cross Block Passages, requiring a minimum 8-foot-wide ground-level pedestrian access be reserved between certain buildings. 
i.  A designation of Terminated Vista for a site, requiring that any building located at that site be provided with architectural articulation of a Type and character that responds to the location as approved by the CRC. 
j.  Without limiting any provision hereof relating to the Historic District or a Historic Structure or Historic Site, a designation of Buildings of Value, requiring that such buildings and structures may be altered or demolished only when in accordance with preservation standards and protocols adopted by the Planning Commission. 
k.  A designation of Infill Plan Required for blocks which deviate significantly from the block or lot size requirements for the Transect Zone(s) assigned in the Community Plan, as specified in Section 4.11. This designation may be accompanied by a Conditional Transect Zone Adjustment (CTZA) recommendation including rough block layout and associated new Transect zoning. An Infill Plan which adheres to a provided CTZA recommendation may be approved by a more expedited process than one which does not. 
(Ord. No. 2558, § 1, 10-17-07) 
5.9 - BUILDING-SCALE DENSITY LIMITS, TRANSFERS, AND BONUSES 
    Building-Scale Density Limits, Transfers, and Bonuses being useful tools for correcting planning mistakes of the past, of bringing non-conforming parcels into conformance with the Community Plan, and for clustering density to encourage community and protect sensitive resources, all without compulsion, such density options may be made available to designated lots in order to equitably accomplish goals of the City's Comprehensive Plan. Transfers and Bonuses, where available, shall provide localized opportunities to exceed typical density and, in some cases determined by the Community Plan, height limits in exchange for either absorbing density from a less appropriate site or for providing a certain significant improvements to the public welfare. 
5.9.1  Building Scale Density Limits 
a.  The Maximum Building-Scale Density associated with each Transect Zone, as specified in the Community Plan, shall determine, by multiplication with the lot area, the number of Equivalent Housing Units of density (the "Density Allowance") available for use on any lot within any such Transect Zone district in that Community Plan, subject to provision 5.9.1b. 
b.  The By-Right Density Allowance for a lot determined by the Maximum Building-Scale Density may not be exceeded, except by the amount it is augmented by one of the methods described in 5.9.2 or 5.9.3 (by the "Acquired Density Allowance"). In no case shall the Total Density Allowance developed on any particular lot exceed the largest whole number below the product of the Absolute Maximum Building-Scale Density and the lot area (the "Absolute Maximum Density Allowance"). 
5.9.2  Building-Scale Density Transfers 
Building-Scale Density Transfers attach additional Density Rights to the recipient lot perpetually and shall be recorded as deed restrictions. Such transfers shall be handled in accordance with the procedures established in Article 1. 
a.  Density Recovery Transfer (DRT). In cases where an Official Community Plan for an infill area recommends that a portion of a lot or parcel be utilized for a public purpose, including a Thoroughfare to connect existing streets, a Rear Alley or Service Lane, a Pedestrian Promenade, or a Civic Space, a lot may be designated as eligible for a Density Recovery Transfer. Such a lot shall receive a Density Recovery Transfer of a number of Equivalent Density Units calculated to provide the same Density Allowance after the transfer of land to the public use as before. To qualify for the DRT, that portion of the lot must be dedicated to public use in accordance with the original Community Plan recommendation. 
b.  Civic Space Density Transfer (CSDT). Areas designated on the Community Plan as Civic Space Transfer Sending Area may be acquired, rendered for public use as Civic Space, and vacated of Density Rights by granting of a perpetual conservation easement with unlimited public access to an approved non-profit organization. The owner may then designate a recipient property or properties for the By-Right Density Allowance of the lot designated for CSDT. Any such recipient property must be designated as part of a Density Transfer Receiving Area. Multiple parcels identified in the Official Community Plan as Linked Sending Group for the CSDT Program lose their status as CSDT Sending Areas after any one of the Linked Sending Group parcels has had its Density Rights removed; only one of the Linked Sending Group parcels may be used as a Density Donor. 
c.  Transit Grid Reserve Density Transfer. Areas designated on the Community Plan as Transit Grid Reserve, if vacated of Density Rights via granting of a permanent right-of-way to the City for street construction, qualify the original lot for a density transfer sufficient to allow construction of the same number of housing units after the successful rendering to the City of the right-of-way as before. The City shall not be obligated to build such road, transitway, pedestrian path, or any other conveyance within any set period of time. However, should the City construct, have constructed, or allow the construction of such a conveyance, the resulting road and Streetscape shall be designed to the requirements of this Code. 
d.  Conservation Density Transfer. Density may be added by transfer from parcels designated as Conservation Density Transfer Program Sending Areas by their associated Official Community Plan, or by the City's Sector Plan if one is adopted. The recipient lot must be located in a Density Transfer Receiving Area designated on the associated Official Community Plan in order to be eligible to receive a Conservation Density Transfer. 
5.9.3  Building Scale Density Bonuses 
Building-scale Density Bonuses do not attach to the recipient lot; they apply only to a particular project application. Such bonuses shall be in accordance with the procedures established in Article 1. 
a.  Through-Street and Service-Alley Dedication Density Bonuses. A lot within Transect Zones T4L, T4+, T5, or T6 which is designated on the Community Plan for through-street creation qualifies for a bonus of one (1) unit additional on each of the resulting lots, up to the Absolute Maximum Density Allowance for each lot, grantable on completion of street construction and dedication. Service-alley creation and dedication similarly qualifies for a bonus of one (1) unit additional on one of the two resulting lots. Street Dedication Bonuses shall not exceed four (4) units per increment of two hundred feet of dedicated Street, nor one (1) unit per increment of one hundred feet of Service Lane or Alley length. Such a bonus designated for lots within T3 Zones shall not accrue to the designated lot but to an eligible lot within a designated Density Receiving Area specified by the owner of the original T3 lot. To qualify for this bonus, Streets and Streetscapes shall be built out according to the requirements of this Code and of the Community Plan. A lot need not be within a designated Density Bonus Receiving Area to qualify for this bonus, with the exception of a proxy recipient for T3 Zones. 
b.  Affordable Housing Density Bonus. Any lot in Transect Zones T4L, T4+, T5, or T6 which is within a Density Bonus Receiving Area designated on the governing Community Plan may build an additional 25% of the By-Right Density Allowance for that lot under the conditions that an equal number of Certified Affordable Housing units are provided in the City within one-half mile (1/2 mi) of the site, and that the Absolute Maximum Density Allowance for the lot is not exceeded. Some of the units may be constructed in the City more than 1/2 mile from the site subject to Warrant under the condition that for every required unit not located within one-half mile (1/2 mi) of the site, two units shall be created elsewhere in the City. All such units shall be distributed throughout mixed-income neighborhoods and buildings, shall not be clustered or segregated in any way. All such off-site units shall be certified by the City Architect or Urban Design Center as meeting or exceeding the architectural standards of the publication entitled "A Pattern Book for Gulf Coast Neighborhoods" or of the Architectural Guidelines established for the corresponding Neighborhoods, if such have been adopted, and off-site locations shall be approved by Warrant. Certified Affordable Housing units created pursuant to this bonus may be constructed on site, each such unit counting toward the Density Allowance for the site. Such units constructed in a T5 or T6 Zone served by Public Transit incur no additional parking requirement. The Affordable Housing Density Bonus shall conform with the procedural requirements of Article 1. 
c.  Affordable Housing Height Bonus. Any lot in Transect Zones T5 or T6 within a Density Bonus Receiving Area designated on the governing Community Plan may build one additional story in height, not to exceed the Absolute Maximum Height Limit, in exchange for the creation of eight (8) units per site acre of Certified Affordable Housing. The units must be distributed throughout the building(s) and may not be clustered or segregated in any way. Up to 75% of the units may be constructed off site if in accordance with the off-site requirements of 5.9.3b. Units constructed on-site as part of the Affordable Housing Height Bonus may not exceed the Absolute Maximum Density Allowance for the lot, and shall not contribute toward calculation of any Additional Height Allowance. The Affordable Housing Height Bonus shall conform with the procedural requirements of Article 1. 
d.  Other General Density Bonuses. Other Density Bonus programs may be created through proper planning process in accordance with state law. Under no circumstances shall the Absolute Maximum Density Limits or the Absolute Maximum Height Limits for a lot be exceeded through the use of any such program. Under no circumstances may a lot qualify for more than 25% of the original By-Right Density Allowance or more than a single additional story by a single such Density Bonus program. 
5.9.4  Additional Height Allowances hg;ol2; a. Acquired Density Allowances resulting from Density Transfers and Bonuses, excluding those provided by programs which explicitly forbid it, may generate an Additional Height Allowance (AHA) in Transect Zones T5 and T6. The AHA is an amount by which structures on the lot may exceed the general Transect Zone height limit. The AHA is determined by means of a conversion factor or Height-Density Breakpoint Table provided in the Community Plan for each Transect Zone. Under no circumstances may the total height of any structure exceed the Absolute Maximum Height Limit, independent of any Additional Height Allowance. 
b.  Total building height may be limited by additional zoning constraints imposed by overlay districts, including but not limited to the various Airport Overlay Zones. All structures must comply with applicable height-related restrictions described in this Code or in the corresponding Community Plan, regardless of any Height or Density Bonuses or Density Transfers received. 
5.10 - [RESERVED] 
5.11 - HISTORIC DISTRICTS 
5.11.1 Without limitation to any other provision hereof but supplemental thereto, no structure, building or other improvement may be installed, built, constructed or added to within an Historic District or with respect to any structure or lot designated as an Historic Site or Historic Structure except in compliance with such Historical Architectural Guidelines as may be established by the City's Historical Commission, if one has been established by an Ordinance approved by the Mayor and City Council, if such ordinance is in existence or is in the planning process, and shall be subject to approval by the City Architect and the Historical Commission. 
5.12 - PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS 
5.12.1  Damage Due to Emergency Conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained or implied herein, if a building, structure, or other improvement is damaged or destroyed by any event resulting in the declaration of an emergency or disaster applicable to the City by the Mayor and City Council, the owner of record on the date of the event may repair or rebuild such building, structure or other improvement on the same building site and with the same building footprint by right. To qualify, the building, structure, or other improvement must have been legally permitted to have been built under this or other Codes, or have legally existed as a non-conforming building, structure, or other improvement prior to the causative event; neither the lot, use, building, improvement, structure nor condition shall be added to or altered in any way, except to remedy the effects of such damage or destruction, unless such additions or alterations cause the lot, use, building, improvement, structure or condition to conform more closely with the provisions of this Code; and repair or replacement of such buildings, structures, or improvements shall be completed within one (1) year of the causative event. 
5.12.2  Pre-Existing Non-Conformity. Without limiting the foregoing, any lot, parcel, use, building, improvement, structure or condition subject to an Official Community Plan under this Code that lawfully existed upon the adoption by the Mayor and City Council of that Community Plan may continue to exist as it did, and may be repaired to such pre-existing condition. The lot, use, building, improvement, structure or condition may not be changed or added to after such date, except to conform more closely with the provisions of this Code. If the use or condition ceases for a period in excess of one (1) year, subsequent use or condition shall be fully compliant with this Code. 
5.12.3  Compliance by Virtue of Warrantable Defect. Any lot, parcel, use, building, structure, improvement, or condition which existed previous to becoming mandatorily subject to an Official Community Plan under this Code, but which fails to comply with the requirements of this Code only by virtue of a defect which, had the lot, parcel, building, structure, improvement, or condition been proposed after the adoption of such Community Plan, may have been permitted by Warrant, shall be deemed compliant with this Code and with the Official Community Plan. The Planning Official shall issue a Certificate of SmartCode Compliance for such lot, parcel, use, building, structure, improvement, or condition on application by the owner of the lot or parcel and with the provision by such owner of information and documentation as shall be required by the CRC to determine compliance. 
5.12.4  Modification of Non-Conforming Structures. The modification of existing structures is permitted by right if such changes result in greater conformance with the specifications of this Section or the requirements of the governing Official Community Plan. 
5.12.5 Any addition to or modification of a Building of Value that has been designated as such by the Planning Commission or is actually or potentially eligible for inclusion on a state, local or national historic register, including without limitation, the architectural harmony (similar materials, window proportions, color range, mass/void ratio, roof type and pitch) of such addition or modification, shall be subject to approval by the Planning Commission. 
5.13 - SPECIAL TREE PROVISIONS 
    This Code requires tree protection measures additional to those of the City of Gulfport Tree Protection Ordinance, and applies to any plan subject to this Code. The provisions of this section shall not amend or repeal any portion, part, or provision of the Gulfport Tree Protection Ordinance. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this section and those of the Gulfport Tree Protection Ordinance, the stricter shall apply. 
a.  Each plan submitted under this Code shall include a site plan showing and describing in detail by species and size all existing trees over 8 inches caliper measured at 3 feet above grade. Clusters of more than 5 such trees within a 15-foot radius may be represented in group on such plan if the cluster is to be left as is. Such plan shall indicate any trees proposed to be removed, and all proposed trees, shrubs and other landscape components. No trees shall be removed without the written approval of the Planning Official on the advisement of the City Arborist. 
b.  With the exception of certain species listed in provisions 1.7c and 1.7d, no tree over nine-inch (9") caliper measured at 3 feet above grade, shall be removed or damaged in connection with any building, development, construction, addition or other activity, provided, however, that trees in the building footprint may be removed in accordance with the City of Gulfport Tree Protection Ordinance. This requirement may be adjusted by Warrant, subject however to provisions 1.7e and 1.7f below. 
c.  Notwithstanding 1.7b, trees of species Pinus palustris (Longleaf Pine), Pinus elliottii (Slash Pine), or Pinus taeda (Loblolly Pine) under 16" caliper measured 3 feet above grade, may be removed as necessary within the building footprint or within fifty feet (50') of the building footprint without in-kind replacement. 
d.  Notwithstanding 1.7b, any trees or scrub of any size of the following types are undesirable and should be removed on account of their invasive or otherwise problematic character: Sabium sebiferum (Chinese Tallow Tree, Popcorn Tree), Cinnamomum camphora (Camphor Tree), Quercus nigra (Water Oak), Ligustrum sinense (Chinese Privet). 
e.  Each tree over 9" caliper which is damaged or removed, other than those species listed in 1.7c and 1.7d, shall be replaced elsewhere on the lot by three (3) trees of the same species having a minimum four-inch (4") caliper. Each removed pine tree of a species described in 1.7c which is 16" caliper or greater measured 3 feet above grade shall be replaced elsewhere on the lot by five (5) trees of the same species having a minimum 2-inch caliper at 3 feet, arranged in a cluster with a diameter of twelve (12) feet or less. If the lot is heavily treed so that placement of additional trees is difficult or unnecessary, the replacement trees may be contributed for use in Civic Space or for street tree use within any Community Planning Area. For street tree use in such case, the species of replacement trees may be adjusted by Warrant to match the requirements of the relevant Community Plan. 
f.  If, in implementing provision 1.7e, the same species is unavailable in the necessary size, the largest available caliper may be used, but in addition three four-inch-minimum-caliper trees of another native species, approved by Warrant, shall be planted on the parcel. 
g.  Removal of trees contrary to the provisions of this Code shall require replacement at the rate of 2 caliper inches of in-kind replacement, measured at 3 feet above grade, for every caliper inch inappropriately removed, measured at the top of the residual stump or 3 feet above grade or as estimated by the City Arborist, with replacement trees of at least 2-inch caliper, to be adjusted by Warrant. 
h.  It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, organization or society to violate the provisions of this article. The removal or destruction of each protected tree shall constitute a separate offense under this article, and said violation or violations, if deemed by the City Arborist to be willful, may in addition to the penalties provided by 5.13g be prosecuted and punishable in accordance with Section 1-9 of the City of Gulfport Code of Ordinances. 
5.14 - SUCCESSION 
    Ten years after the approval is granted for a Community Plan, and every ten years thereafter, at the request of residents or property owners within the Community Planning Area, each Transect Zone, except the T1 Natural and the T2 Rural, shall be considered for rezoning in whole or in part to the successional (next higher numbered) Transect Zone through public consultation and at the recommendation of the Planning Commission through public hearing after 15 days advance published notice, and by approval of the Mayor and the City Council. Until such rezoning is complete, zoning for each Transect Zone shall remain unchanged. 
ARTICLE 6. - STANDARDS AND TABLES 
    The Tables and their associated metrics are an integral part of this Code. Like the preceding text pages, they are meant to be law after calibration and adoption. During calibration, individual Tables may be removed if not needed, and individual metrics may be adjusted for local character and custom.

ARTICLE 7. - DEFINITIONS OF TERMS 
    This Article provides definitions for terms in this Code that are technical in nature or that otherwise may not reflect a common usage of the term. If a term is not defined in this Article, then the Planning Commission shall determine the correct definition of the term. 
DEFINITIONS 
    Absolute Maximum Building-Scale Density: A parameter of a Transect Zone or district which conveys the maximum number of Equivalent Housing Units per unit Lot-Level Area which can be constructed on lots within the district or Zone, independent of how the Density Rights were acquired. For each lot in the district the Absolute Maximum Building-Scale Density, along with the lot's area, determines the Absolute Maximum Density Allowance for the lot. 
    See Maximum Building-Scale Density. 
    Absolute Maximum Density Allowance: The maximum number of Equivalent Housing Units which may be constructed on a lot through any means, including by Right, by Density Transfer, or by Density Bonus. The Absolute Maximum Density Allowance is determined by multiplying the appropriate Absolute Maximum Building-Scale Density by the area of the lot. Under no circumstances may a lot's Density Allowance exceed the lot's Absolute Maximum Density Allowance. 
    See also Lot Density Allowance, By-Right Density Allowance. 
    Acquired Density Allowance: A number of Equivalent Housing Units which may be constructed on a lot as a result of acquisition of Density Rights through Density Transfer or Density Bonus. The Lot Density Allowance is the sum of the Acquired and By-Right Density Allowances. 
    Advisory Flood Hazard Area: One of several Flood Hazard Areas which may be identified and regulated by the City of Gulfport's Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance. See the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance for a detailed description. 
    Additional Height Allowance: A number of Stories beyond the Maximum By-Right Height Limit for the assigned Transect Zone which may be constructed on a lot within a Density Receiving Area as a result of obtaining a particular Acquired Density Allowance. The relationship between a particular Additional Height Allowance and the Acquired Density Allowance which permits it is determined by the Height-Density Breakpoint Table of the Community Plan. 
    See also Height-Density Breakpoint Table. 
    Affordable Housing: Dwellings consisting of rental units or for-sale units which are economically accessible to a family earning 100% or less of Area Median Income, where economic accessibility is defined to mean that rent (in the case of rental units) or mortgage, amortization, taxes, and property insurance (in the case of for-sale units) consume 30% or less of the family's gross income (33% where Unbundled parking must be secured). 
    Affordable Housing Agreement: A set of written agreements between an applicant for a development, the City, and an Approved Affordable Housing Provider or public housing authority arranging for the production of one or more units of Certified Affordable Housing, with the applicant for development responsible for the production of the units and the AAHP or public housing authority agreeing to manage the resulting units as Certified Affordable Housing units in accordance with the requirements of Section 1.7.1 of this Code.

A lot may have only one Principal Frontage, but may have several Secondary Frontages, each corresponding to a different street bounding the lot. See also Principal Frontage. 
    Sector: A neutral term for a geographic area. In the SmartCode there are six specific Sectors that establish the legal boundaries for several kinds of development. Two Sectors represent unbuildable open space (Preserve and Reserve) and the other four are Urban Growth Sectors of varying intensity (Restricted, Controlled, Intended and Infill Growth Sectors). Sectors address the legal status of place at the regional scale while Transect Zones address the physical character of communities. Sectors contain Community Types (CLD, TND, RCD, TOD), which contain Transect Zones, which contain design standards appropriate to those T-Zones. 
    Service Boundary Line: The extent of potential or feasible urban growth as determined by the extension of infrastructure, principally sewer.

    Sharing Factor: A coefficient greater than or equal to 1.0 representing the degree to which a single physical parking space may provide needed parking for two distinct Functions, if freely shared. For example, a Sharing Factor of 1.4 for a pair of Functions indicates that ten parking spaces shared between those functions serve as effectively as would seven spaces dedicated to each Function in isolation. Sharing Factors for Function Pairs are tabulated in Table 12. 
    Shopfront & Awning: A private Frontage Type characterized by a Facade aligned close to the Frontage Line with the building entrance at sidewalk grade, a substantial amount of glazing at sidewalk level, and an awning that may overlap the full extent of the sidewalk.

    Variance: A ruling that would permit a practice that is not consistent with a provision of this Code, but is consistent with the overall the intent of this Code and the Comprehensive Plan in light of unique conditions on the site. Also referred to as a SmartCode Variance to distinguish it from a variance under the Existing Local Code, which may require a different procedure. 
    Viewshed: An area within, or critical to the provision of, a scenic or valued view from a Civic Space, transit corridor, or another space within the public realm. 
    Village: A Village is usually a TND Community Type standing isolated in the country-side, but with a stronger center than a hamlet due to its proximity to a transportation corridor. See: TND. 
    Ward Representative: A member of the CRC representing one of the Wards of the City of Gulfport.

    Warrantable deviation: A deviation which may be approved by Warrant in compliance with this Code. 
    Work-Live: A fee-simple mixed-use unit with a substantial Commercial component that may accommodate employees and walk-in trade. Work-Live units allow more intensive non-residential usage and are therefore allowed only in Zones T4, T5, and T6, subject to the combined requirements of both the residential and the non-residential uses. In particular this subjects Work-Live units to ADA requirements and parking requirements more stringent than those imposed on Live-Work units. See Live-Work.
