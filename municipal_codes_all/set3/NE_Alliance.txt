    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Alliance, Nebraska. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1986 Code, as supplemented through September 15, 2011, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1986 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Shelly Hayes, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. J. D. Cox, City Manager, and Ms. Linda S. Jines for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(2)  Failure to perform an act that is required to be performed by ordinance or by rule or regulation authorized by ordinance.

(d)  Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent injunctive relief or nuisance abatement. Action by the city to abate a nuisance does not prevent imposition of a penalty for a violation of this Code. Whenever, in any action, it is established that a nuisance exists, the court may together with the fine or penalty imposed, enter an order of abatement as part of the judgment in the case. 
(e)  Any person violating any of the provisions of this Code making gambling illegal or in any other way dealing with gambling upon conviction thereof, shall be fined as hereinbefore provided; and, as part of the judgment of conviction, all gambling equipment and paraphernalia seized and exhibited in court, shall be ordered confiscated and destroyed.

If any provision of this Code is declared to be inapplicable to specific property by a valid judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not restrict the applicability of such provision to other property. 
Sec. 1-10. - Provisions deemed continuation of existing ordinances.

Prior to the decision of the city manager to reinstate the employee or remove, demote, discharge, or suspend the employee, with or without pay, the city manager shall within a reasonable period of time investigate the alleged misconduct, charges, or grounds against the employee and explain the basis of the employer's evidence to the employee and provide the employee an opportunity to present his or her version of the circumstances which resulted in the filing of the written accusation. 
(4)  If the city manager's investigation reveals other misconduct, charges, or grounds the city manager shall direct the complainant chief to amend the written accusation to include the other misconduct, charges, or grounds by filing an amendment to the written accusation with the city manager who shall cause a copy of such amended accusation to be delivered after the filing as provided in a. above.

(5)  Upon completion of this procedure the city manager may make one of the following findings to resolve the alleged misconduct, charges, or grounds set forth in the written accusation: (1) to be without merit, (2) to not warrant disciplinary action, (3) to warrant disciplinary action less severe than removal, demotion, discharge, or suspension, with or without pay, such as an oral or written reprimand, or (4) to warrant removal, demotion, discharge, or suspension, with or without pay. 
(6)  City manager's response. If the city manager's determination comes under [subsection (5), (4)] above, within five calendar days after making a decision, the city manager shall file a copy of his or her decision with the secretary of the commission who shall follow the same procedure as provided in a. written accusation above.

The failure to file such a request shall constitute a waiver of the employee's right to review by the civil service commission and the city manager's decision shall become final. 
(c)  Employee's responsibilities after filing appeal . Simultaneously with filing the demand for investigation and public hearing, the employee shall mail or deliver the following upon the city manager and secretary of the civil service commission: 
(1)  A response to the statement of the charge(s);

The commission may be represented in such investigation and public hearing by the city attorney if authorized by the city manager. If the city attorney does not represent the commission, the commission may be represented by special counsel appointed by the commission for any such investigation and hearing. The investigation shall consist solely of a review of the written submissions of the city manager and employee to determine whether any individuals or documents should be subpoenaed by the commission for the subsequent public hearing before the commission ultimately to determine whether the city manager acted in good faith for cause. Good faith for cause shall mean that the action was not arbitrary or capricious and was not made for political or religious reasons. 
(f)  Public hearing conducted on employee's appeal . The commission shall schedule a public hearing no less than ten nor more than 20 calendar days from the date of filing of the employee's written demand for an investigation. The commission shall notify the city manager and employee in writing at least five calendar days prior to the date of the hearing, of the date, time and place of the hearing. Both parties shall be permitted to appear in person and by counsel and to present his or her case and may present evidence by testimony and documents and shall be permitted to cross-examine witnesses. A decision shall be rendered no later than ten calendar days after the hearing. 
(g)  Commission's finding . The commission may affirm the action taken by the city manager if such action is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. If the commission finds that the removal, suspension, demotion or discharge was made for political or religious reasons or was not made in good faith for cause, it shall order the immediate reinstatement or reemployment of such employee in the position or employment from which such employee was removed, suspended, demoted, or discharged, which reinstatement shall, if the commission in its discretion so provides, be retroactive and entitle such person to compensation and restoration of benefits and privileges from the time of such removal, suspension, demotion, or discharge. 
After the hearing, in lieu of affirming the removal, suspension, demotion, or discharge, the commission may modify the order of removal, suspension, demotion, or discharge by directing a suspension, with or without pay, for a given period and the subsequent restoration to duty or demotion in position or pay. No later than ten calendar days after the hearing the commission shall certify its findings in writing to the employee and the city manager who shall enforce them. 
(h)  Appeal . If such judgment or order be concurred in by the commission or a majority thereof, the accused or governing body may appeal to the district court according to Nebraska Statutes.

(g)  AMWS will not supply permanent water service until: the customer's application for service shall have been approved by AMWS; all necessary permits shall have been obtained by the customer; inspection has been approved as set forth by the city manager or designee; and AMWS shall find it practicable to render such service. 
(h)  All customers desiring permanent metered water service shall make application for service and enter into such contracts for service as may from time to time be required by AMWS. All applications for permanent metered water service shall be made in the true name of the customer actually to receive such service, unless otherwise permitted by AMWS and the use of a fictitious name by the prospective customer shall be sufficient reason for refusal or termination of service. 
(i)  Any change in the identity of the customer of record at the premises shall require a new application and AMWS may discontinue the water supply until such new application has been made and accepted by AMWS. In the event the customer fails to make the required applications for service, the customer using and benefitting from such service shall be subject to all rules, regulations and tariffs and liable for all charges for services rendered.

Sec. 28-372. - AMSS-Installation procedure. 
(a)  In making excavations in streets, alleys or sidewalks for the purpose of installing pipe, or making repairs, the contractor must first get a permit from the building and zoning office. The paving, stones and earth must be removed and deposited in a manner that will least inconvenience to the public and provide for adequate drainage. No person shall leave an excavation made in the street, alley, or sidewalk open at any time without a barricade and during the night, warning lights. After the house sewer is laid the public ways and property shall be restored to good condition. If the excavation in the public ways and property is left open or unfinished for a period of 24 hours or more, AMSS shall have the duty to finish or correct the work and all expenses so incurred shall be charged to the owner occupant, or lessee of the property. All installations or repairs of pipes require two inspections by the building inspector. The first inspection shall be made when connections or repairs are complete and before the pipes are covered. The second inspection shall be made after the dirt work is completed and the service restored. It is the customer's responsibility to notify the building inspector at the time the work is ready for each inspection. The applicant for sewer service to a premise not currently serviced by AMSS shall pay to the building inspector at the time making an application for new service a permit charge in the amount established by the city. The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of AMSS. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply. 
(b)  Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. 
(c)  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of AMSS, or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and the WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight, and verified by proper testing. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the AMSS before installation. Any defective or other noncompliant work shall, upon written notice, be promptly remedied.

(2)  The purpose of creating reserves for any of the aforesaid purposes. 
(b)  Such use charges, including the collection thereof, shall be as hereinafter provided. 
(Code 1986, § 4-501; Ord. No. 1907, 10-22-1987; Ord. No. 2350, 3-18-1999) 
Sec. 28-447. - Classification. 
    The city council may classify for the purpose of sewer use charges the customers of AMSS; provided, such classifications are reasonable and do not discriminate unlawfully against any consumer of group of consumers. 
(Code 1986, § 4-637; Ord. No. 2350, 3-18-1999) 
Sec. 28-448. - Rates-Generally. 
(a)  For the use of AMSS each user shall pay a monthly charge which shall be computed and based upon the users contribution of sewage to AMSS, as set by the city council. 
(b)  The monthly residential user contribution to AMSS shall be considered equal to an average monthly water consumption during a three-month winter base beginning with the first complete cycle which uses meter readings taken after December 15. If a residential contributor has not established a winter base period, the monthly user charge shall be the average charge of all other residential contributors. The billing process shall commence when water service is started for existing locations and upon the issuance of a certificate of occupancy on a newly constructed premises or when the utility customer service office gains knowledge that a newly constructed location is occupied, whichever comes first. 
(c)  The contribution of sewage from a commercial user shall be considered equal to the amount of water consumed as shown by the current water billing plus any water used from other than AMWS as estimated or determined as provided by this division. Commercial customers with summer irrigation or similar nonsewer system contributing water usage may elect to have their sewer usage rates computed on the same basis as residential customers as described in subsection (b) of this section. 
(d)  All fractions of a month shall be charged and considered as a full month. 
(Code 1986, § 4-503; Ord. No. 1907, 10-22-1987; Ord. No. 1987, 3-15-1990; Ord. No. 2038, 1-9-1992; Ord. No. 2350, 3-18-1999) 
Sec. 28-449. - Same-Schedule. 
(a)  Sewer charges. Sewer charges shall be as established by the city. The total sewer use charges shall consist of two components: a customer charge and the sewer use charge. 
(b)  Sanitary sewer tap fee. In order to recover labor and materials for tapping of lines, a tap fee in the amount established by the city shall be charged at the time the city main is tapped. 
(c)  Minimum charge per month. 
(1)  Regardless of how little water is used, there shall be a minimum sewer use charge per month to each user of AMSS, determined by the cost incurred in billing each sewer user, this minimum charge per month is the customer charge. 
(2)  In the case when water service cannot be disconnected by customer request because of an inoperable or broken water curbstop, the minimum sewer use charge will be billed to the property owner. Billings continue until repair or replacement of the curbstop is made, the utility customer service office is notified of the remedy and the disconnection of water service has been accomplished. The superintendent is directed to provide timely notice to the property owner of the condition that will lead to the minimum billing. 
(d)  Customers not connected to AMWS. The sewer use charge per month for users connected to AMSS but not connected to AMWS shall be the average charge of other like users. 
(e)  Exception to standard calculation methods. 
(1)  When customers change at a given location and AMSS determines that to compute the sewer use charge for a billing period upon the amount of water used by a customer would be inequitable to the city or the user, an average charge of other like users may be used. 
(2)  If a customer can demonstrate to AMSS that a substantial portion of water consumed does not contribute to the sanitary sewer system then that water may be excluded from the sewer use charge calculation. 
Generally, water contributing to the sanitary sewer is metered by the customer separately from other water uses. The configuration must be approved by AMSS before installation. All meters must conform to the standard found at section 28-450 and may be tested by AMSS if deemed necessary, at the customer's cost. It shall be the customer's responsibility, or the owner's responsibility, if the owner is not also the customer, to maintain the meter in good repair and safe working order. 
(f)  Inspection charge. As agreed to prior to issuance of permit. 
(g)  Annual rate adjustment. Commencing October 1, 2013 and annually thereafter all sewer customer charges and sewer use rates shall be automatically increased by one percent for all customers unless increases in excess of one percent are specifically authorized by the city council.

(Ord. No. 2826 , § 1, 11-1-2016)  
Sec. 103-3. - Airport hazard area. 
(a)  An airport hazard area is hereby established. The airport hazard area consists of all approach zones, operations zones, transition zones and turning zones of the Alliance Municipal Airport. The dimensions and location of the airport hazard area is more specifically depicted and set out in exhibit A, incorporated herein by reference. Exhibit A may be amended from time to time by resolution of the city council of the city, if necessary to reflect any subsequent change to the airport hazard area. 
(b)  Except as otherwise provided by chapter 103, and except as necessary to airport operations, no structure or tree shall be constructed, altered, maintained, or allowed to grow in the airport hazard area so as to project above the height restrictions within the various zones composing the airport hazard area. Any structure or tree projecting above the height restrictions shall be an airport hazard. Where two or more zones composing the airport hazard area cover any one area, the more constricting height restriction shall apply. 
(c)  The restrictions imposed by section 103-3(b) of chapter 103 shall apply to the airport hazard area, notwithstanding the fact that some portions of the airport hazard area lie outside of the city's municipal limits. The height restrictions imposed by section 103-3(b) shall not exceed the boundaries of the airport hazard area. 
(Ord. No. 2826 , § 1, 11-1-2016)  
Sec. 103-4. - Airport hazards. 
(a)  All airport hazards are prohibited. No airport hazard shall be built, constructed, planted, allowed to grow, or placed by any person, individual, or entity. 
(b)  Uses of land and structures or trees located within the airport hazard area and in compliance with the height restrictions may nonetheless be considered airport hazards. The city reserves the right to consider all structures or trees within the airport hazard area in compliance with the height restrictions to be airport hazards. The determination of whether any structures or trees within the airport hazard area are in compliance with the height restrictions are airport hazards shall be made after considering whether the structures or trees present a material danger to the safe landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft or the safety of persons using or near any aircraft. 
(c)  Uses of land and structures or trees located outside the airport hazard area may nonetheless be considered airport hazards. The city reserves the right to consider all other structures or trees outside the airport hazard area to be airport hazards. The determination of whether any structures or trees outside the airport hazard area are airport hazards shall be made after considering whether the structures or trees present a material danger to the safe landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft or the safety of persons using or near any aircraft. 
(d)  The provisions of chapter 103 supplement all other comprehensive zoning regulations and land use restrictions. All comprehensive zoning regulations and land use restrictions applicable to areas outside the airport hazard area remain in effect. 
(Ord. No. 2826 , § 1, 11-1-2016)  
Sec. 103-5. - Existing nonconforming use. 
(a)  The provisions of chapter 103 shall not require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any existing nonconforming use. The burden of establishing and showing an existing nonconforming use, and the right to continue the same, shall be upon the individual, entity, or person asserting that the structure or tree occupies such status. 
(b)  No existing nonconforming use shall be substantially changed, altered, repaired, or replanted unless a permit for such change, alteration, repair, or replant is obtained under the provisions of chapter 103. Provided, however, no permit is necessary under this subsection for repairs to any existing nonconforming use if the repair is required by fire, explosion, act of God, or common enemy or if the repairs do not cost more than 60 percent of the fair market value of a structure, so long as the height of the repaired ore replanted nonconforming structure or tree does not increase over its preexisting height. A permit may be granted only upon a showing by the applicant that the excess height of the preexisting nonconforming use does not establish or create an airport hazard or will not allow the preexisting nonconforming use to become a greater airport hazard than it was before the change, alteration, repair, or replant. 
(c)  An electrical facility made nonconforming by the adoption or amendment of chapter 103 may, without a permit under chapter 103, be repaired, altered, reconstructed, or replaced if the height of the electrical facility is not increased over the preexisting height. Any such repair, alteration, reconstruction, or replacement that increases the height shall require a permit under chapter 103, and the permit may be granted only upon a showing by the applicant that the excess height of the electrical facility will not establish or create an airport hazard or will not allow the electrical facility to become a greater airport hazard than it was before the repair, alteration, reconstruction, or replacement. 
(d)  An electrical facility that has not yet begun construction but has received, before January 1, 2015, zoning approval from the governing entity exercising zoning jurisdiction over such electrical facility, may be constructed and be considered an existing nonconforming use under section 103-5 of chapter 103. 
(e)  The city reserves the right to acquire by purchase, grant, or condemnation an air right, aviation easement, or other estate or interest in the property upon which an existing nonconforming use is located, if necessary to effect the purpose of chapter 103. 
(Ord. No. 2826 , § 1, 11-1-2016)  
Sec. 103-6. - Permits and variances. 
(a)  Before any preexisting nonconforming use can be changed, altered, repaired, or replanted, a permit must be secured from the city manager and/or designee. No permit shall be granted for any change, alteration, repair, or replant unless the applicant shows that the structure or tree does not establish or create an airport hazard or the structure or tree will not become a greater airport hazard than it was before the change, alteration, repair, or replant. 
(b)  Any person, entity, or individual desiring to build any structure, plant or permit the growth of any tree, increase the height of any structure, or otherwise use property in a manner not in compliance with the provisions of chapter 103 shall apply to the board of adjustment for a variance before building any structure, planting or permitting the growth of any tree, or increasing the height of any structure. Such variance shall be allowed only where the applicant shows all of the following: 
(1)  Strict compliance to chapter 103 would produce an undue hardship. 
(2)  Such hardship is not generally shared by other properties in the vicinity and also subject to chapter 103. 
(3)  Such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and the purposes of chapter 103 will not be neglected by the granting of the variance. 
(4)  Such variance is based upon reason of demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for purposes of convenience, profit, or caprice. 
(c)  No variance shall be authorized unless the board of adjustment finds that the condition or situation of the property concerned, or the intended use of the property, is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to chapter 103. 
(d)  The board of adjustment or the city manager and/or designee, as the case may be, may impose reasonable conditions to the granting of a variance or permit that is deemed necessary to accomplish the purposes of chapter 103. Conditions may include, but are not limited to, requiring the owner of the structure or tree to permit the city, at the city's cost, to install, operate, and maintain such markers and lights necessary to indicate the presence of an airport hazard to aircraft using an airport. 
(Ord. No. 2826 , § 1, 11-1-2016)  
Sec. 103-7. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Unless otherwise designated in chapter 103, the city manager and/or designee shall be the administrative agency or official charged with enforcing the provisions of chapter 103, including the power to review and act upon all applications for permits under chapter 103. 
(b)  Unless otherwise designated in chapter 103, the board of adjustment shall have and exercise the following powers: 
(1)  To hear and decide appeals from any final order, requirement, decision, or determination of the city manager and/or designee in the enforcement of chapter 103. 
(2)  To hear and decide any and all special exceptions to the provisions of chapter 103, if such exceptions are required to be heard by chapter 103. 
(3)  To hear and decide all applications for variances from the strict application of chapter 103. 
(c)  The concurring vote of four members of the board of adjustment shall be necessary to preserve any final order, requirement, decision, or determination of the city manager and/or designee, or to decide in favor of an applicant for any matter on which an applicant is seeking action from the board of adjustment under sections 103-7(b)(2) and 103-7(b)(3) of chapter 103. 
(d)  Each violation of the provisions of chapter 103 shall constitute a class IV misdemeanor, and a separate offense shall occur for each day a violation continues. The city may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent, correct, or abate any violation of the Airport Zoning Act, chapter 103, or any other order, ruling, or decision made in connection with the enforcement of the Airport Zoning Act or chapter 103. The city may seek an injunction proper under the facts and circumstances of each case. 
(Ord. No. 2826 , § 1, 11-1-2016)  
Sec. 103-8. - Appeal. 
(a)  Any person, entity, or individual aggrieved or taxpayer affected by any final order, requirement, decision, or determination of the city manager and/or designee in the enforcement of chapter 103 shall appeal to the board of adjustment by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk and with the board of adjustment. The notice of appeal shall be filed no later than ten days after the final order, requirement, decision, or determination. Upon filing the notice of appeal, the city manager and/or designee shall transmit to the board of adjustment all records and papers related to the matter upon which the appeal is taken. Failure to file a timely notice of appeal shall waive the right to appeal any such final order, requirement, decision, or determination of the city manager and/or designee. 
(b)  The board of adjustment shall set a reasonable time and date for the hearing of all appeals and the hearing of all applications for variance, not to exceed 30 days after the date upon which the notice of appeal was filed or the application for variance was submitted. The board of adjustment shall give notice of the time and date for hearing to the party appealing the final order, requirement, decision, or determination of the city manager and/or designee or to the party applying for a variance. The board of adjustment shall render a decision within 30 days of any hearing. 
(c)  An appeal to the board of adjustment under chapter 103 shall stay any proceeding to further the final order, requirement, decision, or determination of the city manager and/or designee, unless the city manager and/or designee certifies to the board of adjustment after the notice of appeal has been filed that a stay would, in the city manager's and/or designee's opinion, cause imminent danger to life or property. Where the city manager and/or designee certifies that the stay would cause imminent danger to life or property, all proceedings will not be stayed unless the board of adjustment orders such a stay after notice to the city manager and/or designee and a showing of due cause for the stay. 
(d)  In accordance with the Nebraska Revised Statutes, any person, entity, or individual aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected, may obtain judicial review of any decision of the board of adjustment by filing a petition in error with the district court of any county in which a structure or tree is subject to such decision. Such petition in error shall allege that the decision of the board of adjustment is arbitrary or capricious, illegal, or unsupported by evidence. The city may obtain judicial review of any decision of the board of adjustment by filing a petition in error with the district court of any county in which a structure or tree is subject to such decision. Such petition in error shall allege that the decision of the board of adjustment is arbitrary or capricious, illegal, or unsupported by evidence. 
(e)  If any provision of chapter 103 should be declared by any court to be unconstitutional, unenforceable, or invalid, such declaration shall not affect the validity the remainder of chapter 103, or of chapter 103 as a whole. 
(Ord. No. 2826 , § 1, 11-1-2016)  
Sec. 103-9. - Notice. 
(a)  Notice of any hearing or any final order, requirement, decision, or determination to any person, entity, or individual under chapter 103 may be provided by any of the following methods: 
(1)  Personal delivery to the person, entity, or individual. 
(2)  Sent by first-class mail addressed to the last known address, or in the case of a hearing following a notice of appeal, to the address provided on the notice of appeal. 
(3)  If notice cannot be provided personally and if the notice sent by first-class mail is returned showing the notice was not delivered, a copy of the notice may be posted in a conspicuous place on the property to which the hearing or the order, requirement, decision, or determination applies, and if so posted, the notice shall also be published one time in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the city. The notice becomes effective on the first day after notice of such hearing, or of such order, requirement, decision, or determination, is published. 
(b)  Any notice posted on the property shall be at least 18 inches in height and 24 inches in width, with a white background and black letters. It shall contain a description of the matter involving the hearing or the order, requirement, decision, or determination. Any notice published in the daily newspaper shall contain and be addressed to the legal description of the property subject to the hearing, or the order, requirement, decision, or determination, and shall contain a description of the matter involving the hearing, or the order, requirement, decision, or determination.

(5)  Excavations shall not be made so close to property lines as to endanger adjoining property without supporting and protecting such property from erosion, sliding, settling or cracking. 
(6)  No fill is to be placed where it will slide, or wash upon the premises of another or so placed adjacent to the bank of a channel as to create bank failure or reduce the natural capacity of the stream. 
(7)  Fills are to consist of material from cut areas, borrow pits or other approved sources. 
(8)  Timber, logs, brush, rubbish and vegetable matter which will interfere with the grading operation or affect the planned stability of fill areas shall be removed and disposed of according to the plan. 
(9)  Topsoil is to be stripped and stockpiled in amounts necessary to complete finish grading of all exposed areas requiring topsoil for the establishment of vegetation. 
(10)  Fill material is to be free of brush, rubbish, rocks, logs and stumps that will be detrimental to constructing stable fills. 
(11)  Cut slopes which are to be topsoiled will be scarified to a minimum depth of six inches prior to placement of topsoil. 
(12)  All fills intended to support buildings, structures, paving, sewers and conduits are to be compacted, as specified, with proper moisture control. Compaction of other fills may be required to reduce slipping, erosion or excess saturation. 
(13)  Frozen materials or soft, mucky or easily compressible materials are not to be incorporated in fills intended to support buildings, parking lots, road paving, structures, sewers or conduits. 
(14)  Maximum thickness of layers of fills to be compacted are not to exceed eight inches, or as designated by the city manager or designee. 
(15)  All areas are to be rough graded to within 0.2 foot of the planned elevation after allowance has been made for thickness of topsoil, paving or other installations.

(b)  Alley intersection. In case of intersecting "T," or angle-turn alleys, a cutoff shall be required of at least ten feet measured along each lot line, measured from the point of intersection of the alley lines. 
(c)  [Topography.] Streets must conform to existing topography as nearly as possible in order that drainage problems may be reduced. Streets shall, wherever possible, follow valleys so as to form a collection system for surface water. Surface drainage across residential lots or along the side or rear lot lines shall be avoided wherever possible. Where such drainage on residential lots is necessary, easements shall be provided and the city manager or designee may require installation of pipe, masonry or rip rap flumes, or such other protective devices in order that adjacent or surrounding property or the welfare of the public shall not be endangered and maintenance will be kept at a minimum. Streets with reverse curves shall have a tangent (or straight line) between curves. 
(d)  Comprehensive plan.

State Law reference Conflicts between zoning ordinances and other ordinances, R.R.S. 1943, § 19-914.  
Sec. 109-4. - Application of zoning ordinance. 
No building, structure, or land shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in conformity with all of the zoning ordinance herein specified for the district in which it is located. Any use not listed herein may be placed in a suitable district classification by the city council after recommendation of the planning commission. 
(Ord. No. 2880 , § 5(Exh. A), 3-5-2019)  
Sec. 109-5. - Existing zoning violations; saving clause. 
All rights or remedies of the city are expressly saved as to any and all violations of previous zoning regulations or amendments thereto of said city that have accrued at the time of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived; and that all existing violations of previous zoning regulations which would otherwise become legal nonconforming uses under this chapter shall not become legal nonconforming uses under this chapter, but shall be violations of this chapter in the same manner that they were violations of prior zoning regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2880 , § 5(Exh. A), 3-5-2019)  
Sec. 109-6. - Nonconforming uses and buildings. 
(a)  Storage and signs. The lawful use of a lot of record for storage purposes or advertising signs and which contains no buildings, and which use for storage or signs is not permitted by this Code, or by an amendment thereto, shall not be enlarged and shall be discontinued within five years from the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or any amendment thereto. 
(b)  Continuance. The use of a building, structure, or land, existing and lawful at the time of the adoption of this zoning ordinance, or at the time of an amendment to the zoning ordinance or zoning district map, may, except as provided in this section, be continued, although such use does not conform with provisions of the zoning ordinance or amendment; and such use may be extended throughout the same building if no structural alteration of such building is proposed or made for the purpose of such extension. 
(c)  Change of use. If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a building or lot may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or lower classification, or to a conforming use; such use shall not thereafter return to a nonconforming use of a higher classification or, if said use was made to be conforming it may not return to a nonconforming use. 
(d)  Discontinued. In the event that a nonconforming use of any building or premises is discontinued or its normal operation stopped, for a period of 12 months, such right to the nonconforming use shall be forfeited and any future use of the building and premises shall conform to the zoning ordinance. 
(e)  Destroyed or damaged. When a nonconforming building or a building containing a nonconforming use is damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or the public enemy to the extent of 75 percent or more of its fair market value, it shall not be restored, rebuilt, or repaired unless it is made to conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. If a nonconforming building or building containing a nonconforming use is damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or the public enemy to the extent of less than 75 percent of its fair market value, it may be restored, provided such restoration is completed within 12 months from the date of destruction and further provided that any necessary litigation shall not be counted as part of the 12 months allowed for restoration. The board of adjustment may grant variances relative to restoring such buildings provided said variances are of a minor nature such as yard, height, or parking requirements and provided that the board, after public hearing, is convinced that property values in the neighborhood will not be jeopardized and that substantial justice will be done. 
(f)  Enlarged. A nonconforming use of a building may not be enlarged, extended, nor may the building be enlarged or altered unless such enlargement or alteration is made to conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located, provided, however, a use or building containing a nonconforming use may be enlarged or altered by variance from the board of adjustment after public hearing proving a hardship exists that meets the following requirements: 
(1)  Such use is a legal, preexisting, nonconforming use. 
(2)  Such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district and the same vicinity. 
(3)  The expansion will not be of substantial detriment to the adjacent property and the character of the district will not be changed. 
(4)  The hardship shall be distinguishable from variations for the purpose of convenience, profit, or caprice. 
The structure shall not be enlarged an amount greater than 25 percent of its original ground coverage area. Once the structural additions reach 25 percent of the original ground coverage area, no further expansion shall be allowed.

(a)  Generally. Each of the residential, commercial, or industrial districts (R-R to M-3 inclusive) set forth in this zoning ordinance shall have a separate and distinct counterpart, known, and herein referred to as a planned residential, planned commercial, or planned industrial district. A planned district shall be for the purpose of permitting and regulating the uses heretofore permitted in the equivalent district, and shall further provide for and encourage latitude and flexibility in the location of buildings, structures, roads, land uses, drives, variations in yards and common open spaces subsequent to the approval of the plan by the planning commission and city council. The intent is to allow development of tracts of land to their fullest extent, and at the same time observe the general intent and spirit of these regulations. Densities would be calculated over the entire development rather than on a lot-by-lot basis. 
(b)  Planned residential districts. 
(1)  Planned residential districts may be permitted as follows: 
Planned District 	Equivalent District 
RP-R 	R-R 
RP-1 	R-1

(2)  In general, the height and bulk of buildings, the amount of open space, the parking and loading requirements shall be equal to those in the equivalent district, except that off-street parking and set back requirements in district PCBD shall be the same as in C-2. The uses permitted and the performance standards shall be the same as the equivalent district. This district may be used to provide for and encourage the grouping of business or residential buildings into centers in keeping with modern concepts of office center, service center, shopping center, or industrial park design. The further intent and purpose shall be to reduce the need for strips of commercial development along thoroughfares, and to encourage centers and clusters offering the equivalent in goods and services. 
(d)  Procedure. A tract of land may be rezoned to a district RP-R through MP-3 inclusive, only upon application by the owner or his agent, and only after the approval of both preliminary and final development plans for the tract; however the rezone application may be processed at the same time as the final development plan. 
(1)  The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the preliminary development plan as prepared in subsection (e) of this section. If the preliminary development plan is found to be consistent with the city comprehensive plan and is acceptable to the planning commission, in form and supporting data, the plan shall be approved. 
(2)  After the planning commission's approval of the preliminary development plan, the final development plan, construction drawings, and a rezone application shall be submitted to the planning commission and either approved or disapproved as to compliance with the preliminary development plan. The final development plan and rezoning application shall be processed in the same manner as is typical for rezoning applications. 
(e)  Development plan requirements. The applicants of a planned development shall prepare and submit to the planning commission, preliminary, and final development plans that contains the following elements, except for the PCBD zone which shall have its own set of special requirements. 
(1)  The property lines of the tract to be developed and the adjacent tracts for a distance of not less than 300 feet.

ARTICLE I. - USE REQUIREMENTS  
DIVISION 1. - ABANDONED CHURCH OR SCHOOL BUILDINGS 
 
Sec. 111-1. - Generally. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The abandoned church or school building regulations contained herein are intended to allow greater flexibility in the use of abandoned church and school buildings which are located in "R" residential zoning districts by the use of the conditional use permit process which subjects the property to certain standards and criteria as permitted herein. 
(b)  Abandonment defined. A church or school shall be considered abandoned if the denomination, school district, or private agency responsible for operating the church or school provides written documentation that the church or school building is no longer feasible for its original purpose and that serious efforts to market the property for use as another church or school or another permitted use in the zoning district have been exhausted. 
(c)  Demolition. The listed uses in section 111-2 shall only be authorized in an existing church or school building. If the rehabilitation of the existing building is found to be economically infeasible and proposed to be demolished, the vacant property shall not be used for the construction of a new building housing any of the herein listed conditional uses. After demolition of the existing building, the vacant property shall only be used for a use authorized as a permitted use in that zoning district. 
(d)  Fences and vision clearance. All side lot lines and rear lot lines adjacent to a one-family dwelling shall be screened by a closed fence as permitted in chapter 111, division 4 of this Code, or a compact evergreen hedge which meets the same requirements as a closed fence. 
(Ord. No. 2880 , § 5(Exh. A), 3-5-2019)  
Sec. 111-2. - Conditional uses. 
The following conditional use(s) may be authorized, subject to the provisions set forth for conditional use permits found in chapter 111, article III of the Alliance Municipal Code:

The following uses on the property are not permitted and shall be considered a violation of the conditional use permit and subject to planning commission review and possible revocation by city council: 
(1)  Additions, alterations, and improvements. There shall be no addition to the existing building without planning commission review and approval. Any other alterations or improvements to the structure shall comply with all applicable regulations of the "R" zoning district in which it is located, and with the adopted city construction codes. 
(2)  Retail sales. There shall be no retail sales to the general public as a principal use on the premises, other than those authorized as business services. Retail sales of small quantities of supplies essential to the operation of a commercial school or training center may be offered as an accessory use.

Sec. 111-4. - Traffic management. 
(a)  Traffic control. Ingress, egress, and traffic circulation on the site shall be designed to minimize the impacts on neighboring residential properties. Designated off-street parking may be required. Proposals for receipt of deliveries by truck shall be evaluated to determine the safety of the truck parking and unloading area, its compatibility with adjacent residential uses and the impact of its location on the free flow of traffic on the public street. 
(b)  Off-street parking. The following table shall be used as a guideline by the planning commission in determining the number of off-street parking spaces required for each of the proposed uses: 
Minimum Number of Off-street Parking Spaces 
Use 	Number of Spaces 
Business or professional offices 	3.55.5 spaces for each 1,000 sq. ft. of gross floor area 
Business services 	1 space for each 250 sq. ft. of gfa 
Commercial school, conference center or training center 	1 space for each employee plus 1 space for each 3 seats in an auditorium or meeting room; 1 space for each 300 sq. ft. of office space; and 1 space for each 75 sq. ft. of net floor area in a dining room or cafeteria 
Community center 	30% of seating capacity in an auditorium, gymnasium or activities/meeting room; 1 space for each 300 sq. ft. of office or counseling area; 1 space for each 75 square feet of nfa in a dining room or cafeteria 
Day care center 	1 space for each employee 
Theater 	30% of seating capacity 
 
(c)  Reduced number of spaces. In the event that the required parking cannot be met on the site of the church or school, the planning commission may approve on-street or other public parking to meet part of the total required spaces or may approve off-site parking within a reasonable distance of the site, subject to submission of evidence of a long-term lease agreement with the landowner.

Secs. 111-21111-40. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 3. - AGRICULTURE ESTATE DWELLING SITE (AEDS) 
 
Sec. 111-41. - Intent. 
It is not the intent of this Code to encourage the creation of a large number of AEDS, but rather allow the transfer and use of a smaller portion of a larger tract of land, whereby the smaller tract is platted and created to be used primarily for a dwelling site without requiring a rezone. 
(Ord. No. 2880 , § 5(Exh. A), 3-5-2019)  
Sec. 111-42. - Process. 
The administrative process and approval of an AEDS shall be the same as that of a rezone. The ordinance approving the AEDS, and an agreement signed by the property owner of the AEDS and the owner of the remaining minimum 80 acre tract, shall be filed at the Box Butte County Courthouse. Such agreement shall act to bind any subsequent owners of both tracts to the requirements of this Code. Any tract proposed to be created shall be subject to the same preliminary and final platting process as all other subdivisions of land. 
(Ord. No. 2880 , § 5(Exh. A), 3-5-2019)  
Sec. 111-43. - Preexisting requirements. 
The AEDS tract must consist of one or more of the following conditions: 
(1)  A parcel 82.5 acres or more with an existing vacant dwelling and accessory buildings on farm or ranch land. 
(2)  A parcel 82.5 acres or more which would allow the conveyance of a smaller portion of the property to be used for dwelling purposes. 
(3)  A parcel 82.5 acres or more used in agricultural production containing, with a smaller portion of marginal, unproductive land therein, not exceeding 20 acres, that may be used exclusively for dwelling purposes unrelated to the agricultural production. 
(Ord. No. 2880 , § 5(Exh. A), 3-5-2019)  
Sec. 111-44. - Tract requirements. 
(a)  AEDS tract size. 
Minimum Lot Size (acres) 	Maximum Lot Size (acres) 	Minimum Lot Width (feet) 	Minimum Lot Depth (feet) 
2.5 	20 	150 	200 
 
(b)  Remaining tract size. The entire tract of land being subdivided shall be a minimum of 82.5 acres before the creation of the AEDS. The larger portion of land, after creation of the AEDS, may continue to include another dwelling associated with the agricultural production on the land. This minimum 80 acre tract shall be reserved for as long as the land is zoned Ag, Agriculture. One AEDS shall be allowed per each 82.5-acre tract of land. 
(c)  Shape. Each proposed AEDS shall be shaped and located to allow the accurate platting on the official zoning map of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2880 , § 5(Exh. A), 3-5-2019)  
Sec. 111-45. - Transportation. 
Each proposed AEDS without frontage or access along a public road shall have a dedicated access road or access easement at least 25 feet in width to a public road. Access roads serving different AEDS shall be separated by a minimum of 1,000 feet between them, measured along the public road. New driveways shall also be approved by the Box Butte County Road Superintendent or Nebraska Department of Transportation, whichever is applicable. 
(Ord. No. 2880 , § 5(Exh. A), 3-5-2019)  
Sec. 111-46. - Other considerations. 
The planning commission and city council shall take into consideration the effects of the AEDS on utilities, roads, drainage, etc., as well as adjacent zoning districts and potential growth patterns of the city to ensure the approval does not limit the city's growth. 
(Ord. No. 2880 , § 5(Exh. A), 3-5-2019)  
Sec. 111-47. - Discontinuation. 
In the event that the AEDS is no longer used for the purpose herein described or if the conditions in the AEDS agreement filed at the Courthouse are violated, the approval granted by the city shall automatically be revoked. Any person(s) violating this Code or the AEDS agreement shall be prosecuted by the city in the same manner as other zoning code violations.

Such space shall not be located in the required front yard or side-yard setback areas, shall be free of any restraints from other utilities or parked vehicles, and must be accessible to collection trucks. Parking stalls occupied by containers will not count towards the required minimum number of off-street parking spaces. In the event the property is served by a commercial solid waste disposal firm, placement of the collection containers must be approved by the city. However, this is not intended to restrict the temporary placement of roll-out containers moved to the curb or alley for solid waste collection purposes. 
(r)  Nonconforming parking lots.

Any and all violations of previous parking regulations of said city that have accrued at the time of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived which would otherwise become legal nonconforming uses under this chapter shall not become legal nonconforming uses under this chapter, but shall remain violations of this chapter in the same manner that they were violations of prior parking regulations. 
(2)  Legal preexisting. All off-street parking lots in existence at the time of the passage of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall be considered legal preexisting, nonconforming parking lots if they met the requirements before its passage but no longer meet the new requirements. These lots shall be allowed to remain provided the use of the facility for which they are intended does not change in occupancy classification and they are maintained in good condition, free of all weeds, trash, other debris, and water pools or puddles. 
(3)  Alterations and additional off-street parking stalls shall meet the newly adopted standards.
