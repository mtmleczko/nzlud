1-1-4: CONSTRUCTION OF WORDS:
Whenever any word in any section of this code importing the plural number is used, in describing or referring to any matters, parties, or persons, any
single matter, party, or person shall be deemed to be included, although distributive words may not have been used.
When any subject matter, party or person is referred to in this code by words importing the singular number only, or the masculine gender, several matters,
parties, or persons and females, as well as males, and bodies corporate shall be deemed to be included. Provided, that these rules of construction shall
not be applied to any section of this code which contains any express provision excluding such construction or where the subject matter or content may be
repugnant thereto. (1961 Code)
1-1-5: DEFINITIONS:
KNOWINGLY: A person acts knowingly with respect to conduct or to a circumstance described by an ordinance defining an offense when he is aware of
his conduct or that the circumstance exists. A person acts knowingly with respect to the result of conduct described by a statute defining an offense when
he is aware that it is highly probable that such result will be caused by his conduct. When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of
an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence. Equivalent terms such as "knowing" or "with
knowledge" have the same meaning.
NEGLIGENTLY: A person acts negligently with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by an ordinance defining an offense when he
consciously disregards a risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists or when he disregards a risk of which he should be aware that the
result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that to disregard it involves a gross deviation from the
standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation. "Gross deviation" means a deviation that is considerably greater than
lack of ordinary care. Relevant terms such as "negligent" and "with negligence" have the same meaning.
OFFICER: Shall include officers and boards in charge of departments and the members of such boards, and such reference as use of the word "city" shall
mean this municipality, "clerk" or "treasurer" and others shall mean the city clerk or city treasurer, as the case may be applicable.
OWNER: Applied to a building or land shall include any part owner, joint owner, tenant in common, joint tenant or lessee of the whole or of a part of such
building or land.
PERSON: To include any person, firm, association or corporation, or any organization of any kind.
PERSONAL PROPERTY: Includes every description of money, goods, chattels, effects, evidence of rights in action, and all written instruments by which
any pecuniary obligation, right or title to property is created, acknowledged, transferred, increased, defeated, discharged or diminished, and every right or
interest therein.
PURPOSELY: A person acts purposely with respect to a result or to conduct described by an ordinance defining an offense if it is his conscious object to
engage in that conduct or to cause that result. When a particular purpose is an element of an offense, the element is established although such purpose is
conditional, unless the condition negatives the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense. Equivalent terms such as "purpose"
and "with the purpose" have the same meaning.
STREETS: Includes alleys, lanes, courts, boulevards, public ways, public squares, public places, sidewalks, public parking areas, within the corporate
limits of the city and contained within the limits of the Lewistown City-County airport.
TENANT OR OCCUPANT: Applied to a building or land shall include any person who occupies the whole or any part of such building or land whether
alone or with others.
WRITTEN AND IN WRITING: May include printing. (1961 Code; amd. Ord. 1590, 10-1-1990)
Words prohibiting anything being done, except in accordance with a license or permit or authority from a board or officer, shall be construed as giving such
board or officer power to license or permit or authorize such thing to be done. (1961 Code)
If, in this code the term "wilfully" is used or found, such word shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the definition of "purposely" as
contained herein. (Ord. 1590, 10-1-1990)
1-1-6: INTERPRETATIONS:
In the determination of the provisions of each section of this code the following rules shall be observed:
(A) Intent To Defraud: Whenever an intent to defraud is required in order to constitute an offense, it shall be sufficient if an intent appears to defraud any
person.
(B) Liability Of Employers And Agents: When the provisions of any section of this code prohibit the commission of an act, not only the person actually
doing the prohibited act or omitting the directed act, but also the employer and all other persons concerned with or in aiding or abetting the person shall
be guilty of the offense described and liable to the penalty set forth. (1961 Code)

under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so
incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance takes effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform to the

waiving any right of the city under any ordinance or provision thereof in force at the time of adoption of this code. (1961 Code)

penalty were specifically declared in the section forbidding such act or declaring the same to be unlawful or prescribing the duty or imposing the obligation
and where any duty is prescribed or obligation imposed, or where any act which is of a continuing nature is forbidden or declared to be unlawful, a
separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.

which to proceed; but not more than one recovery shall be had against the same person for the same offense; provided, that the revocation of a license or

by the city clerk and treasurer upon the books of the city, separate from all of its other funds, designated as the water system improvement fund, and shall
be deposited and secured as provided in section 3-3-15 of this chapter. From this fund there shall be paid as incurred all such items as constitute, in
accordance with sound practices, proper costs of the bond undertaking, as provided in the plans and specifications therefor; including, but without
limitation, all engineering, inspection, fiscal and legal expenses, the cost of lands and easements, the reimbursement of any advances heretofore made by
the city, and all other expenses heretofore incurred and to be incurred in connection with the financing and construction of such undertaking. All other
monies granted to or appropriated by the city for the undertaking shall likewise be credited to this fund. The monies in the fund shall be used only for the
purposes set forth in this section, except that if any monies shall remain after the completion of the undertaking and after payment of all costs thereof, such
remaining monies shall be transferred to the water system fund. (Ord. 1483, 3-3-1982)
3-3-15: WATER SYSTEM FUND:
So long as any of the principal of or interest on any bonds issued for the maintenance and/or construction of the waterworks system of the city shall be
outstanding and unpaid, or until there shall have been set apart in the revenue bond account established in subsection (B) of this section, a sum sufficient
to pay when due, or to redeem prior to maturity, the entire principal of such bonds remaining unpaid, together with interest accrued and to accrue thereon
to maturity or to the earliest date upon which they may be redeemed according to their terms, the city irrevocably covenants with the holders of each and
all bonds that all of the gross revenue derived from the operation of its water system will be accounted for, applied and disposed of in the manner provided
in this section, and will be deposited and secured as provided for in this chapter. Such gross revenues are hereby defined to include all income and
receipts derived from rates, charges and rentals imposed for connections with and for the use of such system, including all additions thereto and
betterments and replacements thereof originally or subsequently constructed or acquired, or for the benefits provided by the facilities of the system, or
from sales of property acquired in connection therewith, and all penalties and interest on such rates, charges and rentals, but shall not include any special
assessments levied for the construction of water mains or other improvements. All gross revenues shall be paid daily, as received by the city, into the
water system fund, which fund shall at all times be segregated and maintained by the city clerk and treasurer on the books of the city as a separate and
special fund. This fund shall be subdivided into the separate accounts described below and the gross revenues received in the fund shall be appropriated
once in each calendar month, or as often as collections permit, but in no event less than once in each calendar quarter, which appointment is hereinafter
referred to as the "periodic apportionment". The gross revenues received in the fund shall be credited to the respective accounts and accounted for therein
and expended therefrom as follows: (Ord. 1483, 3-3-1982)
(A) Operating Account: On each periodic apportionment there shall first be set aside and credited to the operating account, as a first charge on the gross
revenues, such amount as may be required over and above the balance then held in the account to pay the reasonable and necessary operating
expenses of the system which are then due and payable, or are to be paid prior to the next periodic apportionment. The term "operating expenses"
shall mean the current expenses, paid or accrued, of operation, maintenance and current repair of the water system and its facilities as calculated in
accordance with sound accounting practice, and shall include, without limitation, administrative expenses of the city relating solely to the water system,
premiums for insurance on the properties thereof, labor and the cost of materials and supplies used for current operation and for maintenance, and
charges for the accumulation of appropriate reserves for current expenses which are not recurrent monthly, but may reasonably be expected to be
incurred in accordance with sound accounting practices. Such expenses shall not include any allowance for depreciation or renewals or replacements
of capital assets of the system and shall not include any portion of the salaries or wages paid to any officer or employee of the city, except such
portions as shall represent reasonable compensation for the performance of duties necessary to the operation of the water system. There shall also be
credited to this account all additional sums collected since the last periodic apportionment, until there has been accumulated therein an operating
reserve in the amount of three thousand five hundred dollars ($3,500.00), which sum shall be maintained by additional transfers upon each periodic
apportionment whenever necessary, or may be augmented by transfers of additional amounts from the surplus account described below if determined
by the city commission to be necessary to meet contingencies arising in the operation and maintenance of the system. Monies in the operating account
shall be used solely for the payment of current operating expenses of the water system as herein defined.
(B) Revenue Bond Account: The net revenues of the municipal water system, as referred to herein, are hereby defined to include the entire amount of
such gross revenues remaining upon each such periodic apportionment, after crediting to the operating account the amount required in subsection (A)
of this section, including sums required to create and maintain the operating reserve at the minimum amount therein stated. Upon each periodic
apportionment there shall be set aside and credited to the revenue bond account out of the net revenues an amount equal to not less than one-twelfth
(1/12) (or if the periodic apportionment is not monthly, then that fraction which is obtained by dividing the number of months since the last periodic
apportionment by 12) of the total sum of the principal and interest to become due within the then next succeeding twelve (12) months on all bonds
outstanding and on all bonds refunding the same (exclusive of principal and interest for the payment of which funds have been placed in escrow); and
of the remaining net revenues on hand there shall also be credited to the revenue bond account a sum equivalent to one thousand two hundred fifty
dollars ($1,250.00) for each month since the last periodic apportionment, until there shall have been accumulated in the account an additional reserve
which shall thereafter be maintained by the transfer of additional net revenues whenever necessary, in an amount at all times at least equal to the
maximum amount of principal and interest to fall due on all bonds within any subsequent fiscal year. Monies from time to time held in the revenue bond
account shall be disbursed only to meet payments of the principal and interest on such bonds as such payments become due, and the reserve therein
shall be used only to pay maturing principal and interest when other monies within the account are insufficient therefor; provided, that if in any periodic
apportionment there is apportioned to such reserve an amount in excess of the amount required to be apportioned, that excess may be credited

It is the policy of the city to ensure that new developments or projects are adequately served by the public water system, and further, that the costs of
upgrading or renovating the system to accommodate such developments or projects be equitably and fairly apportioned between existing and anticipated
users of the system.
(A) Applicability: The terms of this section apply to any single development or project whereby it is estimated that the water requirements for such
development or project would exceed the existing capacity or unduly burden the existing water system, making it necessary or advisable to upgrade or
renovate any portion of the system.
This section does not apply to situations whereby a project or development causes an extension of service, except in situations where any portion of
the existing system requires upgrading or renovation, notwithstanding the fact that an extension of service occurs.
(B) Assessment: The developer, or other person or entity which builds or constructs any applicable development or project, shall pay a fee to the city
based upon the projected twenty (20) year design flow of water through the renovated or upgraded system. The amount of the fee shall be a
percentage of the total cost of upgrading or renovating the system equal to the percentage of the twenty (20) year design flow through the upgraded or
renovated system by the development or project.
Costs incurred in excess of the assessment fee will be paid by the utility from the replacement fund described in subsection 3-3-15(C) of this chapter.
(C) Projections And Estimates: The utility is solely responsible for making projections or estimates of flow rates. Such projections and estimates shall be
based upon recognized generally accepted practices or methods.
(D) Payment, Connection Fees: Payment of the fee assessed herein shall be made prior to the commencement of construction of the required upgrading
or renovation. Upon payment of the assessed fee, any connection charges, which would otherwise be owing to the utility, shall be waived. (Ord. 1516,

4-6-9: SEWER USE RATES:
(A) Purpose: The purpose of this section shall be to generate sufficient revenue to pay all costs for the operation and maintenance of the complete
wastewater system. The costs shall be distributed to all users of the wastewater system in proportion to each user's contribution to the total loading of
the treatment works. Factors such as strength (BOD and SS), volume and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included as the
basis for the user's contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of operation and maintenance costs to each user (or user class).
(B) Standard Charges: For all premises the charge for service rendered and made available by the sewerage system shall be as follows:
1. Base Rate Charge: Effective July 1, 2006, a base rate of twelve dollars fifty cents ($12.50) shall be assessed for each sewer tap that is connected to
the municipal sewerage system. This base rate shall be in addition to charges assessed for residences not metered or not connected to the water
system and for charges based upon metered use. Effective July 1, 2009, such base rate shall be twelve dollars eighty one cents ($12.81) per sewer
tap.
(a) The sewer base charge shall be collected for each sewer tap regardless of any connection, active or inactive, to the city water system.

2. Residences Not Metered Or Not Connected To The Water System: All residential dwelling units, including single-residential units, each unit of
multiple-residential units, and each mobile home unit, which is connected to the Lewistown municipal sewerage system and is either nonmetered for
water use or is not connected to the city's water system shall be assessed a minimum monthly sewer use charge of thirty three dollars eighty two
cents ($33.82) effective August 1, 2003, fifty dollars seventy three cents ($50.73) effective July 1, 2004, and fifty two dollars ($52.00) effective July 1,
2009.
3. Charges Based On Metered Use: Each user, residential, commercial or industrial, which is connected to the Lewistown municipal sewerage system
and is metered for water use, shall be assessed a sewer use charge of three dollars forty three cents ($3.43) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of
water used effective August 1, 2003, four dollars ninety six cents ($4.96) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water used effective July 1, 2004, and
five dollars eight cents ($5.08) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water used effective July 1, 2009. The sewer use charge of each class of user
shall be computed as follows:
(a) Residential: The sewer use charge is computed by taking the average amount of water as billed for the months of January, February and March
of each year, multiplied by the current sewer use rate. Months showing no usage shall not be included in the calculation. For those utility
customers that show no water use for the billing periods of January, February or March as a result of the property being vacant, the sewer use
charge shall be computed using an average of two thousand (2,000) gallons per month.
(b) Commercial: Each user in this classification will be assessed a sewer use charge based on actual water use throughout the year. However, those
users utilizing water for irrigation and which have a separate meter for this water, will be assessed a sewer use charge based only on total water
used, less the water used for irrigation.
4. Nonresidential Users: Any nonresidential user with BOD and SS strengths greater than the average residential user's strength of two hundred
milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) BOD and two hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l) SS will pay a surcharge in accordance with the rates shown in
the surcharge rate structure.
5. Roof Drains: Each premises with a roof drain which discharges stormwater or any other clear waters directly into the sanitary sewer shall be
assessed a sewer user charge of two dollars twenty four cents ($2.24) per one thousand (1,000) square feet of roof area per month effective August
1, 2003, three dollars thirty six cents ($3.36) per one thousand (1,000) square feet of roof area per month effective July 1, 2004, and three dollars
forty four cents ($3.44) per one thousand (1,000) square feet of roof area per month effective July 1, 2009.
6. Availability Of Sewerage Service: Sewerage service shall be deemed available to each premises connected to the municipal sewerage system and
to each premises which abuts upon any street, alley or public place in which a sewer main is located.
(C) Surcharge Rate Structure For Above Normal Strength Wastes: The city, or its engineer, will determine the average total suspended solids (SS) and five
(5) day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) daily loadings for the average residential user or in lieu of such a determination will consider the average
residential strength wastes to be two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) BOD and two hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l) SS.
The city, or its engineer, will assess a surcharge rate for all nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and SS strengths greater than the
average residential user. The surcharge will be sufficient to cover the costs of treating such users' above normal strength wastes. Such users will pay
an additional service charge of nineteen and seven-tenths cents ($0.197) per one thousand (1,000) gallons for each twenty five milligrams per liter (25
mg/l) over two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) of BOD and ten cents ($0.10) per one thousand (1,000) gallons for each twenty five milligrams
per liter (25 mg/l) over two hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l) SS effective August 1, 2003. Such users will pay an additional service charge of
thirty cents ($0.30) per one thousand (1,000) gallons for each twenty five milligrams per liter (25 mg/l) of BOD and fifteen cents ($0.15) per one
thousand (1,000) gallons for each twenty five milligrams per liter (25 mg/l) over two hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l) SS effective July 1,
2004.

4-6-10: DETERMINING THE TOTAL ANNUAL COST OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE:
The city or its city engineer, shall determine the total annual costs of operations and maintenance of the wastewater system which are necessary to
maintain the capacity and performance, during the service life of the treatment works, for which such works were designed and constructed. The total
annual cost of operation and maintenance shall include, but need not be limited to, labor, repairs, equipment, replacement, maintenance, necessary
modifications, power, sampling, laboratory tests and a reasonable contingency fund. (Ord. 1508, 2-21-1984)
4-6-11: DETERMINING EACH USER'S WASTEWATER CONTRIBUTION PERCENTAGE:
The city, or its city engineer, shall determine each user's average daily volume of wastewater which has been discharged to the wastewater system, which
shall then be divided by the average daily volume of all wastewater discharged to the wastewater system, to determine each user's volume contribution
percentage. The amount used as the total average daily volume of wastewater shall exclude infiltration and inflow. The city, or its city engineer, shall
determine each user's average daily poundage of five (5) day twenty degree centigrade (20C) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) which has been
discharged to the wastewater system which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of all fifty (50) day BOD discharge to the wastewater
system to determine each user's BOD contribution percentage.
The city, or its city engineer, shall determine each user's average suspended solids (SS) poundage which has been discharged to the wastewater system
which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of all suspended solids discharged to the wastewater system to determine the user's
suspended solids contribution percentage. Each user volume contribution percentage, BOD contribution percentage and suspended solids contribution
percentage shall be multiplied by the annual operation and maintenance costs of wastewater treatment of the total volume flow of the total fifty (50) day
twenty degree centigrade (20C) BOD and of the suspended solids respectively. (Ord. 1508, 2-21-1984)
4-6-12: DETERMINING A SURCHARGE SYSTEM FOR USER WITH EXCESS BOD AND SS:
The city, or its city engineer, will determine the average suspended solids (SS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) daily loadings for the average
residential user. The city, or its city engineer, will assess a surcharge rate for all nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and SS strengths
greater than the average residential user. Such users will be assessed a surcharge sufficient to cover the costs of treating such users' above normal
strength wastes. Normal strength wastes are considered to be two hundred (200) ppm BOD and two hundred fifty (250) ppm SS. (Ord. 1508, 2-21-1984)
4-6-13: DETERMINING EACH USER'S WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE:
Each nonresidential user's wastewater treatment cost contributions as determined in sections 4-6-11 and 4-6-12 of this chapter shall be added together to
determine such user's annual wastewater service charge. Residential users may be considered to be one class of user and an equitable service charge
may be determined for each user based upon an estimate of the total wastewater contribution of this class of user. The governing body may classify
industrial, commercial and other nonresidential establishments as a residential user, provided that the wastes from these establishments are equivalent to
the wastes from the average residential user with respect to volume, suspended solids and BOD. (Ord. 1508, 2-21-1984)
4-6-14: PAYMENT OF THE USER'S WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE AND PENALTIES:
The city shall submit an annual statement to the user for the user's annual wastewater service charge or one-twelfth (1/12) of the user's annual wastewater
service charge may be included with the monthly water and/or wastewater utility billing. The city shall add a penalty of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per
month if the payment is not received by the city within fifteen (15) days. Should any user fail to pay the user wastewater service charge and penalty within
three (3) months of the due date, the city may stop the wastewater service to the property. (Ord. 1508, 2-21-1984)
4-6-15: REVIEW OF EACH USER'S WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE:
The city shall review the total annual cost of operation and maintenance as well as each user's wastewater contribution percentage not less often than
every two (2) years and will revise the system as necessary to assure equity of the service charge system established herein and to assure that sufficient
funds are obtained to adequately operate and maintain the wastewater treatment works. If a significant user, such as an industry, has completed in-plant
modifications which would change that user's wastewater contribution percentage, the user can present, at the regularly scheduled meeting of the
governing body, such factual information and the city shall then determine if the user's wastewater contribution percentage is to be changed. The city shall
notify the user of its findings as soon as possible. (Ord. 1508, 2-21-1984)
4-6-16: NOTIFICATION:
Each user will be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with a regular bill of the rate and that portion of the user charges which are attributable to
wastewater treatment service. (Ord. 1508, 2-21-1984)

4-6-24: POLICY STATEMENT:
It is the policy of the city to ensure that new developments or projects are adequately served by the public sewer system, and further, that the costs of
upgrading or renovating the system to accommodate such developments or projects be equitably and fairly apportioned between existing and anticipated
users of the system.
(A) Applicability: The terms of this section apply to any single development or project whereby it is estimated that the wastewater discharge from such
development or project would exceed the existing capacity or unduly burden the existing wastewater system, making it necessary or advisable to
upgrade or renovate any portion of the system.
This section does not apply to situations whereby a project or development causes an extension of service, except in situations where any portion of
the existing system requires upgrading or renovation, notwithstanding the fact that an extension of service occurs. (Ord. 1514, 6-18-1984)
(B) Assessment: The developer, or other person or entity which builds or constructs any applicable development or project, shall pay a fee to the city
based upon the projected twenty (20) year design flow of wastewater discharge through the renovated or upgraded system. The amount of the fee
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=567 52/283
shall be a percentage of the total cost of upgrading or renovating the system equal to the percentage of the twenty (20) year design flow discharged
through the upgraded or renovated system by the development or project. (Ord. 1555, 12-15-1986)
(C) Projections And Estimates: The utility is solely responsible for making projections or estimates of flow rates. Such projections and estimates shall be
based upon recognized generally accepted practices or methods.
(D) Payment, Connection Fees: Payment of the fee assessed herein shall be made prior to the commencement of construction of the required upgrading

SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
5-26-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, morals, and the general welfare of the citizens of the
city of Lewistown to establish reasonable uniform regulations to prevent the continued deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented
businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly it is neither the intent nor effect of these regulations to restrict or deny access by
adults to distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of these regulations to
condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials. (Ord. 1725, 3-16-2009)
5-26-2: FINDINGS AND DETERMINATIONS:
The Lewistown city commission hereby finds and determines that:
(A) The establishment of adult uses in business districts which are immediately adjacent to and which serve residential neighborhoods has a deleterious
effect on both the business and residential segments of the neighborhood, causing or contributing to blight and a downgrading of property values.
(B) The establishment of more than two (2) adult uses within three hundred feet (300') of each other has a deleterious effect on surrounding residential
and business areas and the fostering of such businesses within a close proximity tends to create a "skid row" atmosphere.

adversely affects property values, causes an increase in crime and encourages residents and businesses to move elsewhere.
(D) Concern for, and pride in, the orderly planning and development of a neighborhood should be encouraged and fostered in those persons comprising
residential and business segments of that neighborhood. (Ord. 1725, 3-16-2009)

SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS
11-4-1: SUPPLEMENTAL AREA, YARD AND HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS:
The following requirements provide exceptions or qualify and supplement the specific district regulations set forth in chapter 3 of this title:
(A) Building Groups: In any residential district, more than one principal structure housing a permitted use may be located on a single lot or combination of
lots; provided, that:
1. A minimum of ten feet (10') is maintained between principal structures.
2. Side yard setbacks are provided between adjacent properties as required in the district.
3. Front yard setbacks as required in the district are provided on side streets when a side street frontage exceeds one hundred fifty feet (150').
4. Principal structures are set back from alleys a minimum of twenty feet (20').
(B) Height Exceptions: The following requirements supplement those specific district regulations set forth in chapter 3 of this title:
1. The height limitations contained in the district land use requirements table shall not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, antennas, water towers or
tanks, chimneys or smokestacks, power transmission lines, cooling or elevator towers, or similar and necessary appurtenances not used for human
occupancy.
2. Churches, schools, hospitals, nursing or rest homes, or public buildings may exceed the height limitations of the district if the minimum depth of the
side and rear yard setbacks are increased one foot (1') for every two feet (2') by which the structure exceeds the height limitation of the district.
(C) Permitted Projections: In all residential districts, the following projections shall be permitted to extend into or over the required yard area; provided, that
the building or structure to which such projection is attached does not infringe into the required yard area:
1. Fireplaces and bay windows not to exceed two feet (2').
2. Roof overhangs, eaves, gutters, cornices or other architectural features not to exceed eighteen inches (18").
3. Open exterior stairways or decks not to exceed two feet (2') into the side yard nor four feet (4') into the front yard.
(D) Yards And Setbacks For Accessory Buildings In Residential Districts: The following setbacks shall be provided for accessory buildings in residential
zones:
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=567 223/283
1. Detached garages and carports shall be set back six feet (6') from the dwelling, three feet (3') from a side or property line, and three feet (3') from a
rear property line without street or alley frontage.
2. Detached garages and carports shall be set back zero feet (0') from an alley property line except for garages and carports that have their approach
at a right angle to the alley which shall be set back six feet (6') from the alley property line and ten feet (10') from the side street property line.
3. Detached or attached garages and carports with their approach from any street frontage shall be set back twenty feet (20') from the front and/or ten
feet (10') from the side property line, or must meet the front and side yard requirements for the district in which they are located, whichever is most
restrictive.
4. Detached tool or storage sheds, playhouses, greenhouses or other accessory buildings shall be set back three feet (3') from a side property line,
three feet (3') from a rear property line without street or alley frontage, zero feet (0') from an alley property line and ten feet (10') from a side street
property line.
(E) Lot Sizes: Lots created before and after the effective date of this title shall conform to all of the applicable requirements of the zoning district in which
the property is located.
(F) Required Yards: No part of a yard or other open space required about or in connection with any building for the purpose of complying with this title shall
be included as part of a yard or other open space for any other building.
(G) Division Of Lot: A recorded lot or combination of lots can only be divided into smaller lots upon special review conforming to the Montana subdivision
and platting act; new lots must conform to all of the applicable regulations of the zoning district in which the property is located.
(H) Access For Buildings: All buildings and structures shall have access to a public or approved private street. A street shall provide the primary means of
pedestrian access for any dwelling unit. Alleys shall provide only a secondary means of access. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-4-2: LANDSCAPING:
The intent of landscaping is to enhance, conserve and stabilize property values by encouraging aesthetically appealing surroundings and relieving heat,
wind and glare through proper tree planting and vegetative cover development and maintenance. Yards abutting streets in districts R-1, R-2, R-3, RMO,
and P-I should be landscaped. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-4-3: FENCES, WALLS AND HEDGES:
(A) Height: Except as otherwise required by this code, fences, walls and hedges may be erected or maintained in any residential, commercial, or industrial
zoning district along any required yard; provided, that no solid fence, wall or hedge over three feet (3') in height shall be erected or maintained on any
street frontage. Fences not exceeding four feet (4') in height may be erected along street frontage provided they are constructed of chainlink or other
material which provides for an unobstructed view and is approved by the building official. Fences, walls or hedges located along side or rear yards not
fronting streets shall not exceed six feet (6').
"Height", for the purpose of this section, shall be defined as the vertical distance from the top rail, board or wire to the ground directly below. A base
elevation shall be established.
(B) Visibility At Intersections: Corner lots in all zones shall not be permitted to have any fences, walls, hedges or other sight obstruction over three feet (3')
in height in the area designated as the "clear view triangle". This area can be determined by measuring eighty feet (80') from the center of two (2)
intersecting streets along the centerline of each street, then connecting the two (2) points with a straight line forming the hypotenuse of the clear view
triangle. Trees within the clear view triangle, including those located within the public right of way, shall have branches removed at the trunk from
ground level to a minimum of seven feet (7') above the ground level. Shrubs or hedges within the clear view triangle shall be maintained no higher than
three feet (3') above the established top of curb grade.
Regardless of other provisions of this section, no fences, walls or hedges shall be erected or maintained in any yard which materially impedes vision of
vehicles entering an abutting street.
(C) Prohibited Fences: No barbed wire or other sharp fencing materials and no electrically charged fences shall be erected or maintained in any district.
Barbed wire fencing materials may be used as part of a fence in a commercial or industrial zoning district when such material is located not less than
six feet (6') above grade. (Ord. 1726, 7-6-2009)
(D) Prohibited Location: No fence, wall or hedge shall be erected or maintained in any public right of way unless as allowed in title 9, chapter 15 of this
code. (Ord. 1726, 7-6-2009; amd. Ord. 1744A, 9-4-2012)
(E) Prohibited Materials: All fences shall be constructed from approved fencing materials and shall not be constructed from railroad ties, rubble or salvaged
material. (Ord. 1726, 7-6-2009)
11-4-4: SWIMMING POOLS; ENCLOSURE:
All swimming pools, excluding baby pools and hot tubs shall be enclosed with a fence or wall not less than three feet (3') in height. The fence or wall must
not have an opening larger than four inches (4") in any direction, other than doors or gates. All doors and gates shall be equipped with a self-latching
device for keeping the door or gate securely fastened at all times when not in actual use. The door of any dwelling which forms part of the enclosure for
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=567 224/283
private residential pools/hot tubs need not be so equipped. Yard fences will satisfy the enclosure requirement.
The building inspector may allow individual modifications regarding fence height and composition whenever a hardship exists and safety will not be
compromised. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-4-5: CURB, GUTTER, SIDEWALKS; RESIDENTIAL ZONES:
In all established residential zones (R-1, R-2, R-3, RMO), portland cement concrete sidewalks, or other hard surfacing as approved by the building official,
and portland cement concrete integral curb and gutter shall be constructed at the time of any new residential construction. This shall be in conformance
with the most current city of Lewistown standards. This section shall apply as follows:
(A) When any vacant lot or tract of record is developed, curb, gutter and sidewalks shall be required.
(B) When a building or residence is razed for the purpose of new construction, curb, gutter and sidewalks shall be required. (Ord. 1723, 10-20-2008)
11-4-6: CURB, GUTTER, SIDEWALKS; COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES:
In commercial zoning districts, portland cement concrete sidewalks, portland cement concrete driveways at all access locations, or other hard surfacing as
approved by the building official, and portland cement concrete integral curb and gutter shall be constructed at the time of improvements of property in
conformance with the most current city of Lewistown standards. In industrial zoning districts, portland cement concrete integral curb and gutter shall be
constructed at the time of improvements of property; however, portland cement concrete sidewalks and driveways shall be required whenever adjoining
property is similarly developed. (Ord. 1723, 10-20-2008)
11-4-7: ACCESS FOR ALL STRUCTURES:
Every building hereafter erected or moved shall be placed on a lot adjacent to a public street or with access to an approved private street (approval
granted by the board of adjustment only). All structures shall be located on lots so as to provide safe, convenient access for servicing, fire protection and
required off street parking, except under chapter 11, "Planned Unit Development (PUD)", of this title. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-4-8: MULTI-UNIT DWELLINGS; SEPARATE ENTRANCES:
Each unit in a multi-family dwelling shall have a separate entrance. Any structure of two (2), three (3) or four (4) dwelling units which does not provide this
shall be classified as an apartment house. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-4-9: ZERO LOT LINE CONDITIONS:
Where an individual owns two (2) adjoining lots, a zero lot line may be used for a single-family dwelling, but only so as to create a lot line on one side of
any lot. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-4-10: LOTS IN TWO ZONES:
Where a district boundary line as established in this title divides a lot which was in single ownership and of record at the time of this title, the use thereon
and the district requirements applying to the least restricted portion of such lot under this title shall be considered as extending to the entire lot; provided,

Chapter 7
HOME OCCUPATIONS
11-7-1: INTENT:
It is the intent of this chapter to provide for occupations conducted as secondary uses in dwelling units. It is further intended that through the establishment
of approval criteria and compliance procedures, the basic character of all residential neighborhoods will be maintained. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-
1989)
11-7-2: DEFINITION:
A "home occupation" is an activity conducted as a secondary use in a dwelling unit for purposes other than storing materials. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-
15-1989)
11-7-3: STATEMENT OF POLICY:
A home occupation permit is strictly personal to the grantee and does not create a vested right which runs with the land, nor can the grantee transfer
permit use to another residence without reapplication. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-7-4: APPROVAL CRITERIA:
Before approval for a home occupation is granted, the zoning coordinator shall find that the proposed use meets the following requirements:
(A) No person other than members of the family residing on the premises may be engaged in such occupation.
(B) The use of the dwelling unit for the home occupation must be clearly incidental and subordinate to its use for residential purposes by its occupants and
shall be confined to not more than twenty five percent (25%) of the total floor area of the main dwelling unit. A home occupation shall not be conducted
within any accessory structure.
(C) There may be no change in the outside appearance of the building or premises or other visible evidence of the conduct of the home occupation.
(D) Home occupations shall not take up space which is required parking for the dwelling unless other off street parking is sufficient. No traffic shall be
generated by such home occupation in greater volumes than would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood.
(E) The use shall not produce any light, noise, odor, parking demand, traffic or any exterior activity which is inconsistent with the character of the
residential area.
(F) There shall be no exterior (unenclosed) storage on the premises of equipment or materials used in connection with a home occupation.
(G) Home occupations shall not conflict with existing covenants.
(H) The following uses shall not be permitted as home occupations:
Auto body repair or painting of any kind.
Barbershops or hair stylists/salons.
Carpentry work.
Contractors offices, unless no construction activity or storage of equipment/materials occurs at the residence.
Dance instruction.
Dental or medical offices.
Major or minor auto repair.
Private schools with organized classes.
Taxidermy.
Upholstering.
Any other uses that do not conform to the provisions of this chapter.
The zoning coordinator shall approve home occupations and waive the public hearing requirement if the proposed use satisfies the approval criteria
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=567 235/283
and does not involve potential public health or safety or nuisance considerations. Applicants shall be required to participate in a public hearing
whenever residential impacts involving public health or safety or nuisance considerations are anticipated. (Ord. 1710, 4-3-2006)
11-7-5: APPLICATION; PUBLIC HEARING; NOTICE:
(A) Applications for home occupations, including all required supportive information, shall be filed with the Lewistown board of adjustment. Applications,
which require a public hearing, shall be accompanied with the appropriate filing fee as outlined in the most recent city commission resolution. (Ord.
1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989; amd. Ord. 1664, 1-3-2000)
(B) Upon receipt of a home occupation application, the zoning coordinator shall determine if a public hearing is required and, if warranted, shall give notice
of the public hearing to be held before the Lewistown board of adjustment. The notice shall be published at least once in the official newspaper of the
city not more than forty five (45) days nor less than fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled public hearing.
(C) The notice shall further specify the date, time and place for the public hearing. It shall specify the name and address of the applicant, the name and
address of the owner of record of the property, a legal description of the property affected, the street address or its location by approximate distances
from the nearest major street or road intersection so that the property can be easily identified, and a brief statement of the nature of the hearing.
(D) The notice of public hearing may also be made available to all newspapers, radio and television stations serving the jurisdiction for use as a public
service announcement.
(E) The notice shall be sent by mail not more than forty five (45) days nor less than five (5) working days prior to the public hearing to the applicant and
owners of record (or their authorized representative) of the subject property as well as to the owners of record of all parcels within three hundred feet
(300') of the perimeter of the subject property.
(F) If a required property owner fails to receive mail notification of a scheduled public hearing through no fault of the city, this shall in no way invalidate the
legal notice requirements of the scheduled public hearing.
(G) Notice may also be provided to property owners in any additional area that may be substantially impacted by the proposed use as determined by the
zoning coordinator. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-7-6: BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT; REVIEW OF APPLICATION AT HEARING:
(A) The board of adjustment, through the zoning coordinator, shall make an investigation of facts bearing on the application as well as provide necessary
information to assure that the action on each application is consistent with the intent and purpose of this chapter and other city regulations.
(B) The board of adjustment shall consider the home occupation request on the date set for the public hearing or on the date to which such hearing may
be continued from time to time by the board of adjustment in order to obtain a complete record as it deems appropriate. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-
1989)
11-7-7: BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT; WRITTEN DETERMINATION ON PERMIT ISSUANCE; EFFECT:
(A) At the public hearing, the board of adjustment may approve, conditionally approve or deny the home occupation permit if after considering the facts
presented on the application and through public testimony it finds that the criteria as contained in section 11-7-4 of this chapter will be met or will not be
satisfied. The board of adjustment may attach such conditions as it deems necessary and desirable to protect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
(B) In approving, conditionally approving or denying a home occupation permit, the Lewistown board of adjustment shall make a written finding which shall
specify the facts relied upon by the board in making its decision and in establishing conditions.
(C) The home occupation permit, when approved by the board of adjustment, shall be verified, signed and issued by the zoning coordinator. A copy of
each permit shall be provided to the city clerk. The applicant, upon receiving the permit, may then obtain a city business license through the office of
the city clerk. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-7-8: COMPLIANCE; REAPPLICATION; REVOCATION OF PERMIT:
(A) All applicants for a home occupation permit shall sign said application, attesting that all approval criteria outlined in section 11-7-4 of this chapter have
been read, understood and that such shall be complied with in the conduct of the occupation.
(B) Reapplication shall be required whenever the grantee relocates to another residence or circumstances change that warrant reconsideration of the
applicant's compliance with the approval criteria.
(C) Business licenses shall be renewed annually for home occupations. These licenses shall not be renewed unless the home occupation meets the
approval criteria. If after thirty (30) days no action towards compliance has been initiated, the home occupation permit shall be rendered void.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=567 236/283
(D) Approval of a home occupation permit granted on the basis of false information shall be held invalid. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-7-9: CANCELLATION BY PERMIT HOLDER:
Cancellation of a home occupation permit may be effected by the owner/lessor of the property relocating to another legal address, not complying with the
approval criteria, or notifying the zoning coordinator in writing that the home occupation will be discontinued. The permit becomes void upon vacating the
home, compliance with approval criteria has not been initiated within thirty (30) days, or whenever the zoning coordinator receives written notification.
Subsequently, the board of adjustment and the city clerk will be notified that the permit is void. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
Chapter 8
OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING
11-8-1: INTENT:
The intent of this chapter is to reduce traffic congestion and the need for parking on public streets and hazards caused thereby, to provide off street
parking and off street loading berths adequate for each type of development in terms of both quantity and location, and to promote landscape development
in and adjacent to parking areas. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-8-2: DEFINITIONS:
For purposes of this chapter, certain words and phrases are defined and shall be construed as herein set forth in this section.
FLOOR AREA: The gross floor area of a building except the following:
(A) Window display areas.
(B) Storage areas.
(C) Areas used for incidental repair of equipment used or sold on the premises.
(D) Areas occupied by toilets and restrooms.
(E) Areas occupied by public utility facilities.
(F) Areas occupied by dressing, fitting or alteration rooms incidental to the sale of clothing.
(G) Areas occupied by stairways and elevator shafts.
(H) Corridors connecting rooms or suites of rooms.
At the election of the owner thereof, "floor area" shall mean eighty five percent (85%) of the gross floor area of the building (without deduction of
exceptions (A) through (H) of this definition). Such election shall be made in writing to the building inspector, signed and acknowledged by the owner, and
filed with the building inspector prior to the issuance of a building permit for such building.
GROSS FLOOR AREA: Refers to the sum of the gross horizontal areas of the several floors of the building (including floors below as well as above
ground) confined within the interior faces of the exterior walls of the building. A party wall between buildings shall be deemed an exterior wall of each of the
buildings of which it is a part.
NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES: The greatest number of employees who are or may be on the premises during any one average working shift or period of
time of the day or night, as determined by the building inspector.
PARKING LOT: Refers to a structure or an area other than a public street or alley in addition to such ways of ingress and egress, and maneuvering areas
designed or used for the temporary parking of motor vehicles serving a use permitted in the district in which such parcel is situated and available for public
use whether free, for compensation or as an accommodation for customers or clients.
PARKING SPACE, OFF STREET: An area, other than a public street, alleyway or other public property (and exclusive of off street loading spaces)
permanently reserved or set aside for the parking of one automobile or other motor vehicle under one and one-half (11/2) ton capacity as set forth in this
chapter. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-8-3: PARKING SPACE REQUIREMENTS GENERALLY:
No building shall be constructed or relocated within the Lewistown political jurisdiction unless there is provided and thereafter maintained for such building
and its use a minimum number of off street parking spaces as specified in this chapter. Because it may be difficult to satisfy off street parking in the C-2
district, applicants shall approximate requirements as space permits; compliance shall be determined by the building inspector. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff.
6-15-1989)
11-8-4: BUILDING OR USE ENLARGEMENT, CONVERSION OR CHANGE:
No building or structure shall be enlarged, altered, converted or changed in use unless there is provided and thereafter maintained for such building and its
use a minimum number of parking spaces as required. If the number of parking spaces required for such enlargement, alteration, conversion or change in
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=567 237/283
use is less than fifteen percent (15%) of the parking spaces required for the entire building or facility, no parking spaces will be required. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-
1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-8-5: COMBINED OCCUPANCIES:

In the case of a use not specifically mentioned in this chapter, the requirements for the most nearly similar use which is mentioned shall apply. The
decision of the building inspector as to what the most nearly similar use is shall apply. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-8-7: NO REDUCTION IN NUMBER OF SPACES:
Off street parking spaces existing and actually being used for the parking of motor vehicles in connection with the use of an existing building shall not be
reduced in number or size during the entire life of such building or land use below that which would be required for a new building or use of a similar type.
(Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-8-8: FRACTIONAL SPACES:
If the number of off street parking spaces required contains a fraction, such number shall be changed to the nearest whole number. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989,
eff. 6-15-1989)
11-8-9: JOINT USE OF SPACES; CONDITIONS:
The building inspector may authorize the joint use of off street parking facilities within four hundred feet (400') of the use to be served for the following uses
or activities under the conditions specified:
(A) The required off street parking for primarily nighttime uses such as theaters, bowling alleys, bars or supper clubs may be supplied by the parking
requirements for primarily daytime uses such as banks, offices, retail and personal service establishments.
(B) Subsection (A) of this section may be reversed so that parking for nighttime uses may be used for daytime uses.
(C) Parking facilities required by this chapter for churches or auditoriums may be supplied by other parking facilities.
(D) Where joint use is desired, a letter of intent shall be made to the building inspector. It shall contain proof that there will be no substantial conflict in the
principal operating hours of the two (2) buildings or uses for which the use is proposed, that all other conditions within this section are met, and the
agreement shall be signed by both landowners. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)

served by such parking. Such parking lot shall be maintained as a parking lot so long as the building use served is in operation or until another suitable
parking area is established for such building use.
(D) Required parking space shall be located so as to preclude backing maneuvers onto any public right of way with the exception of single- and two-family
dwellings, as defined, in this title. Required parking spaces shall not be located in any required front or side yard, except for single- and two-family
dwellings and manufactured homes. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD)
11-11-1: INTENT:
The purpose of the planned unit development (PUD) is to promote maximum flexibility and innovation in development design and land utilization through
the relaxation of zoning and subdivision regulations; to encourage developers to use a more creative approach in land development; to provide a means
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=567 251/283
for the economical and efficient supply of street improvements and public utilities required in residential development; to conserve natural features; and to
facilitate the provision of more desirable, aesthetic and efficient use of open space. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-11-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions apply:
COMMON OPEN SPACE: A parcel or parcels of land, or an area of water, or a combination of land and water within a planned unit development
designated and intended for the use or enjoyment of residents of the development. Common open spaces may contain complementary structures and
improvements necessary and appropriate for the benefit and enjoyment of occupants of the development.
HOMES ASSOCIATION: Refers to an incorporated, nonprofit organization operating under recorded land agreements through which: a) each lot owner in
the planned unit development is automatically a member, b) each lot is automatically subject to a charge for a proportionate share of the expenses for the
organization's activities and c) common open space and facilities are maintained.
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD): Indicates a land development project consisting of residential and/or commercial, which comprises a blend of
land uses built in a prearranged relationship to each other and which provides for the development of usable and desirable open space, central sewer and
water facilities, and community facilities while providing for the preservation of significant historical and natural features of the land. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989,
eff. 6-15-1989)
11-11-3: PERMITTED USES DESIGNATED:
The following uses are permitted:
Commercial development in a residential PUD shall be subject to the following criteria:
(A) The residential development within the PUD shall constitute the primary market for the commercial uses within the PUD. Not more than fifty percent
(50%) of the market required to support the commercial uses proposed shall be located outside the PUD; however, in cases where a market analysis
clearly demonstrates that existing and planned commercial uses are inadequate to serve the needs of residents of the surrounding area, more than
fifty percent (50%) of the market justifying such commercial uses may be allowed outside the area surrounding the PUD. In all cases, burden of
support for such commercial development is that of the developer.
(B) Adequate buffers and/or landscaping and a specific proposal for signing controls shall be provided in the preliminary site plan to assure that the
basic residential character of the living environment is retained. The design, materials, lighting and scale of all signs shall be subdued,

FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS
11-12-1: ADOPTION:
This chapter adopts the set of comprehensive land use regulations attached as appendix A to the ordinance codified herein for the identified 100-year
floodplains within the city of Lewistown. Identification of the 100-year floodplain is based on the flood insurance study and the accompanying digital flood
insurance rate maps for the city of Lewistown, Montana, dated February 22, 2010. All other ordinances are hereby repealed to the extent of any
inconsistencies. (Ord. 1729, 6-21-2010, eff. 7-22-2010)
11-12-2: PURPOSE:
The purpose of these regulations is to promote the public health, safety and general well being; to minimize flood losses in areas subject to flood hazards;
and to promote wise use of the floodplain. These regulations have been established with the following purposes intended:
(A) To guide development of the 100-year floodplain areas of the city consistent with the enumerated findings by:
1. Recognizing the right and need of watercourses to periodically carry more than the normal flow of water.
2. Participating in coordinating efforts of federal, state and local management activities for 100-year floodplains.
3. Ensuring the regulations and minimum standards adopted, insofar as possible, balance the greatest public good with the least private injury.
(B) Specifically it is the purpose of these regulations to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood or cause increased flood heights or velocities.
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial
construction.
3. Utilize information which identifies lands which are unsuited for certain development purposes because of flood hazards.
4. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
5. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is within a 100-year floodplain and subject to the provisions of these regulations.
6. Ensure that those who occupy 100-year floodplain assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=567 258/283
(B) If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred.
For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first construction to any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of the building commences. A substantial improvement differs from the alteration of a structure in that it is not defined to include
increasing or affecting the external dimensions of the structure. The term also does not include:
(A) Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
(B) Any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of historic places or state inventory of historic places.
SUITABLE FILL: Fill material which is stable, compacted, well graded, pervious, generally unaffected by water and frost, devoid of trash or similar foreign

prohibited by these regulations.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or
other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3 (6)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)
(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided (44 CFR).
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum where specified), of floods
of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989; amd. Ord. 1664, 1-3-2000; Ord.
1729, 6-21-2010, eff. 7-22-2010)

floodplain district. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989)
11-12-5: FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT ESTABLISHMENT:
The floodplain districts established are defined by the base flood elevations and 100-year floodplains as delineated in the flood insurance study. The basis
for the flood insurance study is a scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study For Fergus County, Montana", dated February 22,
2010, with accompanying digital flood insurance rate maps. The official floodplain maps, together with the flood insurance study are on file in the office of
the floodplain administrator. (Ord. 1729, 6-21-2010, eff. 7-22-2010)
11-12-6: FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR:
The city floodplain administrator has been designated to be the city-county planning director, or such other person as designated by the city manager, with
approval of the city commission. The responsibilities of this position are outlined in section 11-12-14 of this chapter. (Ord. 1576, 5-1-1989, eff. 6-15-1989;
amd. Ord. 1663, 1-3-2000; Ord. 1664, 1-3-2000)
11-12-7: INTERPRETING FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT BOUNDARIES:
The boundaries of the 100-year floodplain and floodway shall be determined by scaling distances on the official floodplain maps. Where there appears to
be a conflict between a mapped floodplain boundary and actual field conditions, the city floodplain administrator may determine that the area is not to be
included within the 100-year floodplain. Consequently, the property owner or developer would not have to satisfy the provisions of these regulations. (Ord.

which are not applicable to other lands in the same district.
2. That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this title would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other tract(s) in the same district.

and is the minimum variance that would alleviate the hardship.
4. That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this title and with the Lewistown comprehensive plan.
In granting any variance, the board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this title. Violation of such conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this title.
The board shall prescribe a time limit for commencing and/or completing an action for which a variance is requested. Failure to begin and/or

4. Criteria For Granting Permits:
(a) Permits will not be granted for structures that will exceed the height limitations of areas set forth in these regulations or for uses which are not in
accordance with these regulations, unless a variance has been granted pursuant to the procedure in subsection (E) of this section.
(b) Any permit may require the owner of the structure in question to allow the county commissioners, city commission or airport board, as per
jurisdiction, at the owner's expense, to install, operate and maintain the lights and markers necessary to warn pilots of the presence of that
structure9.
(c) Permits will not be granted for structures or trees that result in obstructions to AAA surfaces, or to allow a change in a nonconforming use despite
its existence on the date the AAA was designated and these regulations were adopted10.
(E) Variances:
1. When Necessary: A person who seeks to erect or increase the height of a structure, or permit the growth of a tree in excess of the height limitations
in these regulations, or use property in a manner that is not a permitted or conditional use, must seek a variance from these regulations.
2. Circumstances For Granting A Variance:
(a) Two Considerations11:
(1) Substantial Practical Difficulty Or Unnecessary Hardship: If a literal application or enforcement of these regulations would result in substantial
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, a variance must be granted, subject to the public interest evaluation below.
(2) Public Interest: A variance is not contrary to the public interest when it is determined, after review by the airport board or appeals board and
after consultation with the FAA, that there is no immediate hazard to air navigation or to persons and property in the vicinity of the airport and
when the noise or vibrations from normal and anticipated normal airport operations would not be likely to cause damage to structures. Public
interest considerations include hours of operation and the annoyance to the intended users of the structures12.
(b) Conditions For A Variance: Conditions may be imposed for granting the variance, including, but not limited to, a requirement the owner of a
structure or tree pay for the installation, operation and maintenance of lights and markers necessary to warn pilots of the presence of an AAA
obstruction. The county, city or airport, as the case may be, may install the lights or markers13.
3. Notice To Applicant: Granting of a variance puts the person who builds a structure pursuant to that variance or buys property for which a variance
has been granted on notice the airport existed before the variance was granted and that noise, fumes, vibrations, light, or any other effects from
normal and anticipated normal airport operations may occur.
4. AAA Variance:
(a) Procedure To Request An AAA Variance:
(1) Obtain an application for a variance from the administrative officer and an FAA form 7460-1.
(2) Submit to the administrative officer the required fee, the completed application, a drawing with enough detail to determine the overall height of
the structure or tree above ground level and a vicinity sketch which shows the location of the structure or tree within the AAA, in relation to
property or section lines. In addition explain in detail why literal application or enforcement of these regulations would result in substantial
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship. The application must address, to the best of the applicant's ability, why granting the variance will not
create an immediate hazard to persons or property in the vicinity of the airport as well as assurance that the normal and anticipated normal
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=567 277/283
airport operations will not be likely to cause damage to any proposed structure(s). The form 7460-1 must be filled out, a copy provided to the
administrative officer, and submitted to the FAA.
(3) The requested variance must be addressed by the airport board prior to the administrative officer making a decision about whether or not to
grant the variance. The approving authority shall notify the adjacent landowner(s) of the request by mail at least ten (10) days before the airport
board meeting and this notice must include the date, time and place of the meeting. The discussion of the requested variance with the airport
board must be specifically set forth as an agenda item in the notice for the meeting of the airport board. Public comment about the variance must
be allowed at the meeting of the airport board.
(4) After consulting with the airport board and taking into consideration any public comment and the FAA determination (form 7460), the
administrative officer shall either grant, grant with conditions or deny the requested variance in writing, explaining the decision14.
(5) The decision of the administrative officer may be appealed to the pertinent appeals board pursuant to these regulations and section 67-7-
303(2), Montana Code Annotated.
(b) Criteria For Granting An AAA Variance:
(1) The requested variance will not be scheduled for discussion by the airport board until the FAA has made a determination, pursuant to form
7460-1, whether or not there is a hazard to air navigation.
(2) A variance must be granted when the applicant demonstrates a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in substantial
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, when the variance would not be contrary to the public interest15 and when the noise or vibrations
from normal and anticipated normal airport operations would not be likely to cause damage to the proposed structure(s)16. Whether or not the
FAA determines there is a hazard to air navigation, FAA recommended mitigation must be a condition of granting the variance.
(3) If noise will affect the use sought by variance, a public interest criterion is the extent to which the applicant proposes to mitigate the effect of
that noise.
(F) Appeals:
1. An appeal to a decision by the administrative officer must be submitted, in writing, to the appeals board within thirty (30) days of the written decision
by the administrative officer. Appeals may be filed by the applicant, by any aggrieved person or taxpayer or by the governing body of a political
subdivision and must state, with specificity, the basis of the appeal. An unsuccessful appellant may appeal further to a court of record.
2. This appeal process does not apply to a determination by the FAA that a requested obstruction would create a hazard to air navigation.
(G) Enforcement: The administrative officer is the agent designated by the county commission, city commission and airport board to enforce these
regulations. Written notice of a violation must be given by the administrative officer to the violator, specifying how these regulations have been violated,
how the violation can be remedied and setting a reasonable deadline for the correction of the violation, prior to the imposition of a penalty. The penalty
provisions of these regulations must also be included in the notice.
(H) Penalty: If a person who violates the provisions of these regulations does not correct a violation, after notification pursuant to subsection (G) of this
section that person is subject to a civil penalty and a criminal penalty. The civil penalty is a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each day that the
violation is not remedied after the county commission or the city commission, as per jurisdiction, has determined there is a violation for which a fine
should be assessed against the violator, has given its own written notice of the violation to the violator, has held a hearing on the violation and has
provided a written determination to the violator that there is a violation.
In addition, the county attorney or the city attorney, as per jurisdiction, may file misdemeanor criminal charges for a violation of these regulations.

11-16-4: AIRPORT AFFECTED AREA (AAA):
(A) Introduction: Utilizing their police power both the Fergus County commission and the Lewistown city commission designated an airport affected area
(AAA) for the Lewistown Municipal Airport in accordance with section 67-7-201, Montana Code Annotated. The AAA includes the land surrounding the
runways and the space or surfaces above that land.
1. Intent: This airport affected area is intended to overlay any other zoning districts and regulations comprising or pertaining to areas to which it is
applicable, so as to prevent undue negative interaction between aviation activities associated with the Lewistown Municipal Airport and the
surrounding community. The area identifies the property in the vicinity of the existence of the airport, associated noise, and activities. This area is
intended to preserve the utility of the airport and the public investment therein.
2. Airport Affected Area (AAA): In order to effectuate the intent of provisions of these regulations, there is hereby created and established the airport
affected area. This area is defined as shown on the airport affected area drawings.

3. Height Restrictions: Height restrictions for areas and land use restrictions in specified areas found in these regulations are meant to be reasonable
and are designed to promote the health, safety and general welfare of airport users and persons and property in the vicinity of the airport, taking into
consideration the character of the flying operations conducted or expected to be conducted at the airport, the nature of the terrain, future
development of the airport, and FAA recommendations for aeronautical surfaces necessary for safe flying operations18. In addition, these regulations
protect the airport and its operations from uses that may infringe on airport operations and result in liability to the airport.
(B) Surfaces Of The AAA:
1. Explanation Of Surfaces: Surfaces are established by these regulations to reasonably regulate the height of structures and trees around the airport.
The term "surfaces" as used in these regulations and as shown on the AAA drawings refers to those surfaces on the ground and above the ground in
which the height of structures and trees is regulated to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. The surfaces for the Lewistown
Municipal Airport are described below and approximately shown on drawings 2, 3, and 4.
(a) Horizontal Surface: A horizontal surface is hereby established as the area within a perimeter established by swinging arcs from points two
hundred feet (200') beyond the planned ends of the runways on the extended runway centerline, then connecting the adjacent arcs by lines
tangent to those arcs. When an arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two (2) adjacent arcs, the arc encompassed must be disregarded in
delineating the perimeter of the horizontal surface. The radius of each arc is:
(1) For utility nonprecision instrument runways, five thousand feet (5,000').
(2) For precision instrument and nonprecision instrument runways, ten thousand feet (10,000'). The horizontal zone does not include the primary,
approach, and transition zones.
(b) Conical Surface: A conical surface is hereby established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal surface and extends
outward a distance of four thousand feet (4,000'). The conical surface does not include the approach and transition surfaces.
(c) Precision Instrument Approach Surface: A precision instrument approach surface is established at each end of the precision runway. Each
precision instrument approach surface shall have a width of one thousand feet (1,000') at a distance of two hundred feet (200') beyond each end of
the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand feet (16,000') at a distance of fifty thousand two hundred feet (50,200')
beyond each end of the runway, with its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. The airport's runway 8 will be protected
for a precision approach for a threshold located one thousand four hundred feet (1,400') to the west of the threshold in existence as of the effective
date of these regulations. Runway 26 will be protected for a precision approach for the existing threshold location.
(d) Nonprecision Instrument Approach Surface: A nonprecision instrument (NPI) approach surface is established at each end of nonprecision
instrument (NPI) runways. Runway 3-21 is a nonprecision instrument runway. Each NPI approach zone shall have a width of five hundred feet
(500') at a distance of two hundred feet (200') beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of three thousand five
hundred feet (3,500') at a distance of ten thousand two hundred feet (10,200') beyond each end of the runway with its centerline being the
continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(e) Utility Nonprecision Instrument Approach Surface: A utility nonprecision instrument (NPI) approach surface is established at each end of utility
nonprecision instrument runways. Runway 13-31 is a utility nonprecision instrument runway. Each utility NPI approach zone shall have a width of
five hundred feet (500') at a distance of two hundred feet (200') beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of two
thousand feet (2,000') at a distance of five thousand two hundred feet (5,200') beyond each end of the runway with its centerline being the
continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(f) Transition Surfaces: Transition surfaces are hereby established adjacent to each approach surface and symmetrically located on each side of
primary surfaces having variable widths as shown on drawing 2 of the AAA adjacent to precision approach surfaces and exterior of the conical
surface, extend a distance of five thousand feet (5,000') measured at right angles to the runway centerline, beginning from the edge of the
approach surface.
(C) Areas Of The AAA: Areas are designated in the AAA to address the concern the FAA and the airport have about compatible uses of land around the
airport. Where protection of planned runway extensions and/or improved approaches is anticipated within a thirty (30) year planning period, affected
areas within the airport property boundaries are designated "airport runway protection area", while remaining areas outside the airport property are
designated "runway influence area". The various areas are defined and described as follows:
1. Explanation Of Areas Within The AAA: These regulations describe both surfaces and areas, which overlap. If there is a conflict between allowable
heights and allowable uses, the more stringent interpretation applies.
(a) Airport Property Area: This area, as shown on drawing 5, encompasses that land owned jointly by Fergus County and the city of Lewistown,
operated by the Lewistown Municipal Airport board and designated for airport use. The airport is required to comply with FAA regulations and grant
assurances within its own boundaries to remain eligible for federal funding assistance, including maximizing the use of nonaeronautical areas in
order to provide revenue to the airport19.
(b) Primary Areas: Primary areas are hereby established as the area extending equidistantly on either side of each runway centerline with total width:
(1) For utility nonprecision instrument runways, five hundred feet (500').
(2) For precision and nonprecision instrument runways, one thousand feet (1,000').
(3) For the length of such runway plus two hundred feet (200') on each end.
(c) Runway Protection Areas And Runway Influence Area: Airport runway protection and influence areas are hereby established as trapezoidal areas
centered about the extended runway centerline. Part of the areas lie within the airport property and part lie outside the airport property. Where both
an existing and future threshold is planned for a runway, the runway protection area will consist of the area enclosed by the trapezoid for the future
planned threshold.
(1) Runway 8-26 Protection Area: Both ends of runway 8-26 protection area shall have a width of one thousand feet (1,000') at a distance of two
hundred feet (200') beyond the runway threshold, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of one thousand five hundred ten feet (1,510') at a
distance of one thousand nine hundred feet (1,900') beyond the runway threshold, with its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of
the runway.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=567 279/283
(2) Runway 13-31 And Runway 3-21 Protection Area: A nonprecision instrument runway protection area is established at each end of these
nonprecision runways. Each runway protection area shall have a width of five hundred feet (500') at a distance of two hundred feet (200')
beyond the runway threshold, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of seven hundred feet (700') at a distance of one thousand two hundred
feet (1,200') beyond the runway threshold, with its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(3) Defined Areas:
A. Runway Protection Area: Property of the trapezoid defined in subsection (C)1(c) of this section that lies within the airport property boundary.
B. Runway Influence Area: Property of the trapezoid defined in subsection (C)1(c) of this section that lies outside the airport property boundary.
(d) Airport Critical Area: The area enclosed by the lines shown on drawing 6 (established as a contour line 50 feet above the airport elevation). This
is an area critical to safe aircraft approaches and departures and will be protected as such.
(e) Remainder AAA Area: The remainder of the AAA area is that which lies outside the airport property area, runway protection area, runway
influence area and airport critical area but which lies within the outer limits of the airport affected area.
(D) Height Restrictions For Surfaces And Areas: Restricting the height of structures so as to protect the airport protects the health, safety and welfare of
the users of the airport as well as persons and property in the vicinity of the airport20. These areas and the regulations are intended to preserve the
utility of the airport and the public investment therein. When a surface or area overlap and one or the other is covered by more restrictive height
limitation, the more restrictive shall prevail. In order to comply with federal requirements and those found in section 67-7-203(1), Montana Code
Annotated, the Lewistown Municipal Airport hereby adopts the following height restrictions for the following areas:
1. Areas:
(a) Primary area:
(1) Objects greater than three inches (3") above grade shall be allowed only when constructed on low impact resistant supports with the frangible
point no higher than three inches (3") above grade.
(2) Objects that need to be located in this area because of their function shall be constructed at the lowest practical height.
(b) Airport property area:
(1) No objects greater than fifty feet (50') above the ground and/or four thousand two hundred seventeen feet (4,217') MSL. In addition, no
structures will be allowed within the building restriction line (BRL) shown on the airport layout plan.
(c) Airport critical area:
(1) No objects shall be permitted to penetrate the approach surfaces, be higher than fifty feet (50') above the ground and/or four thousand two
hundred seventeen feet (4,217') MSL.
(d) Runway influence area:
(1) No objects shall be permitted to penetrate the approach surfaces, be higher than fifty feet (50') above the ground and/or four thousand two
hundred seventeen feet (4,217') MSL.
(e) Runway protection area:
(1) No objects shall be permitted to penetrate the approach surfaces, be higher than fifty feet (50') above the ground and/or four thousand two
hundred seventeen feet (4,217') MSL.
(f) Remainder AAA area:
(1) Any structure or object proposed to be constructed that is greater than one hundred feet (100') AGL shall require a permit application for review
by the governing jurisdictional body.
2. Surfaces: No structure or object shall be permitted to penetrate the following defined surfaces:
(a) Horizontal surface: One hundred fifty feet (150') above the airport elevation. The airport elevation is four thousand one hundred sixty seven feet
(4,167') (MSL), therefore the height restriction limit is four thousand three hundred seventeen feet (4,317') (MSL).
(b) Conical surface: One hundred fifty feet (150') above the airport elevation plus one foot (1') in height for each twenty feet (20') of horizontal
distance measured from and normal to the periphery of the horizontal zone.
(c) Precision instrument approach surfaces: For each runway end, the elevation of the threshold centerline plus one foot (1') in height for each fifty
feet (50') measured perpendicularly from the end of the primary zone, extending ten thousand feet (10,000'); thence one foot (1') in height for each
forty feet (40') for an additional forty thousand feet (40,000').
(d) Nonprecision instrument approach surface: For each runway end, the elevation of the threshold centerline plus one foot (1') in height for each
thirty four feet (34') measured perpendicularly from the end of the primary zone, extending ten thousand feet (10,000').
(e) Utility nonprecision instrument approach surface: For each runway end, the elevation of the threshold centerline plus one foot (1') in height for
each twenty feet (20') measured perpendicularly from the end of the primary zone, extending five thousand feet (5,000').
(f) Transition surfaces: Begin at an elevation equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline, and extend outward and upward at
right angles to the runway centerline or extended runway centerline, increasing one foot (1') in height for each seven feet (7') from the sides of the
primary zone and from the sides of all approach zones.
(E) Land Use In Areas21: The term "area(s)" as used in these regulations and as shown on sheets which are part of the AAA maps or drawings are set
forth in subsections (B) and (C) of this section. Regulation of land uses in these areas around the airport serves to protect the health and safety of
those on the ground and in the air. Well established accident data indicate land uses that concentrate people close to aircraft approach and departure
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=567 280/283
paths should be avoided. Land use regulations protect persons and property in the vicinity of the airport from airport related effects such as high
probability accident areas, noise, fumes, vibrations, light or any other effects from normal and anticipated normal airport operations22.
Permitted uses are those uses which are allowed, and obtaining a permit for these uses pursuant to these regulations serves as notification to the
administrative officer of those uses.
Conditional uses are those uses which may be allowed provided a permit is obtained pursuant to the procedures set forth in these regulations.
Conditional uses will be reviewed to a greater extent than permitted uses and may be limited in duration in the runway influence area. Conditional uses
outside the runway influence area but within the airport critical area will be allowed as long as they do not adversely affect aviation and/or public safety
as determined by the airport board following the guidelines and intent of these regulations. These conditional uses will not supersede any jurisdictional
zoning in place at the adoption of these regulations.
All other uses are prohibited, including sources of electromagnetic effects that may interfere with electronic navigational aids, and lights other than
navigational aids that glare upward or shine on or in the direction of the airport and bird attractants such as solid waste disposal sites, lagoons and
certain types of agriculture23. Under extraordinary circumstances some uses which are not permitted or listed as conditional uses may be allowed,
provided a variance is obtained pursuant to these regulations.
When the following areas overlap, the more restrictive uses apply:
1. Use Restrictions:

navigational aids.
2. Additional Restrictions: Notwithstanding any other provision of these regulations, no use may be made of land within any area established by these
regulations that creates an electromagnetic effect, makes it difficult for operators of aircraft to distinguish between airport lights and others, results in
glare in the eyes of operators of aircraft using the airport, impairs visibility in the vicinity of the airport, attracts flocks of birds or otherwise endangers
the landing, taking off, maneuvering, or operating of aircraft. (Ord. 1739, 2-6-2012)
11-16-5: NONCONFORMING USES24:
(A) Grandfather Clause: It is not the purpose or intent of these regulations to require removal or alteration of any existing structure or tree or to require the
cessation or alteration of a use that is lawfully in existence when these regulations become effective. However, it is assumed nonconforming uses will
not continue forever25. The following provisions are designed to reasonably address nonconforming uses or structures or trees.
1. Documentation Of Uses And Structures Or Trees Within The Airport Boundary And Critical Area: The administrative officer shall document, to the
best of the officer's ability and within a reasonable time after adoption of these regulations, those existing uses of land and the existence of structures
or trees found in the AAA within the airport boundary and critical area with an estimate of the height of structures or trees26.
(a) Nonconforming Uses Of Land: Any lawful use of land in existence when these regulations become effective may continue, but reconstruction of a
structure which contains a nonconforming use after destruction or substantial damage which affects that use may be prohibited. Any addition to or
remodel of a structure containing a nonconforming use requires a variance under these regulations.
(b) Nonconforming Structures Or Trees: Existing structures or trees may continue to exist but their expansion or additional growth is prohibited
unless a variance is obtained under the provisions of these regulations.
2. Substantial Damage To A Nonconforming Use: "Substantial damage" occurs when eighty percent (80%) or more of a structure or tree is deteriorated
or decayed or when that structure or tree has been torn down or destroyed27. The administrative officer has the authority to determine substantial
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=567 282/283
damage. A substantially damaged structure or tree, which is nonconforming, may not be reconstructed or replaced without first obtaining variance
under the provisions of these regulations and then obtaining a permit.
3. Maintaining Nonconforming Trees: After identification of trees in place at the time these regulations become effective, the county or city, as the case
may be, may trim those trees, at its expense, to maintain their heights at the time of identification28.
4. Marking Nonconforming Trees Or Structures: If the county or city, as per jurisdiction, elects to install, operate and maintain, at its own expense, lights
and markers necessary to warn pilots of a nonconforming use, the owners of those structures or trees shall allow this activity29.
5. Residential Land Uses: If land in an area in which residential use is not permitted by these regulations has been developed for that use or platted for
that use, the residential use may continue, but existing owners must be notified by the administrative officer that the lots are within an adopted AAA
within a reasonable time after its designation30. It is the responsibility of those owners to notify subsequent purchasers of the property that the
property is in an AAA and may be affected by these regulations. (Ord. 1739, 2-6-2012)
11-16-6: AMENDMENT OF REGULATIONS:
These regulations may be amended by following the same procedure for adoption as set forth in subsection 11-16-1(D) of this chapter and section 67-7-
201(5), Montana Code Annotated. If appropriate, other boards or commissions may be involved31. (Ord. 1739, 2-6-2012)
11-16-7: ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS:
(A) Acquisition Of Property Rights: Either Fergus County or the city of Lewistown may protect the Lewistown Municipal Airport by utilizing statutory rights
set forth in section 67-7-210, Montana Code Annotated.
(B) Relationship Of AAA Regulations To Zoning Ordinances: If a governing body has adopted a zoning ordinance or resolution and there is a conflict
between these regulations and the zoning ordinance or resolution, the more stringent limitation or requirement prevails32. (Ord. 1739, 2-6-2012)
