PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Durham, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLES CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Code Attorney, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. D. Ann Gray, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code that will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

The said supervisor of elections shall thereupon deliver to the elector making such affidavit copies of petition blanks for demanding such a removal, printed forms of which the supervisor of elections shall keep on hand. Such blanks shall be issued by the supervisor of elections with his or her signature thereto attached and shall be dated and addressed to the Board of Elections of Durham County, indicate the person to whom issued, and state the name of the officer whose removal is sought. A copy of the petition shall be promptly delivered to the city clerk who shall enter the copy of the petition in a record book kept for that purpose in the office of the clerk. A recall petition to be effective must be returned and filed with the supervisor of elections within 30 days after the filing of the affidavit, and to be sufficient must bear the signature of registered voters of the city equal in number to 25 percent of the registered voters of the city as shown by the registration records of the last preceding general municipal election. 
(a1)  It shall be the duty of the Board of Elections of Durham County to investigate the sufficiency of any such petition and to certify the results of such investigation to the city council. The board of elections may employ such persons as it deems necessary to undertake such investigation and the reasonable cost of such investigation shall be reimbursed to the board of elections by the city. The board of elections may adopt such rules and regulations as it deems necessary or advisable concerning the validation of signatures appearing on the recall petition, and such rules and regulations shall be available for public inspection consistent with G.S. ch. 132. 
(b)  If a recall petition shall be certified by the board of elections to be sufficient, the board shall at once submit it to the council with its certificate to that effect and shall notify the officer whose removal is sought of such action. If the officer whose removal is sought does not resign within 5 days after such notice the council shall thereupon order and fix a day for holding a recall election. Any such election shall be held not less than 50 nor more than 70 days after the petition has been certified to the council, and it may be held at the same time as any other general or special election within such period; but if no other election is to be held within such period the council shall call a special recall election to be held within the time aforesaid, provided however, if the provisions of general law prohibit the holding of special elections during the time aforesaid, and no general or special election is otherwise scheduled during said period of time, then the council shall call said special recall election for some date within ten days after the last day of said period of time during which special elections are prohibited by general law.

? For the recall of (name of officer).

RECALL ELECTION 
City of Durham 
_______ (month and day of month) ___ 20___. 
For the recall of ___ 
Against the recall of___ 
(e)  If a majority of the votes cast on the question of recalling an officer be against his recall he shall continue in office for the remainder of the unexpired term, but subject to the recall as before. If a majority of such votes be for the recall of the officer designated on the ballot he shall, regardless of any defects in the recall petition, be deemed removed from office. 
(f)  If an officer in regard to whom a sufficient recall petition is submitted to the board of elections shall resign before the election, or be removed as a result thereof, the vacancy so caused shall be filled in the manner provided by this charter for filling vacancies in such office, except as provided in section 15(3)(h). But an officer removed by the voters as the result of a recall election, or resigning after a sufficient petition for his recall has been submitted to the board of elections shall not be reelected to fill the vacancy caused by his own removal or resignation. 
(g)  No recall petition shall be filed against an officer within 3 months after he takes office, nor, in case of an officer subjected to a recall election and not removed thereby, until at least 6 months after that election. 
(h)  If the recall of a majority of the members of the city council, including the mayor as one of the members, shall be effected at a single recall election, the successors of the officers recalled shall be elected by the registered, qualified voters of the city at a special municipal election, and said successors shall serve for the unexpired part of the terms of the officers recalled. The members of the city council who have not been recalled are empowered to call said special election and to make all necessary provisions regarding the same in conformity to the constitution and general laws of North Carolina. If the recall of all of the members of the city council, including the mayor, shall be effected at a single recall election, they shall be continued in office for the purpose, and only for the purpose, of calling a special municipal election for the election of their successors as above provided, and of ascertaining and declaring the result thereof.

(6)  Any petition to the city council for the making of the local improvements authorized by this section may embrace any one or more of the classes of local improvements named in subsection (4), and may embrace improvements to be made on or in more than one street; provided, any improvement to be made on or in more than one street shall be practically uniform in cost and kind throughout the improvement. 
(7)  The petition for any one or more of such local improvements shall designate by a general description the improvement or improvements proposed, and shall request that the same be made in conformity with the provisions of this section and that such proportion of the cost of each of such improvements as may be specified in the petition be specially assessed against the property abutting on the street or streets or part thereof in which or on which such improvements are proposed to be made.

Whenever any such improvement is ordered made by authority of this subsection, the ordering of the paving of any street or part thereof may include the necessary water main and sewer improvements and the necessary water and sewer laterals, and it may, but need not, include the construction of sidewalks on one or both sides of the street. 
(9)  Upon the finding by the city council that the petition for a local improvement or improvements is sufficient, or when it is proposed to make without petition any improvement or improvements authorized to be made without petition by subsection (8) of this section, the council shall adopt a resolution which shall contain substantially the following:

    At least ten days prior to the date fixed for the hearing, the city council shall cause a notice to be published at least one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. The notice shall contain the information described in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this subsection (9). 
(10)  At the time for the public hearing, or at some subsequent time to which such hearing shall be adjourned, the city council shall consider such objections to the legality of the making of the improvement or improvements as have been made in compliance with paragraph (e) of the preceding subsection, together with such objections as may be made to the policy or expediency of the making of the improvement or improvements; and the council shall thereafter determine whether it will order the making of the improvement or improvements. Any objection against the legality of the making of the improvement or improvements not made in writing, signed in person or by attorney, and filed with the clerk of the city at or before the time or adjourned time of such hearing shall be considered as waived; and if any such objection shall be made and shall not be sustained by the council, the adoption of the resolution ordering the making of the improvement or improvements, as provided in the next following subsection, shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented, unless within ten days after the adoption of such resolution proper steps shall be taken in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief. 
(11)  After such public hearing, if the city council determines to make the improvement or improvements proposed, the council shall adopt a resolution which shall contain: 
(a)  If the improvement or improvements are to be made by virtue of a petition, a finding by the council as to the sufficiency of the petition. (The finding of the council as to the sufficiency of the petition shall be final and conclusive.) If the improvement or improvements are to be made without petition by virtue of the authority contained in subsection (8) of this section, a finding by the council of such facts as are required by the subsection in order to authorize the council to order the improvement or improvements made without petition; 
(b)  A general description of the improvement or improvements to be made and the designation of the street or streets or parts thereof where the work is to be done; 
(c)  If the improvement directed to be made is the paving of a street or part thereof wherein a street railway or railroad company has tracks, a direction that the company pave that part of the street occupied by its tracks, such part to include the space between the tracks, the rails of the tracks, and 18 inches in width outside such tracks, with such material and in such manner as the council may prescribe, and that unless such paving shall be completed on or before a day specified in the resolution, the council will cause the same to be done; provided, however, that where any such company shall occupy such street or streets under a franchise or contract which otherwise provides, such franchise or contract shall not be affected by this section, except in so far as may be consistent with the provisions of such franchise or contract; 
(d)  If the improvement directed to be made includes the construction of water mains or sewers, and in order to provide such mains or sewers in the street or streets to be improved it is necessary to extend the same beyond the limits of such street or streets, the resolution shall contain a provision for the necessary extension of such mains or sewers and a further provision that the cost of such extension shall eventually be assessed against the lots or parcels of land abutting on the street or streets in which such extensions are made but that such assessment shall not be made until such time as the council shall thereafter determine; 
(e)  If the improvement directed to be made is the paving of a street or part thereof, or the construction of sidewalks, the resolution may, but need not, contain a direction that the owner of each lot abutting on the part of the street to be improved, connect his lot by means of laterals with water mains, gas or sewer pipes, or any one or more thereof, located in the street adjacent to his premises in accordance with the requirements of the city governing the laying of such laterals, and that unless such owners cause such laterals to be laid on or before a date specified in the resolution, such date to be not less than 30 days after the date of the resolution, the council will cause the same to be laid; 
(f)  A designation of the proportion of the cost of the improvement or improvements to be assessed against abutting property, and of the number of equal annual installments in which assessments may be paid. The resolution after its passage shall be published at least once in some newspaper published in the city, or, if there be no such newspaper, the resolution shall be posted in 3 public places in the city for at least 5 days; 
(g)  In lieu of publishing the resolution in the manner prescribed by paragraph (f) of this subsection (11), the city council may publish, or cause to be published, a notice containing the information specified in paragraph (b) and the first sentence of paragraph (f) of this subsection. If the city council, in its discretion, chooses to publish the notice prescribed by this paragraph in lieu of publishing the resolution prescribed in said subparagraph (f) then such notice shall be published at least once in some newspaper published in the city, or, if there be no such newspaper, the notice shall be posted in 3 public places in the city for at least 5 days. Two or more notices may be consolidated into a single notice. 
(12)  The city council shall have power to determine the character and type of construction and of material to be used and to determine any other details of plan or construction necessary to be determined in making any of the improvements authorized by this section and to determine whether any work to be done by the city shall be done by contract or by forces of the city. The council shall have power also subject to the provisions of subsection (11), paragraph (e) of this section to determine the number of water, sewer and gas laterals that shall be laid to any lot on any street to be improved. If the work or any part thereof is to be done by contract, the city may let all of the work in one contract, or it may divide the same into several contracts, and may let the contracts separately. In any case where part of a street is required to be paved by a street railway or railroad company as provided in the next preceding subsection, the city may, in the discretion of the council, contract with the street railway or railroad company for the paving, or work incidental thereto, or both, and the cost of the paving or work incidental thereto, or both, as fixed by the contract shall constitute a lien on the franchises and other property of such street railway or railroad company. 
(13)  Upon the completion of the improvement or improvements to be made by the resolution, the city council shall ascertain the total cost thereof. In addition to other items of cost, there shall be included in such total cost the cost of all necessary legal services, the amount of damages paid or to be paid for injury to property by reason of any change of grade or drainage, including court costs and other expenses incidental to the determination of such damages, and the cost of retaining walls, sidewalks or fences built or altered in lieu of cash payment for such property damage, including the cost of moving or altering any building. In determining the cost of any street lighting improvement, the council shall ascertain the excess of cost of construction of the system of lighting over and above the cost of construction of such system of lighting as the city provides at public expense for streets of the same kind, and such excess shall be considered the cost thereof. In determining the cost of any of the improvements authorized by this section, the council shall include therein the interest paid on the cost of the improvement during the period of construction. The determination of the council as to the total cost of any improvement shall be conclusive. 
(14)  Having determined such total cost, the City Council shall thereupon make a preliminary assessment as hereinafter set out in this section. Such preliminary assessment shall, however, be advisory only, and shall be subject to the action of the Council thereon as hereinafter set out in subsection 17 of this section. The preliminary assessment shall be made on the basis hereinafter set out in this subsection for the classes of improvements indicated; provided, that if the petition, or the resolution, in those cases where the improvement was ordered made without petition, specified that there should be specially assessed against the benefited property a smaller proportion of the cost of any improvement than is hereinafter specified in this section, then there shall be assessed against the benefiting property only such proportion of the cost of the improvement as was specified in the petition or in the resolution. 
(a)  Street paving. The total cost of any street paving improvement, exclusive of so much of the cost as is incurred at street intersections and the share of street railways or railroads, shall be specially assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting directly on the street paved, according to the extent of their respective frontages thereon, by an equal rate per foot of such frontage. The cost of that part of the paving required to be borne by a street railway or railroad, which paving is done by the city after default by the street railway [or railroad] in making the same as hereinbefore provided in this section, or which is done by the city by contract with the railway or railroad as provided in subsection (12) of this section, shall be assessed against the street railway or railroad, and the assessment shall be a lien on all of the franchises and property of the street railway or railroad company, and may be collected by sale of such property and franchises as is provided in subsection (23) of this section; provided, further, that in case of a corner lot, used as a single lot, the council may provide by ordinance for the city to bear a part of the cost of paving in accordance with the following formula, the amounts or distances therein shown being maximum amounts or distances which may be reduced by the ordinance: 
(i)  In the event that neither of the streets abutting a corner lot, used as a single lot, has ever been paved, such lot shall be exempt from assessment for the paving improvement alongside of such lot to the extent of 20 percent of the first 150 feet thereof or 30 feet, whichever is less. Thereafter, upon the paving of the intersecting street on which such lot abuts, such lot shall be exempt from assessment for the paving of the street to the extent of 50 percent of the frontage on such street or 30 feet, whichever is less. 
(ii)  In the event that the street alongside of a corner lot, used as a single lot, is paved and the intersecting street is to be paved, such lot shall be exempt from assessment for the paving of the intersecting street to the extent of 50 percent of the frontage thereon or 30 feet, whichever is less. 
(iii)  In the event a street in front of a corner lot, used as a single lot, has been paved and the street alongside of such lot is to be paved, the lot shall be exempt from assessment for the paving improvement alongside of such lot to the extent of 40 percent of the frontage on such street or 60 feet, whichever is less. 
    The exemption herein provided shall apply only in areas zoned for residential use or for apartments, and such portion of the cost of construction as would otherwise be assessed against such corner lot shall be borne by the city. 
(b)  Sidewalks. The total cost of constructing or reconstructing sidewalks shall be assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting on that side of the street upon which the improvement is made, according to their respective frontages thereon by an equal rate per foot of such frontage, the lots within a block being deemed to abut upon a sidewalk although the latter extends beyond the lots to the curbline of an intersecting street; provided, further, that in case of a corner lot, used as a single lot, the council may provide by ordinance for the city to bear a part of the cost of sidewalk improvements in accordance with the following formula, the amounts or distances therein shown being maximum amounts or distances which may be reduced by the ordinance: 
(i)  In the event that neither of the streets abutting a corner lot, used as a single lot, has sidewalks, such lot shall be exempt from assessment for the sidewalk improvement alongside of such lot to the extent of 20 percent of the first 150 feet thereof or 30 feet, whichever is less. Thereafter, upon the construction of sidewalks on the intersecting street, on which such lot abuts, such lot shall be exempt from assessment for the sidewalk improvement on the street to the extent of 50 percent of the frontage on such street or 30 feet, whichever is less. 
(ii)  In the event that the street alongside of a corner lot, used as a single lot, has sidewalks and sidewalks are constructed on the intersecting street, such lot shall be exempt from assessment for the sidewalks on the intersecting street to the extent of 50 percent of the frontage thereon or 30 feet, whichever is less. 
(iii)  In the event a street in front of a corner lot, used as a single lot, has sidewalks and sidewalks are to be constructed on the intersecting street, the lot shall be exempt from assessment for the sidewalk improvement alongside of such lot to the extent of 40 percent of the frontage thereon or 60 feet, whichever is less. 
    The exemptions herein provided shall apply only in areas zoned for residential use or for apartments, and such portion of the cost of construction as would otherwise be assessed against such corner lot shall be borne by the City. 
(c)  Water mains and sewers. In the case of water mains and storm and sanitary sewers, the cost of not exceeding an 8 inch water or sanitary sewer main and of not exceeding a 30 inch storm sewer main and of such portion of the mains as lie within the limits of the street or streets, or parts thereof, to be improved as provided in the petition or resolution ordering the same, shall be assessed against the abutting property. Such cost shall be assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting on the street or streets, or parts thereof according to their respective frontages thereon (i.e., the entire frontage benefited by the water or sanitary sewer project) by an equal rate per foot of such frontage; provided, that in case of a corner lot, used as a single lot, no assessment shall be made against the long side of the lot abutting on the intersecting streets for any part of the frontage of such long[er] side of the lot except that portion in excess of 200 feet if the lot is in a residential section of the city, or in excess of 100 feet if the lot is in a business section of the city, and in such case the portion of the cost as would otherwise be assessed against the lot shall be borne by the city; provided further, that if a water or sanitary sewer main in excess of 8 inches in size or a storm sewer main in excess of 30 inches in size is laid in the portion of the street or streets, then the cost of the water or sanitary sewer main in excess of the cost of an 8 inch main and the cost of the storm sewer main in excess of a 30 inch main shall be borne by the city, provided further, that if the resolution ordered the construction of any septic tank or disposal plant, no part of the cost of the same shall be specially assessed; provided further, that if the resolution ordered the construction of any pumping station, force main or sanitary sewer outfall, the costs thereof may be assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting on the street or streets, or parts thereof, according to their respective frontages thereon (i.e., the entire frontage benefitted by such pumping station, force main or sanitary sewer outfall) by an equal rate per front foot of such frontage; provided, however, in the case of a corner lot, used as a single lot, where there is a sewer already laid on the intersecting street on which the lot abuts and by which the lot is or can be served, no assessment shall be made against the lot for the costs of any pumping station, force main or sanitary sewer outfall incident to the second sewer for any part of the frontage of the lot except that portion in excess of 200 feet if the lot is in a residential section, or in excess of 100 feet if the lot is in a business section, and in such case the portion of the cost as would otherwise be assessed against the lot shall be borne by the city. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit the right of the city to contract with any property owner or owners for the construction of any pumping station, outfall, septic tank or disposal plant or for the construction of water mains or storm or sanitary sewers and for the assessment of the cost thereof according to the terms of such contract. 
(d)  Water and sewer laterals. The entire cost of each water and sewer lateral required to be laid by the owner of the property for or in connection with which such lateral is laid, but laid by the city after default by the property owner in making the same as hereinbefore provided, shall be specially charged against the particular lot or parcel of land for or in connection with which it was made. 
(e)  Water mains and sewers and laterals; flat rate assessment. In lieu of assessing each water and sanitary sewer improvement project on the basis of the cost of that particular project, the city council shall have authority to establish flat rates per frontage foot for the assessment of property abutting water and sewer improvement projects, based on the average cost of constructing 8 inch water mains and 8 inch sanitary sewer mains in the city, and shall also have authority to establish flat rates for the assessment of property abutting the installation of water and sanitary sewer laterals, based on the average cost of installing such laterals in the city. The Council may then assess property abutting water and sanitary sewer improvement projects on the basis of the flat rates so established, subject to the right of any nonpetitioning property owner to have the assessment against his property adjusted as provided by law upon a showing that his property has not been benefitted to the extent of the assessment. 
(f)  Grass plots. The entire cost of grading or otherwise improving, or of planting, the grass plots in any street or part thereof, shall be assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting on the street or part thereof wherein or whereon such improvements are made by an equal rate per front foot of such frontage; provided, that this subsection shall be construed to mean that when a grass plot in any street is graded or planted or otherwise improved, the cost thereof shall be assessed against all of the property abutting on the street within the block where such grass plot is located. 
(g)  Lighting improvements. The cost of any lighting improvement, such cost being determined as provided in subsection (13) of this section, shall be specially assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting directly on the street or streets, or part thereof, where such improvement is made, according to their respective frontage thereon by an equal rate per foot of such frontage. 
(h)  Waterfront improvements. The cost of any waterfront improvement shall be specially assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting on the improvement according to their respective frontages thereon by an equal rate per foot of such frontage. 
(i)  In addition to the bases for making assessments for the cost of improvements specified above in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this subdivision, the city council may alternatively, or in conjunction, make assessments on the following bases: 
(1)  The area of land served, or subject to being served, by the improvement, at an equal rate per unit of area. 
(2)  The value added to the land served by the improvement, or subject to being served by it, being the difference between the appraised value of the land without improvements as shown on the tax records of the county, and the appraised value of the land with improvements according to the appraisal standards and rules adopted by the county at its last revaluation, at an equal rate per dollar of value added. 
(3)  The number of lots served, or subject to being served, where the project involves extension of an existing system to a residential or commercial subdivision, at an equal rate per lot. 
(4)  A combination of two or more of these alternative bases, which may also be combined with the specific assessment basis listed above in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this subdivision, for each class of improvement. Whenever the basis selected for assessment is either area or value added, the city council may provide for the laying out of benefit zones according to the distance of benefited property from the improvement being undertaken, and may establish differing rates of assessment to apply uniformly throughout each benefit zone. For each improvement, the city council shall endeavor to establish an assessment method from among the bases set out in this section that will most accurately assess each lot or parcel of land according to the benefit conferred upon it by the improvement. 
(15)  For the purpose of assessment, the city council shall cause to be prepared a preliminary assessment roll, on which shall be entered a brief description of each lot or parcel of land assessed, the amount assessed against each such lot as determined under the provisions of the next preceding subsection, and the name or names of the owner or owners of each such lot, as far as the same can be ascertained; provided, that a general plan map of the improvement or improvements on which is shown the frontage and location of such lot on the street improved, together with the amount assessed against each such lot and the name or names of the owner or owners thereof, as far as the same can be ascertained, shall be a sufficient assessment roll. If the resolution directed the making of more than one improvement, a single preliminary assessment roll for all of the improvements authorized by such resolution shall be sufficient, but the cost of each improvement to each lot affected shall be shown separately. 
    The city council may choose not to levy assessments against property owned by the city, in which case, the amount assessable against city property shall be omitted from the preliminary assessment roll and shall not be assessed against the remaining property owners. The city council shall count city-owned property for the purpose of determining the sufficiency of a petition submitted pursuant to subsection (7) of this section notwithstanding the decision of the city council not to levy an assessment against such property. 
(16)  After such preliminary assessment roll has been completed, the city council shall cause it to be filed in the office of the city clerk for inspection by parties interested, and shall cause to be published one time, in some newspaper published in the city, or if there be no such newspaper the council shall cause to be posted in 3 public places in the city, a notice of the completion of the assessment roll, setting forth a description in general terms of the local improvement or improvements, and stating the time fixed for the meeting of the council for the hearing of objections to the special assessments, such meeting to be not earlier than ten days after the first publication or from the date of posting of such notice. Any number of assessment rolls may be included in one notice. The council shall publish in the notice the amount of each assessment. 
(17)  At the time appointed for that purpose or at some other time to which it may adjourn, the city council shall hear the objections to the preliminary assessment roll of all persons interested, who may appear and offer proof in relation thereto. Then or thereafter, the council shall either annul or sustain or modify in whole or in part the prima facie assessment as indicated on the roll, either by confirming the prima facie assessment against any or all lots or parcels described therein, or by canceling, increasing or reducing the same according to the special benefits which the council decides each of the lots or parcels has received or will receive on account of such improvement, except that assessments against railroads made because of contract or franchise obligations to pay a portion of cost shall be in accordance with such obligations. If any property which may be chargeable under this section shall have been omitted from the preliminary roll or if the prima facie assessment has not been made against it, the council may place on the roll an apportionment to such property. The council may thereupon confirm the roll, but shall not confirm any assessment in excess of the special benefits to the property assessed and the assessments so confirmed shall be in proportion to the special benefits, except as hereinabove provided in the case of franchise obligations of railroads. Whenever the council shall confirm an assessment for a local improvement, the city clerk shall enter on the minutes and on the assessment roll, the date, hour, and minute of such confirmation, and from the time of such confirmation the assessments embraced in the assessment roll shall be a lien on the property against which the same are assessed of the same nature and to the same extent as county and city taxes and superior to all other liens and encumbrances. After the assessment roll is confirmed a copy of the same shall be delivered to the collector of revenue of the city. 
(18)  If the owner of, or any person interested in, any lot or parcel of land against which an assessment is made is dissatisfied with the amount of such assessment, he shall within 15 days after the confirmation of the assessment roll file a written request with the city clerk for reconsideration of said assessment by the city council. If the city council has not previously heard the requesting person on the matter, it shall reconsider the assessment and affirm or modify its action. If it has previously heard the requesting person on the matter, the city council may affirm its previous action without further consideration, or it may, in its discretion, again consider the matter and affirm or modify its previous action. If the requesting person still is dissatisfied with the city council action, he shall within 20 days after such further action serve on the city clerk a written notice that he is taking an appeal to the Superior Court of Durham County and a statement of facts upon which he bases his appeal. The appeal shall be tried in the Superior Court of Durham County as other actions at law. The remedy herein provided for any person dissatisfied with the amount of the assessment against any property of which he is the owner or in which he is interested shall be exclusive. 
(19)  If it shall be made to appear to the city council after confirmation of any assessment roll that any error has been made therein, then the council shall cause to be published one time in some newspaper published in the city, or if there be no such newspaper the council shall cause to be posted at 3 public places in the city, a notice referring to the assessment roll in which such error was made, naming the owner or owners of the lot or parcel of land with respect to which such error was made, if the same can be ascertained, and naming the time and place fixed for the meeting of the council for the correction of the error, such meeting not to be earlier than ten days from the publication or from the date of the posting of the notice. At the time fixed in the notice or at some subsequent time to which the council may adjourn, the council, after giving the owner or owners of the property affected and other persons interested therein an opportunity to be heard, may proceed to correct the error, and the assessment then made shall have the same force and effect as if it had originally been properly made. 
(20)  The city council shall have the power, when in its judgment there is any irregularity, omission, error or lack of jurisdiction in any of the proceedings relating thereto, to set aside the whole of the local assessment made by it, and thereupon to make a reassessment. In such case there shall be included, as a part of the cost of the public improvement involved, all interest paid or accrued on notes or certificates of indebtedness, or bonds issued by the city to pay the expenses of such improvement. The proceeding shall, as far as practicable, be in all respects as in the case of original assessments, and the reassessment shall have the same force as if it had originally been properly made. 
(21)  After the expiration of 20 days from the confirmation of the assessment roll, the collector of revenue, or such other officer of the city as the council may direct so to do, shall cause to be published one time in such newspaper published in the city, or if there be no such newspaper, shall cause to be posted at 3 public places in the city, a notice that any assessment contained in the assessment roll, naming and describing it, may be paid to him at any time before the expiration of 30 days from the date of publication or posting of the notice, without interest from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll, but that if the assessment is not paid in full within this time, all installments thereof shall bear interest at a rate fixed by the city council of not more than 9 percent per annum from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll. 
(22)  The property owner or street railway or railroad hereinbefore mentioned in this section shall have an option and privilege of paying for the improvements hereinbefore provided in cash as provided in the preceding subsection or in not less than 12 equal monthly installments nor more than ten equal annual installments as may have been determined by the original resolution ordering the improvement or improvements. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the payment of assessments in advance of the maturity or installment schedule affixed by the city council. If paid in installments, such installments shall bear interest at a rate fixed by the city council of not more than 9 percent per annum from the date of the confirmation of the assessment roll. If any assessment is not paid in cash, the first installment thereof with interest thereon shall become due and payable 30 days after the publication or posting of the notice required by the preceding subsection and one subsequent installment and interest thereon shall be due and payable on the same day of the same month in each successive year until the assessment is paid in full; provided, however, that if the council shall so direct, such installments shall become due and payable on the same date when property taxes of the city are due and payable. If any installment with interest thereon is not paid when due, it shall be subject to the same penalties as are now prescribed by law for unpaid taxes, in addition to the interest herein provided for. The whole assessment may be paid at any time by the payment of the full amount due with accrued interest. 
(22.1)  (a)  Notwithstanding subsection (22) of this section, the city council may allow payment of assessments over an extended period of time, not to exceed 20 years, and at a reduced interest rate where the property owner demonstrates special financial hardship. In case of an assessment for water or sewer improvements, the special payment provisions shall apply until the earlier of (i) when the owner makes application for connection to receive water or sewer service; or (ii) such time as a fee interest in the property is transferred or conveyed, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, and whether during the lifetime of the owner or by devise or descent. In case of an assessment for street paving, sidewalks, or other improvements, the special payment provisions shall apply until such time as a fee interest in the property is transferred or conveyed, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, and whether during the lifetime of the owner or by devise or descent. At the time of application for connection or the time of transfer or conveyance, as applicable, the unpaid balance of the assessment shall become immediately due and payable in full. For purposes of this subsection, a lease, mortgage, or deed of trust shall not be considered as a transfer or conveyance of a fee interest in the property. In no event may the due date of the unpaid balance of the assessment extend beyond the lifetime of the owner. 
(b)  As a prerequisite to exercising the authority granted by this subsection, the city council shall define what constitutes a special financial hardship, and may amend this definition from time to time. 
(c)  The authority granted by this subsection shall be exercised only upon written application of the owner of property subject to the assessment. The application must be filed with the city clerk no later than 15 days after confirmation of the assessment roll. The application shall be on a form approved by the city council. The application shall contain such information and documentation pertaining to special financial hardship, and such other information, as the city council may require. 
(d)  The city council may delegate authority to the city manager or designee of the city manager to approve or deny any application submitted pursuant to this section. If any such application shall be approved by the city, the city clerk shall mark upon the confirmed assessment roll such words as shall indicate such approval by the city, the special payment provisions and the date and time of the approval. 
(23)  In case of the failure of any property owner or street railway or railroad company to pay any installment when the same shall become due and payable, then and in that event all of the installments remaining unpaid shall immediately become due and payable, and the property and franchises may be sold by the city under the same rules, regulations, rights of redemption and savings as are now prescribed by law for the sale of land for unpaid taxes. Collection of such assessments with interest and penalties, may also be made by the city by proceeding to foreclose the lien of assessments as a lien for mortgages is or may be foreclosed under the laws of the state, and it shall be lawful to join in any bill for foreclosure any one or more lots or parcels of land, by whomsoever owned, if assessed for an improvement ordered by the same resolution. After default in the payment of any installment, the payment of the installment, together with interest and penalties due thereon, before the lot or parcel of land, against which the same is a lien, is sold or the lien is foreclosed as hereinbefore provided, shall bar the right of the city to sell the land or to foreclose the lien thereon by reason of the default. 
(24)  If the resolution ordering the making of any improvement or improvements included a provision for any necessary extension of a water or sewer or sewers, as provided in subsection (11), paragraph (d) of this section, at such time after the completion of the extension or extensions as, in the judgment of the city council, circumstances justify the assessment of the cost thereof, the council shall cause a preliminary assessment to be made as provided in subsection (14), paragraph (c) of this section, and the procedure thereafter to be followed with respect to such assessment and the force and effect thereof shall be as already prescribed in this section. 
(25)  After any lighting improvement is made as provided in this section, the city is hereby authorized, as long as the lighting system shall be maintained, to make an annual assessment against the lands assessed with the original cost of the improvement sufficient to cover the excess of actual cost of maintenance and operation of the lighting system over and above the cost of maintenance and operation of such system of lighting as the city provides at public expense for streets of the same character as that whereon the lighting improvement is made. To that end, the city council shall cause to be prepared a preliminary assessment which shall, as far as practicable, conform to the requirements of subsection (14), paragraph (g) of this section; and the procedure thereafter to be followed with respect to such assessment and the force and effect thereof shall be as already prescribed in this section. 
(26)  When any special assessment has been made against any property for any improvement authorized by this section, and it is desirable that the assessment be apportioned among subdivisions of the property, the city council shall have authority, upon petition of the owner of the property, to apportion the assessment fairly among the subdivisions. Thereafter, each of the subdivisions shall be relieved of any part of such original assessment except the part thereof apportioned to the subdivision and the part of the original assessment apportioned to any such subdivision shall be of the same force and effect as the original assessment. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to limit authority granted elsewhere in this charter or by general or special law to apportion assessments among subdivisions of property without requiring a petition from or the consent of the owners of such property. 
(27)  No change of ownership of any property or interest therein after the passage of a resolution ordering the making of any improvement authorized by this section shall in any manner affect subsequent proceedings, and such improvement may be completed and assessments made therefor as if there had been no change in such ownership. 
(28)  No lands in the city shall be exempt from special assessments as provided in this section except lands belonging to the United States; and the city council and the officers, trustees or boards of all incorporated or unincorporated bodies in whom is vested the right to hold and dispose of real property shall have the right by authority duly given to sign the petition for any local improvement authorized by this section; provided, however, that assessments against land owned by the State of North Carolina are controlled by the provisions of G.S. 160A-221; provided further that, except as provided by this section, assessments against railroads are controlled by the provisions of G.S. 160A-222. 
(29)  All proceedings for special assessment under the provisions of this section shall be regarded as proceedings in rem, and no mistake or omission as to the name of any owner or person interested in any lot or parcel of land affected thereby shall be regarded a substantial mistake or omission. 
(Acts 1975, ch. 671, § 77; Laws 1977, Ch. 632, § 1; Laws 1981, Ch. 694, § 3; Laws 1983, Ch. 458, § 3; Laws 1985, Ch. 641, § 1; Laws 1987, Ch. 753, § 1; Laws 1991, Ch. 577, §§ 1, 2; Laws 1991, Ch. 992, § 3; Laws 1995, Ch. 755, § 1; S.L. 2012-94, § 1) 
Sec. 78. - Assessments for local improvements without petition. 
(1)  Supplemental to and independent of the powers and authority heretofore or hereafter granted the city by the general assembly, the city council is authorized and empowered without the necessity of having filed by the owners of abutting property, to construct and install or contract for the construction and installation of paving, repaving, macadamizing, and remacadamizing of any of the public streets, sidewalks and alleys, and the construction, reconstruction and altering of curbs, gutters and drains in any of the public streets and alleys, and the construction and installation of sanitary sewers, water mains and sanitary sewer and water laterals in any of such public streets and alleys, and specially assess the entire cost of such construction and installation, except the part thereof as is incurred at street intersections, against the property abutting upon the street or alley or streets or alleys which are so improved. 
    The city council is further authorized and empowered without the necessity of having a petition filed with it to open, clear, grade, construct drainage and otherwise improve streets, avenues and alleys which have been dedicated to public use by making and recording in the office of the register of deeds a map or plat designating such streets, avenues or alleys thereon, and to specially assess the entire cost of such opening, clearing, grading, construction of drainage and other improvements to such streets, avenues or alleys against the property abutting upon such streets, avenues or alleys so opened and improved. 
    The city council may specially assess less than the total cost against the abutting property if it should determine by resolution that it would be inequitable to specially assess the entire cost thereof; and in determining whether it would be inequitable, the city council is authorized to take into consideration the location, width, use and general importance of such street or alley as it relates to the public welfare, safety, health, and convenience. 
(2)  When it is proposed to make without petition any improvement or improvements described in subsection (1) hereof, the city council shall adopt a resolution which shall contain substantially the following: 
(a)  That this proceeding is taken under and will be governed by the provisions of this charter (stating the number of the chapter and section); 
(b)  A statement of the reasons proposed for the making thereof; 
(c)  A brief description of the proposed improvement or improvements; 
(d)  The proportion of the cost of the improvement or improvements to be specially assessed and the terms of payment; 
(e)  A notice of the time and place when and where a public hearing will be held on the proposed improvement or improvements. The time fixed for the public hearing shall be such as to allow of notice being given thereof not less than ten days prior thereto; 
(f)  A notice that all objections to the legality of the making of the proposed improvement or improvements shall be made in writing, signed in person or by attorney, and filed with the city clerk at or before the time of such hearing, and that any such objections not so made will be waived. 
    At least ten days prior to the date fixed for the hearing, the city council shall cause a notice to be published at least one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. The notice shall contain the information described in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this subsection (2). (Laws 1981, Ch. 694, § 4) 
(3)  In the event the city council elects to proceed under this section to make local improvements and specially assess the cost thereof against abutting property without the filing of a petition therefor, as is authorized by this section, and does adopt the resolution provided for in subsection (2), then and in such event, the procedure applicable to such proceedings from that point to the final completion of the improvement, the final confirmation of the assessment roll, and the remedies available, shall be as particularly set forth and provided in subsections (10) [through (29)] of Section 77 of this Charter. 
(4)  When electing to make local improvements and specially assess the cost thereof upon abutting property, without petition therefor, as authorized by this section, the city council shall specially state in the resolution adopted as provided in subsection (2) hereof that it is proceeding under and by virtue of the provisions of this section of the city charter. 
(Acts 1975, ch. 671, § 78) 
Sec. 79. - Apportionment of assessments among lots in subdivisions. 
(1)  In any case where one or more special assessments shall have been made against any property for any local improvement or improvements authorized by general or special law, and the property shall thereafter be subdivided or about to be subdivided and it is, therefore, desirable that the assessment or assessments be apportioned among the subdivision of such property, the city council may, without requiring any petition or consent from the property owners or other persons affected thereby, apportion the assessment or assessments, or the total thereof, fairly among such subdivisions, as same are benefited by the improvement and release such subdivisions, if any, as in the opinion of the city council are not benefited by the improvement. Upon the making of such a reapportionment and reallocation, each of the subdivisions shall be relieved of any part of the original assessment or assessments except the part thereof apportioned to a specific lot, parcel or subdivision, and the part of the original assessment or assessments apportioned to any such lot, parcel or subdivision shall be of the same force and effect as to such lot, parcel or subdivision to the extent of the amount and interest thereon apportioned to the lot, parcel or subdivision as the original assessment or assessments were prior to the making of such reapportionment. The making of such an apportionment by the city council shall be by resolution, which resolution shall set forth the manner and extent of the reapportionment with sufficient clarity to enable the office of the city collector of revenue to correctly and accurately reflect such reapportionment upon the records of the assessment account or accounts in his office. Such reapportionment or reassessment may include past due installments of principal, interest and penalty, if any, as well as assessments not then due, and the remaining installments shall fall due. 
(2)  When it is proposed to make a reapportionment of such assessments as authorized by this section, the city council shall adopt a preliminary resolution which shall contain substantially the following: 
(a)  A brief description or statement of the location of the property affected; 
(b)  The total principal amount of the assessments involved in the proposed reapportionment, together with a brief statement showing the date of confirmation and the kind and character of the assessments; 
(c)  A notice of the time and place when and where a public hearing will be held on the question of making a reapportionment or reassessment of the assessments, and the extent thereof. (The time fixed for the public hearing shall be such as to allow of notice being given thereof not less than 2 weeks prior thereto). 
    The resolution shall be published once a week for 2 successive weeks in some newspaper published in Durham County, the first publication to be at least 2 weeks prior to the public hearing. At the time for the public hearing, or at some subsequent time to which the hearing, shall be adjourned, the city council shall consider all objections which may be made to the making of such reapportionment, and shall thereafter determine whether it will make the reapportionment and the manner and extent to which the reapportionment of assessments will be made. The final decision of the city council shall be in the form of a resolution making the apportionment, which resolution shall set forth all of the facts and pertinent provisions mentioned and required by subsection (1) of this section. 
(Acts 1975, ch. 671, § 79) 
Sec. 80. - Condemnation and assessment authority outside the corporate limits. 
    Supplemental to and independent of any other power and authority possessed by the city, the city council shall have the right and power to acquire rights-of-way, easements, and other property outside its corporate boundaries in the exercise of the power of eminent domain in the same way and under the same authority and procedures as it has the power to acquire such rights-of-way, easements and property inside the corporate boundaries, provided that nothing herein shall be construed to enlarge the power of the city to condemn property already devoted to public use. The city council shall also have the power and authority, in the extension, installation, construction, operation, and maintenance of its water and sewerage facilities outside of its corporate boundaries to create water and/or sewer benefit assessment districts and to specially assess the cost of such water or sewer installations or construction against the property in such benefit assessment districts on the basis of the front foot rule, the benefits derived or to be derived by the property in such assessment districts, or some other equitable method promulgated and established by the city council in the exercise of its sound legislative discretion. 
(Acts 1975, ch. 671, § 80) 
Sec. 81. - Additional assessment authority. 
    In exercising the authority granted under G.S. 160A-311 et seq. to extend and operate public enterprises outside its corporate limits, the city council may specially assess all or part of the costs of constructing, reconstructing, extending, building or improving water supply and distribution systems or sewage collection and disposal systems, or any part thereof, outside the corporate limits of the city against property benefited therefrom. Special assessments levied pursuant to this section shall be levied and collected in the same way and under the same authority and procedures as special assessments levied and collected by the city upon property within the corporate limits. No special assessment shall be levied under the authority of this section until a petition which meets the requirements set forth in Section 77, subsection (7) of this Charter has been submitted to the city by the owners of the property affected; provided, however, no petition is necessary in cases where the city council finds that it is reasonably necessary or expedient to extend such water supply and distribution system, sewage collection and disposal system, or both such systems, to serve, in whole or in part, property in Durham County when the board of commissioners of the County of Durham requests such extension or extensions. 
(Acts 1975, ch. 671, § 81; Laws 1995, Ch. 687, § 1) 
Sec. 82. - Lien affixed for water and sewer service. 
(1)  In addition to any other powers and authority heretofore granted by general law, local act or this charter, the city council is hereby authorized and empowered to provide water service or sewer service or both such services to property, within or without the corporate limits, abutting existing city water or sewer mains or the right-of-way thereof and affix a lien to the property for the cost of providing this service. 
(2)  The authority granted by this section shall be exercised only upon petition by the owner or owners of such abutting property. Such petition shall be upon a form approved by the city council and shall contain: 
(a)  A description of the service or services requested; and 
(b)  A description of the property to be served; and 
(c)  The anticipated cost of furnishing such services; and 
(d)  The term of payment by such property owner for the costs incurred by the city in furnishing such service, including but not limited to, the number of installments in which payment shall be made and the interest rate to be applied to any unpaid balance; and 
(e)  Such other information as may be required by the city council. 
(3)  The city council may approve or deny any such petition submitted. If any such petition shall be approved by the city council, the city clerk shall mark upon the face of such petition such words as shall indicate such approval by the city council, and the date and time of the approval. 
(4)  From and after approval of any petition submitted pursuant to this section, a lien in favor of the city shall exist upon the property described in such petition for the amount stated in such petition as the anticipated cost of furnishing such service. Such lien shall be inferior to all prior and subsequent federal, state and county tax liens of record but superior to all others. This lien may be collected by foreclosure in the same manner as provided by law for the foreclosure of liens for special assessments. Any foreclosure proceeding instituted pursuant to this section shall be deemed a proceeding in rem and no mistake or omission as to the name of any owner or person interested in any lot or parcel of land affected thereby shall be regarded a substantial mistake or omission. No change of ownership shall affect any lien created pursuant to this section. 
(5)  Payment of the anticipated costs of providing service shall be as prescribed by the terms of the petition approved by the city council.

(a)  The City Council is authorized to assess the City's costs for projects that construct, reconstruct, or repair stormwater facilities on private or public property when the projects remediate a flooding or other public nuisance or enable compliance with State or federal requirements regarding water quality. The assessments shall be made against properties the project serves or will serve or against the owner of a failing facility or the property on which the facility is located. The authority granted under this section does not allow the City to enter private property except as otherwise authorized by law or agreement. In the event that work is necessary on an existing facility, unless the project is necessary to remediate a current public nuisance, prior to initiating a project, the City shall give advance written notice to the property owner or owners upon which the facility is located and shall afford the owner or owners a reasonable opportunity to cure any deficiency in the facility. The City Council's assessment authority under this section shall be exercised pursuant to one or more ordinances adopted by the City Council which are consistent with the provisions of this section. 
(b)  The City shall make a professional engineering determination regarding the properties that are or will be served by the project using drainage basins, subdivision plats, site plans, or other professionally recognized indicators. When costs are to be allocated to more than one property, the City shall allocate the costs using any or a combination of the following criteria: (i) the area of individual properties; (ii) tax valuation; (iii) the number of buildable lots or properties; (iv) zoning; (v) one or more professional appraisals; or (vi) impervious area. In addition, the City may take into account contributions and fees a property has already made toward construction or repair of a facility. 
(c)  The City shall prepare an assessment roll showing the cost allocated to each property which shall be filed and available for public review in the office indicated in notices provided pursuant to this subsection. The City Council shall conduct a public hearing regarding the proposed assessment and assessment roll. At least 21 days prior to the public hearing, individual notice by first-class mail shall be sent to each impacted property owner at the address shown on the most current county tax records. The notice shall include a description of the project, the assessment roll, and the time and date of the council meeting at which the public hearing is scheduled. Notice shall also be published not less than 10 days before the public hearing on the City's Web site and in a daily newspaper that serves the City. Published notice shall include a description and location of the project, the total costs to be assessed, the geographic area subject to the assessment, the public office in which the assessment roll showing individual properties and assessment amounts can be found, and an Internet link where the specifics of the assessment roll can be located. The person who has mailed notice and ensured compliance with the published and Internet postings shall file with the City Council a certificate of compliance with the requirements of this subsection and, in the absence of fraud, the certificate shall be conclusive. 
(d)  After the public hearing, the City Council may confirm the assessment as proposed, continue the matter, not approve the proposed assessment, or direct that the assessment process begin anew. All documentation regarding the approved assessment shall be retained in the Office of the City Clerk or the Department of Public Works. 
(e)  The City Council may set aside or reduce a prior assessment made against a property, with individual notice to the affected property owner, if a clerical or factual error has substantially impacted the result of any assessment by more than five percent (5%). For purposes of this subsection, the term "error" includes, but is not limited to, the use of an incorrect tax value, incorrect calculation of buildable lots or area of property, or mistaken identification of a property or lot. In addition, the City Council may set aside the whole of an assessment if there has been a substantial irregularity in the proceedings or process as required under this section. The assessment process shall be considered an in rem proceeding. 
(f)  A final assessment approved by the City Council shall be a lien against the property assessed of the same nature and to the same extent as a lien for county and city taxes, according to the priorities set forth in G.S. 160A-233(c). 
(g)  The provisions of subsections (21), (22), (22.1), (23), (26), (27), and (29) of Section 77 of this Charter shall apply to assessments approved pursuant to the provisions of this section. A request for apportionment of an assessment for property that is subdivided as provided under Section 77(26) of this Charter may be approved administratively by the City Manager and the City Manager's approval, and the resulting assessment amounts for subdivided properties shall be filed with the City Clerk with the originally approved assessment amounts. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (21), (22), (22.1), (23), (26), (27), and (29) of Section 77 of this Charter, the City Council may, in its discretion, by ordinance, accelerate payment of assessments due for land that at the time of assessment was undeveloped so that payment is required prior to issuance of a building permit or a certificate of compliance.

Sec. 97. - Enactment of subdivision controls. 
(1)  For the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals, convenience, economy and general welfare of the city; the well-ordered establishment and growth of a system of public streets, alleys and thoroughfares; the more convenient transportation and access by means of streets, avenues, alleys, and public ways in the city and its environs; the quicker and more effective use of the street system in the fighting of fires and extension of police protection; the prevention of the overcrowding of lands with buildings with resulting increase of density of population within a small area; to require the reasonable separation of buildings from each other for such distances as may be required to lessen the danger of spreading conflagration; to facilitate the proper laying, maintaining and operating of water mains and sewer mains and the installation and maintenance of other public utilities so as to serve the residents and commercial houses and manufacturing plants of the city in a more economical, practical, orderly and efficient manner; and for other general welfare, health and safety purposes, the city council is hereby authorized and fully empowered to regulate the establishment, dedication, location and dimensions of any proposed public street, alley or other public way, and the subdivision, rearrangement or platting of the boundaries of lots or parcels of real property when any such real property is located in whole or in part upon any existing or proposed public street, alley, avenue, boulevard or other public way within the corporate limits of the city or within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city, upon or through or by means of which existing or proposed public streets, alley, avenue, boulevard or other public way the city now provides, or may in the future provide either grading, paving, curbs, gutters, drainage, public sewer or water facilities, street lighting, police and fire protection, or any other municipal service or facility. 
(2)  The city council is authorized and empowered to adopt ordinances setting up and establishing standards and requirements with which all subdivisions and rearrangements of the boundaries of the land and maps and plats thereof thereafter made shall comply; and adopt ordinances setting up and establishing standards and requirements for the location, dedication and dimensions of all proposed streets, alleys and other public ways, and such other matters as affect or will affect the public convenience, safety and general welfare; and adopt ordinances requiring that streets and public ways shall be graded, curbed, guttered [and] paved; drainage, sidewalks, street lights and signs installed, and water, sewer, and other utility mains and connections be installed, or such of the facilities and the extent and manner of such improvements as may be determined from time to time by the council to be in the public interest, and such ordinances may provide that, in lieu of the completion of such work and installations previous to the final approval of a plat or map, the council may authorize the filing of a bond in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it providing for and securing to the city the actual construction and installation of such improvements and utilities within a period specified by the council and expressed in such bond or other approved undertaking, which bond or other undertaking may be enforced by the city by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies and proceedings, all as a condition precedent to the approval of maps and plats of such subdivisions within the area referred to in subsection (1) of this section. In adopting ordinances fixing standards and requirements the council is hereby specifically authorized and empowered to include any or all of the following provisions, namely: Adopt a plan of major thoroughfares and collector streets and require that all new streets or enlarged streets shall conform to the same where such plan is applicable, both as to location and width;

to require dedication of easements in the rear of lots, or in such other parts of such lots as may be more appropriately applicable in any given case, for the location of poles, wires, conduits, storm or sanitary sewers, gas, telephone and water lines, or other public and quasi-public utilities, due consideration of all factors so as to work the least practical hardship or difficulty upon the lots or the owners thereof to be considered in locating the easements upon the lots; to provide for the minimum and maximum length and width of blocks of land between intersecting streets; to provide that the lot side lines shall be radial to the street line; to require that the lines and frontages of buildings on corner lots shall be such as to prevent the rear of the building on a corner lot from protruding beyond the building setback line of the building fronting on a street which constitutes a side of such corner lot;

to require that permanent monuments of stone or concrete of dimensions which may be prescribed be set at all block corners and at all corners in the exterior boundary of any subdivision and that the location thereof be clearly set forth and designated on the final approved plat, and to provide that all lot corners be staked by metal stakes or other approved stakes; to require that street lines deflecting from each other within a block be connected by a curve, the radius of which shall be determined after considering the factors of sign distance, the type and importance of street, anticipated traffic volume, and convenience of traffic movement; to require that the arrangement and location of streets and other ways in new subdivisions shall make provision for continuation of the principal existing streets and other ways in adjoining subdivisions, or their proper projection when adjoining property is not subdivided; to require that a preliminary plat shall be furnished the planning division or other department designated by the council for preliminary checking to determine whether the preliminary plat is in compliance with the ordinances and requirements established by the council; to provide that a final plat be prepared and submitted and contain compliance with all of the provisions of the ordinances and be so marked on its face before the same may be filed for record; to provide that no street shall be accepted or maintained by the city, nor shall any public utility such as water, sewer or street lighting be extended to or connected with any subdivision of land, nor shall any permit be issued by any administrative official or department of the city for the construction of any building or improvement requiring a permit, upon any land concerning which a plat may be required by such ordinance until the requirements of such ordinances have been complied with; and to provide such other details as may be found, in the legislative discretion of the council, to have a substantial relation to the public convenience, health, safety or welfare; to require that such plat or map be finally approved as being in compliance with the ordinances adopted by the council before such map or plat of such subdivision shall be entitled to be filed or recorded in the office of the register of deeds of Durham County and to require that all such approved plats and maps of subdivisions of real estate be recorded or filed in the office of the register of deeds of Durham Count [County] in which such lands are situate; to provide that the violation of the provisions of such ordinances shall subject the person violating the same, including the surveyor, to penalties, upon conviction, not exceeding a fine of $50.00.

(3)  The city council may provide for the appointment of a board to be known as a development review board consisting of 4 or more members who shall serve without pay as such members, each of whom shall be appointed by the council for a term of years or for a term at the will of the council, as may be determined by the council; in the event the council appoints such board for a term of years, the term of office of each member shall be 3 years. The development review board shall hear and decide appeals from and review any order, requirement, decision or determination made by any administrative official charged with the enforcement of any ordinance adopted pursuant to this section. It shall also hear and decide all matters referred to in or upon which it is required to pass under any such ordinance. The affirmative vote of a majority of members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of any administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such ordinance or to effect any variation in any of the provisions of such ordinance. Every decision of such board shall, however, be subject to review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Such appeal may be taken by any person aggrieved or by an officer, department, board or bureau of the city. Such appeal shall be taken within such time as shall be prescribed by the development review board by general rule, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the development review board a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal from the administrative official to the development review board stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from until the decision of the development review board is rendered, at which time the stay of proceedings shall cease, unless the proceedings shall be further stayed by a restraining order granted by a court of record or by the development review board. The development review board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal from the administrative official and shall give due notice thereof to the parties, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. The development review board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, action or determination appealed from, and shall make such order, requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion ought to be made in the premises, and to that end shall have all of the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of such ordinances, the development review board shall have the power, in passing upon appeals, to vary or modify any of the regulations or provisions of such ordinances relating to subdivisions, plats, maps and all other requirements of the ordinance, in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this section, so that the spirit of the ordinance may be observed, public safety, convenience and welfare secured and substantial justice done. 
(4)  In case any person, firm, or corporation shall violate any of the provisions of any ordinance which may be adopted by the city council under the authority of this section, or is about to violate such provision, the city, in addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceedings in its name in the superior court to prevent and restrain such unlawful act or violation or the continuance thereof. 
(5)  This section is enacted in the exercise of the police power of the State of North Carolina, and the power and authority hereby delegated to the city council to adopt ordinances and to require compliance with such ordinances, including the dedication of alleys and easements for utilities as authorized, shall be deemed to be an exercise by the city council of the police powers delegated to it, and shall not be deemed to be an exercise of the power of eminent domain which may be possessed by the city. 
(6)  It is the legislative intent that if any portion, clause or sentence of this section shall be deemed to be invalid or unconstitutional, such declaration of invalidity shall not affect the remaining portions of this section, which would have been passed notwithstanding the invalidity of such portions which may be declared invalid.

The city council shall cause reasonable notice of the intended removal, sale or other disposition of the personal property to be given to the owner of the building or dwelling or to the owner of the personal property if such owner is known and is someone other than the owner of the building or dwelling, and shall afford such owner or owners a reasonable period of time to remove such personal property. Reasonable notice shall be deemed to have been given if posted in a conspicuous location on the building or dwelling at least 7 days prior to removal of said personal property by the city. The provisions of Section 86 of this charter, which authorize the sale of property at private sale, may, but need not, be followed in the sale of such personal property. The proceeds of such sale shall be applied to the costs of the sale and to the costs of vacating and closing, or demolishing such building or dwelling.

Sec. 101. - Board of building appeals. 
(1)  The city council shall have power to provide for the creation and organization of a board of building appeals to which appeals may be taken from the decision of the building inspector upon any provision of the building code of the city. Such board shall consist of 5 members, each to be appointed for a term of 3 years, except the first members appointed by authority hereof, one of whom shall be appointed for 1 year, 2 for 2 years and 2 for 3 years. Such board shall have power to elect its own officers, to fix the time and places for its meetings, to adopt necessary rules of procedure and to adopt all other rules and regulations not inconsistent herewith which may be necessary for the proper discharge of its duties; and it shall keep an accurate record of its proceedings. An appeal from any decision or order of the building inspector to such board shall be taken within such reasonable time as shall be prescribed by the board by general rule and shall be taken by filing with the building inspector and with the clerk or secretary of the board, or with such other person as may be designated by the board, a notice of appeal which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of any such notice of appeal, the building inspector shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When any such appeal is from a decision of the building inspector refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, such decision of the building inspector shall remain in force until modified or reversed by the board as hereinafter provided. When any such appeal is from a decision of the building inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, such appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirements of the building inspector until the hearing thereon by the board unless the building inspector certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which certificate shall be furnished the appellant), a suspension of his requirement would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case such requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown and upon not less than one day's written notice to the building inspector, by the board or by any judge of the superior court authorized by law to grant restraining orders. The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals and shall decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing of any appeal any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The board of building appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from, and may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of the building inspector; provided, that the concurring vote of 4 members of the board shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision of the building inspector. In passing upon appeals, the board shall have power not only to determine whether the decision of the building inspector is made upon a proper construction of the pertinent provisions of the building code, but it shall have power also to allow materials and methods of construction other than those required by the building code to be used when in its opinion such other materials and methods of construction are as good as those required by the code; and for this purpose the requirements of the building code as to such matters shall be considered simply as a standard to which construction shall conform. The board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the building code, to adopt the application of the code to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the code shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. Every decision of the board shall be subject to review by the superior court of Durham County.

If paid in installments, such installments shall bear interest at a rate fixed by the city council of not more than 9 percent per annum from the date when the city approves payment of the facilities fee in installments.

Foreclosure may begun at any time following 30 days after the due date. The city shall not be entitled to a deficiency judgment in an action to foreclose a facilities fee lien. 
(e)  The city may not maintain an action or proceeding to enforce any remedy for the foreclosure of a facilities fee lien unless the action or proceeding is begun within the period of time prescribed by law for the foreclosure of special assessment liens.

(5)  Sit as arbitrators in binding arbitration pursuant to the Uniform Arbitration Act, embodied in Article 45A of Chapter 1 of the North Carolina General Statutes (G.S. 1-567.1 et seq.); provided, that the time within which a part may apply to the General Court of Justice to vacate, modify or correct an award may be limited to 60 days. 
(b)  Judicial review of committee orders. Judicial review of committee orders other than arbitration awards shall be in accordance with Article 4 of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes (G.S. 150B-43 et seq.) provided, however, that the provisions of G.S. 150B-45 notwithstanding, petitions for judicial review shall be filed in the Superior Court of Durham County; provided, further, the provisions of G.S 150B-51(b) notwithstanding, the trial court judge may grant to the petitioner, or to any other party, such temporary relief, restraining order, or other order as the court determines is just and proper and the trial court judge may affirm, modify, or set aside, in whole or in part, the committee's order, or remand the order for further proceedings and enforce the order to the extent that the order is affirmed or modified. The term "agency," whenever used in Article 4 of the Chapter 150B of the North Carolina General Statutes (G.S. 150B-43 et seq.), shall mean the committee(s) as authorized or created by the city council of the City of Durham under the authority of this act. 
(c)  Enforcement of committee orders: 
(1)  Decisions of a committee sitting as arbitrators shall be enforced as provided in Article 45A of Chapter 1 of the General Statutes (G.S. 1-567.1 et seq.). Otherwise, if, within 60 days after entry of an order of the committee, a respondent has neither complied with nor sought review of such order, any aggrieved person or the committee may apply to the Superior Court of Durham County for an order of the court enforcing the order of the committee. 
(2)  Within 30 days after the court's receipt of the petition for enforcement of the agency's order, or within such additional time as the court may allow, the committee shall transmit to the court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceedings leading to the order. With the permission of the court, the record may be shortened and testimony submitted by tape recording, by stipulation of all parties. Any party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for such additional cost as may be occasioned by the refusal. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record when deemed desirable. 
(3)  The hearing on the petition for enforcement of the committee's order shall be conducted by the court without a jury. The court shall hear oral arguments and receive written briefs, but shall take no evidence not offered at the committee's hearing; except that in cases of alleged irregularities in proceedings before the committee not shown in the record, testimony thereon may be taken by the court; and except that where no record was made of the proceedings or the record is inadequate, the judge in his discretion, may hear all or part of the matter de novo; provided, that if the order imposed includes punitive damages, then as to that portion of the order, the respondent shall have a right to a trial de novo on that issue. 
(4)  The court shall issue the order requiring compliance with the committee's order, unless it finds that enforcement of the committee's order would prejudice substantial rights of the party against whom the order is sought to be enforced, because the committee's findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are: 
a.  In violation of constitutional provisions; or 
b.  In excess of the statutory authority of jurisdiction of the committee; or 
c.  Made upon unlawful procedure; or 
d.  Affected by other error of law; or 
e.  Unsupported by substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted; or 
f.  Arbitrary or capricious. 
(5)  If the court declines to enforce the committee's order for one of the reasons specified in paragraph (4) of this section, it shall either: 
a.  Dismiss the petition; or 
b.  Modify the committee's order and enforce it as modified; or 
c.  Remand the case to the committee for further proceedings. 
(6)  Any party to the hearing on the petition for enforcement of the committee's order may appeal the court's decision to the appellate division under the rules of procedure applicable to other civil cases. 
(Laws 1983, Ch. 373, § 1; Laws 1993, Ch. 658, § 1.2) 
Sec. 124. - [Further recourse of complainant.] 
(a)  Civil action for unlawful housing practice. An ordinance adopted pursuant to this act may permit any complainant to bring a civil action in the Superior Court Division of the General Court of Justice of Durham County against the person allegedly engaging in the unlawful practice. Such civil action for a housing practice shall be brought no later than one year after an alleged discriminatory housing practice has occurred or terminated. 
(b)  Injunctions; equitable relief. If the court finds that the respondent has engaged in or is engaging in an unlawful housing practice charged in the complaint, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful housing practice, award special damages, actual damages, and punitive damages. 
(Laws 1983, Ch. 373, § 1; Laws 1993, Ch. 658, § 1.3) 
Sec. 125. - [Award of attorney's fees.] 
    An ordinance adopted pursuant to this act may provide for an award of attorney's fees to the prevailing party in any action or proceedings under such ordinance, other than the committee, in the discretion of the committee or court. 
(Laws 1983, Ch. 373, § 1) 
Sec. 126. - Complainants and other records. 
    The city council may provide that neither complaints filed with any committee pursuant to the ordinance nor the discovery, or attempts at conciliation, in whatever form prepared and preserved, shall be subject to inspection, examination, or copying under the provisions of what is now G.S. ch. 132. 
(Laws 1983, Ch. 373, § 1) 
Sec. 127. - Committee meetings. 
    The provisions relating to meetings of governmental bodies, as set forth in Article 33C of Chapter 143 of the General Statutes (G.S. 143-318.9 et seq.), shall apply to the activities of any committee authorized to enforce the ordinance. Provided, however, that the city council may provide that said statutory provisions shall not apply to the activity of a committee to the extent that the committee is: 
(1)  Receiving a complaint; or 
(2)  Conducting an investigation, discovery or conciliation pertaining to a complaint filed pursuant to the ordinance.

Chapter 1 - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 1-1. - How Code designated and cited. 
    The provisions of this and the following chapters shall constitute and be designated the "Code of Ordinances, City of Durham, North Carolina," which may also be cited as the "Durham City Code," "City Code," "Code of the City of Durham," or phrase of like nature. 
(Code 1982, § 1-1) 
State Law reference- Codification required, G.S. 160A-77; admission into evidence of Code, G.S. 160A-79. 
Sec. 1-2. - Definitions and rules of construction. 
    In the construction of this Code and of all ordinances and resolutions, the following definitions and rules of construction shall be observed, unless inconsistent with the manifest intent of the council or the context clearly requires otherwise. This section is subject to section 1-10. 
    Charter. The term "Charter" means the Charter of the City of Durham, North Carolina. 
    City, municipality. The terms "city" and "municipality" mean the City of Durham, in the State of North Carolina. Where the context admits, it shall mean the city manager. 
    Code. The terms "the Code" and "this Code" mean the Code of Ordinances, City of Durham, North Carolina, as designated in section 1-1. 
    Computation of time. The time within which an act is to be done shall be computed by excluding the day of the act, event, default or publication after which the designated period of time begins to run and including the last day; unless the last day is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than seven days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation. A half holiday shall be considered as other days and not as a legal holiday. 
    Conjunctions. Conjunctions, such as "and" and "or," shall each be deemed to include the other as the context shall admit. 
    Council, governing body. The terms "council," "city council," and "governing body" mean the city council of the City of Durham. 
    County. The term "county" means the County of Durham, in the State of North Carolina. Where the pertinent location is not in the County of Durham, the applicable county is intended. 
    Day, business day, working day. The term "day" means a calendar day. The terms "business day" and "working day" are equivalent to each other and exclude weekends and legal holidays. This definition is subject to the definition of "computation of time" above. 
    Examples. The principle that the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another will not alone generally be sufficient to override the presumption that the provisions of this chapter are to be used to construe all ordinances. For instance, if an ordinance twice uses the word "includes," and at one of those occasions it modifies that use with the phrase "but is not limited to," the presumption will still stand that the definition of "include" in this section 1-2 applies to the other use of "includes" in that ordinance. 
    G.S., General Statutes. The abbreviation "G.S." and the expression "General Statutes," mean the General Statutes of North Carolina. 
    Gender. Words importing one gender include the other genders. 
    Governmental person . The term "governmental person" means government and an agency, subdivision, or unit of government, such as a city, town, county, board of education, sanitary district, airport authority, state, and the federal government. Depending on the context, the term may include the City of Durham. 
    Holiday. A "holiday" is a day observed by city government as a holiday or legal holiday as provided in section 42-16(a), (b). 
    Include. The term "include" and its various forms are used without limitation. 
    Joint authority. All words giving a joint authority to three or more persons or officers shall be construed as giving such authority to a majority of such persons or officers. 
    Law, statute, rule, regulation, code. 
(a)  Where an ordinance or resolution incorporates by reference a law, statute, rule, regulation, standard, or code adopted by any person other than the city council, the law, statute, rule, regulation, standard, or code in effect on the date of adoption by the city council of the ordinance or resolution is incorporated. 
(b)  Where the City Code as adopted in the 2008 recodification incorporates by reference a law, statute, rule, regulation, standard, or code adopted by any person other than the city council, subsection (a) of this definition shall not apply. Instead, the law, statute, rule, regulation, standard, or code in question is incorporated as it was in effect of the date of the adoption of the ordinance adopting the 2008 recodification. 
(c)  References in ordinances and resolutions that are intended to call attention to laws, statutes, rules, regulations, standards, and codes, but which are not intended to incorporate by reference, are not subject to subsections (a) and (b) of this definition. 
    Legal holiday. A "legal holiday" is a day observed by city government as a holiday or legal holiday as provided in section 42-16(a), (b). 
    Manager, city manager. The term "manager" or "city manager" means the city manager of the City of Durham and his or her designee. 
    Month. The term "month" means a calendar month. 
    Number. Words used in the singular include the plural and the plural includes the singular number. 
    Oath. The term "oath" includes an affirmation in all cases in which, by law, an affirmation may be substituted for an oath, and in such cases the terms "swear" and "sworn" are equivalent to the terms "affirm" and "affirmed." 
    Officer. Reference to an officer by title includes any duly authorized deputy or assistant of such officer, or, to the extent allowed by law, the agent of such officer. 
    Officer, department, board, etc. Reference to an officer, department, board or other entity by title refers to the officer, department, board, etc., of the city in contrast with an officer, department, board, etc., of any other entity. 
    Ordinance. The term "ordinance" includes ordinances contained in this Code and ordinances omitted from this Code. 
    Owner. The term "owner," applied to a building or land, includes any part owner, joint owner, tenant in common, joint tenant or tenant by the entirety, of the whole or a part of such building or land. 
    Person: 
(1)  The term "person" includes an individual, corporation, limited liability company, firm, partnership, association, organization, any group acting as a unit, and governmental person. The use of the term "person" in the ordinances and in resolutions, where either is adopted after the date of the adoption of the 2007 recodification of the City Code, is as stated in this subsection (1). 
(2)  The use of the term "person" in ordinances and in resolutions, where either was adopted on or before the date of the adoption of the 2007 recodification of the City Code, shall be construed without consideration of subsection (1) of this definition. 
    Personal property. The term "personal property" includes every species of property except real property. 
    Preceding, following. The terms "preceding" and "following" mean next before and next after, respectively.

    Street. The term "street" includes any public way, road, highway, street, avenue, boulevard, parkway, alley, lane, viaduct, and bridge and the approaches thereto, which has been accepted for maintenance by the state or by the city. 
    Tenant, occupant. The terms "tenant" and "occupant," applied to a building or land, include any person who leases or occupies, respectively, the whole or a part of such building or land, whether alone or with others. 
    Time. Words used in the past, present or future tense each include the other tenses. 
    UDO, Unified Development Ordinance. The term "UDO" means the Unified Development Ordinance. Unless the context indicates otherwise, UDO and Unified Development Ordinance refer to the Unified Development Ordinance of the city, rather than of the county. 
    Weekdays, weekend. "Weekdays" are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. The "weekend" is Saturday and Sunday. 
    Writing. The terms "writing" and "written" includes printing and any other visual mode of representing words and letters. 
    Year. The term "year" means a calendar year in contrast to a fiscal or other year. However, in some contexts the term "year" means the period of time between two dates such that they are one year apart. For instance, "during the two years before January 15, 2006" will generally mean January 15, 2004 through January 14, 2006 instead of January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005.

Sec. 1-3. - Supplementation of Code; ordinances of limited interest or transitory nature; setting fees. 
(a)  By contract or by municipal personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code, and such supplement may also include amendments to the Charter. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _______ to _______" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
(d)  The following ordinances, including ordinances renewing, extending, or amending such ordinances, are not to be codified: 
(1)  Ordinances that set dates, times, or locations of regular city council meetings, including work session meetings, when all of such meetings will occur within 13 months of the adoption of the ordinance. 
(2)  Ordinances that will have no effect after 13 months from the adoption of the ordinance. 
(3)  Ordinances that promise or guarantee the payment of money by or for the city, or authorize the issuance of bonds of the city or evidence of the city's indebtedness. 
(4)  Ordinances that authorize a contract or the assumption of an obligation by the city. 
(5)  Ordinances that make an appropriation. 
(6)  Ordinances that provide for local improvements or that impose assessments therefor. 
(7)  Ordinances that accept a plat or subdivision. 
(8)  Ordinances that change the boundaries of the city. 
(9)  Ordinances that set the rate for ad valorem property taxes. 
(10)  Capital project ordinances and grant project ordinances. 
(11)  Ordinances that name streets. 
(12)  Budget ordinances. 
(e)  The following ordinances, including ordinances renewing, extending, or amending such ordinances, are to be codified as technical ordinances and shall be published separately from this Code: 
(1)  Franchises granted pursuant to section 67 et seq. of the Charter or pursuant to G.S. 160A-76. 
(2)  Ordinances that set tax rates, except for ad valorem property taxes and privilege license taxes. 
(3)  The emergency operations plan adopted pursuant to section 22-21. 
(4)  The Unified Development Ordinance. 
(f)  The following ordinances, including ordinances renewing, extending, or amending such ordinances, shall be codified by entry upon official lists or schedules: 
(1)  Ordinances that set rates for utility or other public enterprise services. 
(2)  Ordinances that set fees to be charged by the city. 
(3)  Ordinances that set fares, rates, and charges that may be charged by passenger vehicles for hire. 
(4)  Except to the extent the city council otherwise provides, and except as provided in other subsections of this section, ordinances that regulate or set any rates, deposits, fees, fares, and charges imposed by any person, including the city, and including credits granted by the city; provided, however, that ordinances setting a charge that is denominated as a "civil penalty" will be in this Code instead of on an official list or schedule. 
(g)  Unless provided otherwise, fees referred to in ordinances will be set by the city council from time to time. 
(h)  The technical ordinances referred to in subsection (e)(2) and the official lists and schedules referred to in subsection (f) are referred to in this subsection as the "fee schedule." From time to time the city manager shall, in consultation with the city attorney, prepare and revise the fee schedule as appropriate to accurately reflect decisions by the city council regarding fees, fares, rates, charges, etc. set by such technical ordinances and official lists and schedules (referred to collectively as "fee schedule charges"). The intent is that the fee schedule is to be kept current to show fee schedule charges in effect when the schedule is revised. In general, repealed fee schedule charges shall be removed from the schedule, but in the city manager's discretion historical information may be provided in the fee schedule if it is labeled or arranged so that readers are not likely to be confused regarding which schedule charges are in effect. Without limiting the foregoing authority, the city manager may make non-substantive changes to decisions by the city council, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them in the fee schedule. For example, the city manager may in consultation with the city attorney: 
(1)  Reorganize the material into appropriate subdivisions, including parts, sections, and chapters, including designating which departments, divisions, offices, etc. are primarily responsible for particular schedule charges. 
(2)  Assign and change captions. 
(3)  Assign and change numbers of subdivisions.

(Code 1982, § 1-7) 
Sec. 1-8. - Severability of parts of ordinances. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the council that the phrases, clauses, sentences, provisions, paragraphs, and sections of ordinances are presumed to be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, provision, paragraph, or section of any ordinance shall be declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, provisions, paragraphs, and sections of the ordinance, because it shall be presumed that they would have been enacted without the incorporation of such unconstitutional or invalid phrase, clause, sentence, provision, paragraph, or section. This section does not apply to article IV or article VIII of chapter 70. This presumption may be rebutted, without limitation, by a different severability provision that is made applicable to an ordinance. 
(Code 1982, § 1-8) 
Sec. 1-9. - General penalties; misdemeanor penalty; civil penalties for parking violations; vehicle operation violations; continuing violations; alternative remedies. 
(a)  Misdemeanor penalty. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, where no specific criminal penalty is provided therefor, whenever in any ordinance, any act is prohibited, or made or declared to be unlawful or a misdemeanor, or the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be prohibited, unlawful or a misdemeanor, each separate violation of such provision shall be a misdemeanor, for which the maximum fine shall be $50.00 and for which the maximum imprisonment shall be 30 days. Unless provided otherwise, limits on criminal fines do not imply limits on noncriminal or other criminal remedies. 
(b)  Civil penalties for parking violations. 
(1)  Whenever in any ordinance, any act of vehicle parking is prohibited or is made or declared unlawful, or the doing of any act of vehicle parking is required, or the failure to do any act of vehicle parking is declared to be unlawful, the violation of such provision shall subject the offender to a civil penalty to be recovered by the city in a civil action in the nature of debt if the offender, or the registered owner of the vehicle, does not pay the penalty within ten days of the violation. The violations shall not be deemed criminal and no criminal penalty shall be imposed therefor. 
(2)  Whenever in any ordinance, any act of vehicle parking is prohibited or made or declared to be unlawful, or the doing of any act of vehicle parking is required, or the failure to do any act of vehicle parking is prohibited or declared to be unlawful, whether the violation occurs on a street, or on a public vehicular area as defined in G.S. 20-4.01(32), or on any land or in any building owned by or leased to the city, or where the city operates a parking facility, it shall be prima facie evidence in any court that such vehicle was parked and operated at the time of the violation by the person in whose name such vehicle is then registered and licensed according to the records of the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles, or similar agency of any other state for vehicles not registered or licensed in this state, and such person in whose name such vehicle is then registered shall be subject to the same civil penalty provided by the applicable ordinance, to be recovered by the city in a civil action in the nature of debt if the civil penalty is not paid within ten days of such violation. The violations shall not be deemed criminal and no criminal penalty shall be imposed therefor. 
(3)  In addition to the above penalties, the city manager may immobilize by the use of wheel locks and tow and impound any vehicle which is illegally parked in violation of chapter 66, article IV, and charge a vehicle immobilization fee, as a civil penalty, of $50.00, to be recovered by the city in a civil action in the nature of debt if the fee is not paid within ten days of the attachment of the wheel lock to the vehicle. 
(4)  Violations for which civil penalties may be imposed pursuant to this section 1-9(b) are not criminal, and no criminal penalty shall be imposed therefor. 
(c)  Infractions for vehicle operation violations. Whenever in any ordinance, any act of vehicle operation (except parking) is prohibited, or is made or declared to be unlawful, or whenever in any ordinance, the doing of any act of vehicle operation (except parking) is required or the failure to do any act of vehicle operation (except parking) is prohibited or made or declared to be unlawful, the violation of such provision shall constitute an infraction, and the person found responsible for such infraction shall pay a penalty not to exceed $50.00, which shall be recovered as provided by law for the violation of infractions. 
(d)  Continuing offenses. Except as otherwise provided, each day's continuing violation of any ordinance shall be a separate and distinct offense for purposes of all remedies, including civil and criminal. 
(e)  Enforcement alternatives. Except as otherwise provided, violation of any ordinance may be enforced by one, all, or any combination of the remedies authorized. 
(f)  Penalty not excuse. The imposition or payment of a penalty, fine, or punishment shall not be construed to excuse any violation of any ordinance. 
(g)  [Late payment charges.] The city council has found that it is in the public interest to impose late payment charges on certain civil penalties because late payment charges may help ensure that the penalties are paid on time. The date of delinquency shall be the date described by the ordinance, resolution, or other legal authority establishing when the civil penalty is delinquent or past due. If an ordinance, resolution or other legal authority does not establish the date of delinquency, then the civil penalty shall be delinquent 60 days after it is payable. A rate of interest of eight percent simple interest per year shall be imposed on the following civil penalties from the date they become delinquent: all civil penalties, denominated as such, provided for by division 2 of article III of chapter 46 (fire prevention code); and article IV of chapter 46 (police and fire alarm systems).

Sec. 1-10. - Designation of powers and duties. 
(a)  For purposes of this section, a "subordinate" of the city manager includes a department, division, title, office, or position over which the city manager exercises supervision or control. 
(b)  Where an ordinance or resolution specifies that a particular subordinate of the city manager shall have certain powers or duties, the city manager shall nevertheless have the authority to transfer or assign any of such powers and duties to any other subordinate or to exercise any of such powers and duties himself or herself. The transfer or assignment may be in any manner that the city manager deems appropriate, for example, by designating an individual, officer, job title, department, division, department head, or division head or by allowing other appropriate persons to make the transfer or assignment. The city manager shall have the authority to change those designations from time to time as he or she deems proper. Any designee or subordinate of the city manager may further designate to the extent allowed by the city manager. 
(c)  This section applies except to the extent it is inconsistent with the manifest intent of the council, the context clearly requires otherwise, or it conflicts with state or federal law. The principle that the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another will not alone generally be sufficient to prevent the application of subsection (b) of this section. 
Sec. 1-11. - Powers of city manager regarding hearings, applications, permits, and licenses. 
(a)  Hearings. Where ordinances allow the city manager or the city council to do an act or make a decision, and the constitution of the United States or North Carolina requires a hearing to be held before the act or decision, after the act or decision, or both before and after, but the ordinance does not explicitly require such hearings, the city manager or the city council shall hold the constitutionally required hearings. 
(b)  Applications. Where an application is required or appropriate, for example, before the city will allow or take some action, the city manager may require as a condition precedent to the allowance or taking of the action that an application in a form that the city manager determines to be appropriate be submitted to the city. 
(c)  Licenses and permits. Where the city may issue a permit or license, the city manager may require as a condition precedent to the issuance of the permit or license that the prospective permittee or licensee complete and submit an application. 
Sec. 1-12. - Geographical applicability. 
    Ordinances and resolutions are presumed to be effective within the applicable jurisdiction of the city. Depending on the context, an ordinance may be effective on and to property and rights-of-way belonging to the city and located outside the corporate limits. This section is not intended to restrict the authority of the city to summarily remove, abate, or remedy that which is dangerous or prejudicial to the public health or public safety. 
Sec. 1-13. - Time of effectiveness of acts of council. 
    Ordinances and resolutions will be effective as of the time of adoption by the city council, unless inconsistent with the manifest intent of the council or the context clearly requires otherwise. 
Sec. 1-14. - References to previous codes. 
    Unless contrary to the manifest intent of the city council, whenever a reference is made in any ordinance or resolution to a portion of the City Code as the code existed before the adoption of this Code, that reference shall be deemed to refer to the portion of the recodified code that most nearly corresponds to the portion of the City Code as it existed before the adoption of this recodified version. 
Sec. 1-15. - Method of showing changes to ordinances by underlining and strike-throughs. 
(a)  Whenever an ordinance states that (i) a previously adopted ordinance or a portion thereof is revised thereby to read in a specified manner, and (ii) the previously adopted ordinance or a portion thereof is set out showing material underlined or struck through, or both, the rule of construction to be applied is: the material underlined is being added to the previously adopted ordinance, and the underlining itself is not part of the revised ordinance; and the material struck through is being deleted from the previously adopted ordinance. 
(b)  Whenever a new chapter, article, division, subdivision, section, subsection, part, or subpart is added to the City Code or the fee schedule, and that chapter, article, division, subdivision, section, subsection, part, or subpart is underlined, the underlining is not part of the City Code or fee schedule, but is merely an illustration that the material is new. 
(c)  This section is not intended to require that material in proposed ordinances be underlined or struck through. 
(d)  Underlining in this section refers to a single underline. 
(e)  This section applies except where the manifest intent of the council or the context requires otherwise. 
(f)  This section does not apply to underling beneath a column of numbers where immediately beneath the underlining is the result of addition or subtraction of numbers in the column. 
(g)  This section applies to all ordinances adopted or and after May 20, 2013, including those in the City Code, the Unified Development Ordinance, traffic regulation and control ordinances listed in the schedule in City Code section 66-345, and the fee schedule. 
(h)  This section does not apply to franchises granted pursuant to section 67 et seq. of the Charter or pursuant to G.S. 160A-76, or to the emergency operations plan adopted pursuant to section 22-21.

    However, deer hunting by bow and arrow or crossbow ("collectively archery"), as defined by the state wildlife resources commission, is permitted on private property during the Central North Carolina deer archery season as established by the state wildlife resources commission. A person may engage in deer archery on his or her own property if he or she has on his or her person a valid state hunting license (or qualifies for an exemption from licensing by the state wildlife resources commission), or on the property of another in their absence if he or she has on his or her person both a valid state hunting license (or qualifies for an exemption from licensing by the state wildlife resources commission) and written permission from the property owner or the property owner's authorized agent or manager. Parcels or tracts of land that are either owned by a person engaged in deer archery or for which that person has been given written permission to hunt shall be referred to as "areas of consent". Deer archery may only occur within areas of consent when the following requirements are met: 
(1)  Deer archery must be conducted from a permanent or portable elevated platform of at least ten feet above the ground; and 
(2)  Areas of consent must be greater than five acres in area and may be comprised of contiguous parcels or tracts; and 
(3)  No arrow shall be discharged within 250 feet of any residential dwelling, school, church, commercial building, governmental property, occupied structure, street, park, or other recreational area, nor shall any arrow be discharged within 250 feet of the perimeter of the area of consent; and 
(4)  Hunters shall make every reasonable effort to track wounded deer for the purpose of completing the harvest and recovering the carcass; and 
(5)  There is a valid hunting season in effect for which the hunting license applies at the time the bow or crossbow is discharged; and 
(6)  The hunter adheres to all applicable state and local regulations; and 
(7)  The person discharging the bow or crossbow exercises reasonable regard for the safety and property of other persons. 
    On a biennial basis the city manager shall make a report to city council regarding deer archery within the city. This report shall include available information on the number of deer harvested, any impact on the number of deer interference incidents, and any safety issues that may arise.

(d)  Emergency repairs. Upon a showing that a condition in a dwelling or dwelling unit poses an immediate threat of danger or harm to the safety of the occupants in such dwelling or dwelling unit, the housing appeals board shall adopt an ordinance ordering the administrator to repair such condition. The owner of and parties in interest in such dwelling or dwelling unit shall be given at least 72 hours' notice prior to the making of any repairs or improvements by the administrator.

(e)  Preliminary investigation; notice, hearing. 
(1)  Whenever a petition is filed with the administrator by a public authority or by at least five residents of the city charging that any dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit is unfit for human habitation, or whenever it appears to the administrator, upon inspection, that any such place is unfit for human habitation he or she shall, if his or her preliminary investigation disclosed a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit a complaint stating the charges and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the administrator at a place therein fixed, not less than ten nor more than 30 days after the serving of such complaint. 
(2)  It shall be unlawful for the owner or the agent of any owner upon whom such complaint has been served to permit any person to occupy any such dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit which, at the time of service of such complaint is vacant, or which shall subsequently become vacant, until such owner or the agent of such owner shall have obtained from the administrator a housing certificate.

(h)  Notice of lis pendens (notice of pending housing code complaint or order binding on successors and assigns of owner). Any complaint and notice or order issued pursuant to this article may be filed in the notice of lis pendens, with a copy of the complaint and notice or order attached thereto, in the office of the clerk of superior court of the county.

(i)  Findings of facts; issuance of order to repair, demolish, etc. If, after such notice and hearing as provided for in subsection (e), the administrator determines that the housing under consideration is unfit for human habitation under the terms of this article, he or she shall state in writing his or her findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order: 
(1)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of such house can be made at a cost not to exceed 50 percent of the value of the house, the order shall require the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve such house to render it fit for human habitation. The order may require that the property be vacated and closed only if continued occupancy during the time allowed for repair will present a significant threat of bodily harm, taking into account the nature of the necessary repairs, alterations, or improvements; the current state of the property; and any additional risks due to the presence and capacity of minors under the age of 18 or occupants with physical or mental disabilities. 
(2)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of such housing cannot be made at a cost not to exceed 50 percent of the value of the housing, the order shall require the owner, within the time specified in the order to repair, alter or improve such housing to render it fit for human habitation or to demolish and remove such housing. However, notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the dwelling is located in a historic district of the city and the historic district commission determines, after a public hearing, that the dwelling is of particular significance or value toward maintaining the character of the district, and the dwelling has not been condemned as unsafe, the order may require that the dwelling be vacated and closed consistent with G.S. 160A-400.14(a). 
(j)  Failure to comply with order. 
(1)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter or improve or to vacate and close the dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit, the administrator may cause such dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit to be repaired, altered or improved or to be vacated and closed; and the administrator may cause to be posted on the main entrance of any dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit so closed, a placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for human habitation; the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited and unlawful." Occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a misdemeanor. 
(2)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the dwelling, the administrator may cause such dwelling to be removed or demolished; provided, however, that the duties of the administrator as set forth in this subsection and subsection (j)(1) of this section shall not be exercised until the housing appeals board shall have by ordinance ordered the administrator to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this section with respect to the particular property which the administrator shall have found to be unfit for human habitation and which property shall be described in the ordinance. No such ordinance shall be adopted to require demolition of a dwelling until the owner has first been given a reasonable opportunity to bring it into conformity with the housing code. Such ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the county and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. 
(3)  If the housing appeals board has adopted an ordinance as provided in subsection (2) of this section authorizing vacating and closing of the dwelling, or if the administrator shall have commenced proceedings under this article requiring a dwelling to be repaired or vacated and closed, and if the dwelling has been vacated and closed for a period of 6 months pursuant to the ordinance or after such proceedings have commenced, then if the housing appeals board shall find that the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter or improve the dwelling in order to render it fit for human habitation and that the continuation of the dwelling in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the city in that the dwelling would continue to deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities, would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in the area, and would render unavailable property and a dwelling which might otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent and affordable housing in this state, then in such circumstances the housing appeals board may, after the expiration of such six-month period, enact an ordinance and serve such ordinance on the owner, setting forth the following: 
a.  If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it fit for human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding 50 percent of the then current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner either repair or demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days; or 
b.  If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceeding 50 percent of the then current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days. 
This ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. If the owner fails to comply with this ordinance, the administrator shall effectuate the purpose of the ordinance. 
(k)  Costs of lien on premises. 
(1)  The amount of the cost of repairs, alterations or improvements, or vacating and closing, or removal or demolition by the administrator shall be a lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred, which lien shall be filed, have the same priority, and be collected as provided by G.S. 160A-216 et seq. 
(2)  The amount of the cost of repairs, alterations or improvements, or vacating and closing, or removal or demolition by the administrator shall be a lien on any other real property of the owner located within the city limits or within one mile thereof except for the owner's primary residence. The additional lien provided in this subsection is inferior to all prior liens and shall be collected as a money judgment. 
(3)  If the dwelling is removed or demolished by the administrator, he or she shall sell the materials of the dwelling and any personal property, fixtures or appurtenances found in or attached to the dwelling, and shall credit the proceeds of the sale against the cost of the removal or demolition and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court by the administrator, shall be secured in a manner directed by the court, and shall be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of the court. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings, or otherwise. 
(l)  Placarding. After the failure of an owner of a dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit to comply with an order of the administrator issued pursuant to this article and upon adoption by the housing appeals board of an ordinance authorizing and directing him or her to do so, as provided by G.S. 160A-443(4) and this article, the administrator shall proceed to cause such dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit to be repaired, altered or improved to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this article, or to be vacated and closed, or removed or demolished, as directed by the ordinance of the housing appeals board, and shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of such place of habitation a placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for human habitation, the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited and unlawful. The occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a misdemeanor." 
(m)  Cancellation or reduction of demolition and other remediation liens in limited circumstances. 
(1)  The city manager may authorize the reduction or cancellation of the amount of the cost of repairs, alterations, or improvements; vacating and closing; securing, or removal or demolition, or other remediation by the administrator which is a lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred as provided for in this article, or other appropriate provisions of law, in the following circumstances: 
a.  When the owner of the property completes construction of a dwelling on the property to be used for affordable housing. The owner must also obtain and provide a certificate of compliance from the city/county inspections department. 
b.  When the owner of the property conveys the property subject to the lien to a person who completes construction of a dwelling on the property to be used for affordable housing. Completion of construction shall be evidenced by a certificate of compliance issued by the city/county inspections department. 
(2)  The city council may, in its discretion, reduce or cancel the cost described in this subsection, when the cost is past due, the owner offers to convey the property to the city and the city council agrees to accept the deed to the property in payment of the cost. 
(3)  The city manager shall establish a policy to implement this subsection. The policy shall define "affordable housing," and contain criteria for which owners may apply for the reduction or cancellation of a lien under this subsection. The policy shall include other provisions designed to effectuate the purposes of this subsection. Such other provisions may include time limits for completion of construction of the dwelling, descriptions of covenants to be incorporated in the title to property conveyed to ensure it will used for affordable housing; and requirements that a lien be in effect for a specified period of time before the manager will consider reducing or canceling a lien under this subsection. For each instance of exercising the authority to reduce or cancel a lien under this subsection, the city manager shall make a record of the reasons why such action is appropriate. 
(4)  This subsection also applies to liens arising from the enforcement of the state Unsafe Building law (G.S. 160A-424 et seq.), nonresidential building code, and abatement of public health nuisances (G.S. § 160A-193). 
(5)  In this subsection (m), references to "this subsection" mean "this subsection (m). 
(n)  Notice to affordable housing agencies. Whenever a determination is made pursuant to subsection (i) of this section that a dwelling must be vacated and closed, or removed or demolished, under the provisions of this article, notice of the order shall be given by first-class mail to any organization involved in providing or restoring dwellings for affordable housing that has filed a written request for such notices. A minimum period of 45 days from the mailing of such notice shall be given before removal or demolition by action of the administrator, to allow the opportunity for any organization to negotiate with the owner to make repairs, lease, or purchase the property for the purpose of providing affordable housing. The city clerk shall certify the mail of the notices, and the certification shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. Only an organization that has filed a written request for such notices may raise the issue of failure to mail such notices, and the sole remedy shall be an order required the administrator to wait 45 days before causing removal or demolition. 
(o)  Alternative remedies. Neither this article nor any of its provisions shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their abatement by summary action or otherwise, and the enforcement of any remedy provided herein shall not prevent the enforcement of any other remedies provided herein or in other ordinances or laws. 
(p)  Conflict with other provisions. In the event any provision, standard or requirement of this section is found to be in conflict with any other applicable law, code or ordinance pertaining to housing, the provision which establishes the higher standard or more stringent requirement for the promotion and protection of the health and safety of the residents of the city shall prevail.

Sec. 10-240. - Appeal from order of administrator. 
(a)  Appeal. Where compliance with an order of the administrator, or where the literal application of the provisions of this article, would appear to cause undue hardship on an owner or other party in interest, or when it is claimed that the true intent and meaning of this article or any of the minimum standards or requirements herein has been wrongly interpreted, the owner or other party in interest may appeal from the order of the administrator to the housing appeals board ("board"). 
(1)  Notice of appeal shall be in writing and filed with the housing code administrator within ten days after service of the order of the administrator. The administrator shall place the appeal on the agenda for hearing by the board at its next regular meeting or if that is not possible within a reasonable time. 
(2)  When an appeal is from a decision of the administrator refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, the administrator's decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed by the board. 
(3)  When any appeal is from a decision of the administrator requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirements until the hearing by the board, unless the administrator certifies to the board that because of facts in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished to the appellant), a suspension of the requirements would cause imminent peril to life or property. In which case the requirements shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than one day's written notice to the administrator, by the board or by a court of record upon petition made to the Durham County Superior Court. 
(b)  Action by the board. 
(1)  The board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make any decision and order that in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of the administrator, but the concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the administrator. 
(2)  The board upon such appeal, and after a hearing, may extend the time for compliance with the administrator's order, or vary the application of any provisions of this article in hardship cases when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this article or the public interest, or when, in its opinion the interpretation of the administrator was wrong and should be modified or reversed. In hardship cases, a hardship peculiar to the appellant must be shown. 
(3)  A decision of the board to extend the time for compliance with an order of the administrator, or to vary the application of any provision of this article, or to modify an order of the administrator, shall specify in what manner such extension, variation, or modification is made, the conditions upon which it is made, and the reasons therefore. 
(4)  Every such decision of the board shall be in writing, and shall be promptly filed in the office of the administrator, and shall be open to public inspection; a certified copy shall be sent by mail, or otherwise, to the appellant. 
(5)  If a decision of the board reverses or modifies a refusal, order or disallowance of the administrator, or varies the application of any provision of this article, the administrator shall immediately take action in accordance with such decision. 
(6)  Every decision of the board shall be subject to review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari as provided in state law. 
(c)  Petition to superior court. Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the administrator or a decision rendered by the board may petition the Durham County Superior Court for an injunction restraining the administrator from carrying out the order or decision as provided in state law.

(2)  It shall be unlawful for the owner or agent of the owner in charge of such dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit with respect to which an order has been issued pursuant to this article, to occupy or permit the occupancy of the same in a dilapidated or deteriorated condition found to be unfit for human habitation in violation of such order for its repair, alteration or improvement or its vacation, closing or demolition, and each day that such unlawful occupancy continues after the expiration of the time prescribed in the order to repair, alter, improve, vacate, close or demolish such dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.

(b)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  Any owner of a dwelling or dwelling unit, except an owner who occupies the dwelling as his or her principal place of residence, who fails to comply with any of the provisions of this article shall be subject to a civil penalty. 
a.  The initial civil penalty shall be $300.00 and an additional civil penalty of $300.00 shall be imposed each month. The penalty shall be imposed until the dwelling or dwelling unit is brought into compliance. However, the maximum cumulative civil penalty shall not exceed $5,000.00. This penalty may be recovered by the city in a civil action in the nature of debt if the owner does not pay the same within 30 days after the initial day of noncompliance. 
b.  The administrator shall formulate written guidelines to use in assessing and calculating civil penalties. Such written guidelines shall authorize the city manager to discharge certain penalties deemed uncollectible by the finance department director after good faith efforts have been made to collect such penalties. 
c.  An owner may request, in writing to the administrator, reduction or cancellation of a civil penalty imposed pursuant to this subsection (subsection (b)(1)). The city manager or his/her designee may authorize the reduction or cancellation of a civil penalty.

(2)  The city manager may agree, in writing only, to release, in whole or in part, a subsequent owner from liability for a civil penalty imposed pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section under the following circumstances: 
a.  The previous owner incurred a civil penalty due to failure to comply with the administrator's order to bring the house into compliance; 
b.  When the subsequent owner acquired the same house, it was still not in compliance with the administrator's order, and a civil penalty was assessed against the subsequent owner as provided in subsection(b)(1); and 
c.  The subsequent owner agrees to bring the house into compliance within an agreed upon timeframe. 
However, if the subsequent owner fails to comply with the agreement, then the civil penalty shall remain and be computed from the date that the subsequent owner acquired the house. 
(c)  Fees. 
(1)  The owner of any dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit who fails to repair or vacate and close it, or demolish or remove it, upon order of the administrator duly made and served as herein provided, within the time specified in such order, shall be subject to an administrative fee set by the city council for noncompliance. This fee allows the city to recover some of its administrative costs incurred due to the owner's failure to comply with the administrator's order described herein. 
(2)  Any owner of a dwelling or dwelling unit, except an owner who uses the dwelling as his or her principal place of residence, who requests a re-inspection after failing an initial inspection shall be subject to a re-inspection fee when the re-inspection shows that the owner's dwelling still fails to comply with the provisions of this article. The re-inspection fee shall not be imposed when the owner's dwelling passes the re-inspection. Re-inspection fees adopted by the city council shall be charged.

The action to vacate the dwelling shall be in the nature of summary ejectment and shall be commenced by filing a complaint naming as parties-defendant any person occupying such dwelling. The clerk of superior court shall issue a summons requiring the defendant to appear before a magistrate at a certain time, date and place not to exceed ten days from the issuance of the summons to answer the complaint. The summons and complaint shall be served as provided in G.S. 42-29. The summons shall be returned according to its tenor, and if on its return it appears to have been duly served, and if at the hearing the administrator produces a certified copy of an ordinance adopted by the housing appeals board pursuant to this article authorizing the administrator to proceed to vacate the occupied dwelling, the magistrate shall enter judgment ordering that the premises be vacated and that all persons be removed. The judgment ordering that the dwelling be vacated shall be enforced in the same manner as the judgment for summary ejectment entered under G.S. 42-30. An appeal from any judgment entered hereunder by the magistrate may be taken as provided in G.S. 7A-228, and the execution of such judgment may be taken as provided in G.S. 7A-227. An action to remove an occupant of a dwelling may not be in the nature of a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant to this subsection unless such occupant was served with notice at least 30 days before the filing of the summary ejectment proceeding that the housing appeals board has ordered the administrator to proceed to exercise his or her duties under this article to vacate and close or remove and demolish the dwelling.

Chapter 18 - CONTRACTING WITH THE CITY 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Secs. 18-1-18-18. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - LIVABLE WAGE 

Sec. 18-19. - Service contracts with the city. 
    It is the policy of the city that all service contractors doing business with the city pay their workers an hourly wage while working on city service contracts that is equivalent to or greater than the livable wage set in section 18-23 of the Code. 
(Code 1982, § 27-1; Ord. No. 11333, § 1, 1-20-1998; Ord. No. 13744, 12-1-2008; Ord. No. 15012, § 1, 10-3-2016) 
Sec. 18-20. - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter, the following terms have the meanings indicated, unless the context clearly requires a different meaning: 
    Livable wage means the minimum hourly wage rate that shall be paid to those who work on service contracts with the city. 
    Person means any individual, business entity, corporation, limited liability company (LLC), partnership or joint venture. 
    Service contract means a contract designated by the city manager as a service contract subject to this chapter. These shall include only those contracts for services to the city and its agencies which the city could provide for itself with its own employees, should it decide to do so, and shall not include contracts governed by state or federal procurement or bidding requirements, or those where services are performed by nonprofit, tax-exempt organizations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city council may make a determination that a contract with a nonprofit tax exempt organization is one for which the city could have provided the contracted service with its own employees, and that upon such determination the contract shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. 
    Service contractor means the person awarded a city service contract, specifically including all subcontractors of service contractors. 
    Service worker means any employee of a service contractor, except for those persons occupying part-time positions where the job duties are not substantially the same as any full time position of an employee of the city. 
(Code 1982, § 27-2; Ord. No. 11333, § 1, 1-20-1998; Ord. No. 13744, 12-1-2008) 
Sec. 18-21. - Administration of the livable wage. 
(a)  Each service contractor shall pay its employees working on city service contracts a livable wage during those hours that the employees work on city service contracts. 
(b)  The city has determined that it is an important goal to ensure that employees of its service contractors earn a livable wage, and has therefore made it mandatory that contractors bidding on city service contracts comply with this chapter. In order to accomplish the statutory objectives of this chapter, the city narrows its pool of eligible contractors, because some contractors will not be eligible for consideration for such contracts. Therefore, when a service contractor who has been awarded a city service contract subject to this chapter fails to fulfill the requirements of this chapter, the city suffers damages. The precise dollar amount of those damages is difficult to ascertain. Therefore, all service contracts falling under this chapter shall include language in substantial conformance with the following paragraph: 
"In the event of a finding by the city manager or a judicial officer that any service worker has been paid less than the compensation to which the service worker is entitled under the city's livable wage ordinance, contractor shall make restitution to the service worker for the amount due. Contractor shall also pay liquidated damages to the city in the amount of $50.00 per day for each employee so underpaid, provided, however, that these damages shall not be assessed for wage underpayment violations to any individual which amount to a total of less than $1.00 in any payroll period. Should a service worker be found to have been discriminated against for seeking to enforce the provisions of the city's livable wage ordinance, and if the service worker has been terminated from employment, he or she shall be reinstated upon an order to do so from the city manager or a judicial officer. A flyer stating the city's livable wage amount shall be posted at the workplace of every service contractor in a location easily seen by all employees." 
(c)  When a service contractor has been found to have failed to pay a livable wage in the course of performing more than three separate service contracts in a two-year period, the city manager may prohibit that service contractor from participating in future service contracts for up to three years. 
(d)  Within one year from the date of work performed on a service contract, a service worker may file a protest in writing with the city manager claiming that the amount of wages paid to that worker on that service contract was less than the livable wage at the time the work was performed. 
(e)  A service contractor shall not discharge, reduce the compensation or otherwise discriminate against any service worker for seeking to enforce the provisions of this chapter. Actions protected under this chapter include, but are not limited to, making a complaint to the city manager, participating in any city proceedings, or making use of any civil remedies. If any violation of this subsection is found to have occurred, the city manager may order appropriate restitution and the reinstatement of such service worker, in accordance with the terms of the service contract. 
(f)  The city may withhold or cause to be withheld from the service contractor so much of any accrued payments owed to the contractor as may be necessary to: 
(1)  Pay the service workers employed by the service contractor the full amount of wages required by the provisions of this chapter; and 
(2)  Satisfy any liability of the contractor for liquidated damages accrued under the terms of the service contract. 
    The city may withhold payments from any service contractor who has failed to post and keep posted a copy of the livable wage as required herein, until such default of the service contract's terms shall have been corrected. 
(g)  The city manager shall cause investigations to be made as may be necessary to determine whether there has been compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the regulations promulgated thereunder, and those contained in the service contract. The service contractor shall permit representatives of the city to observe work being performed upon the work site, to interview service workers and to examine the books and records relating to the payrolls on the project being investigated to determine the correctness of classifications and any payment of proper regular and overtime rates as required. All such information provided by the service contractor will be treated as confidential, to the extent permitted by G.S. ch. 132, the Public Records Law, as it may be amended from time to time. Complaints of alleged violations shall be investigated promptly and statements, written or oral, made by a service worker shall be treated as confidential and shall not be disclosed to the service contractor without the consent of the service worker. 
(h)  If necessary for the enforcement of this heading, the city manager may issue subpoenas, compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, records, and documents relating to payroll records necessary for investigations and hearings. Any such subpoena shall be served by the sheriff of the county. In case of refusal to obey or fully comply with any such subpoena, the person not complying may be summoned before the general court of justice, and upon failure to give satisfactory explanation of such failure or refusal, the court shall find the failure to be a misdemeanor violating section 19 of the City Charter, such violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $100.00 per day or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 30 days. In addition, the general court of Justice may issue any civil orders as may be within its jurisdiction in order to enforce subpoenas issued under this chapter. 
(Code 1982, § 27-3; Ord. No. 11333, § 1, 1-20-1998; Ord. No. 13744, 12-1-2008) 
Sec. 18-22. - Intentional violation a misdemeanor. 
    In the event the city manager shall determine, after notice and hearing, that any service contractor has failed to pay the livable wage or has otherwise violated the provisions of this chapter and that such failure was intentional, no contract shall be awarded to such service contractor, or to any business in which such service contractor has an interest, until one year has elapsed from the date of such determination. Provided, further, that any such intentional violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be a misdemeanor, the maximum fine for which shall be $500.00. Proceedings before the city manager shall not be considered a pre-condition to criminal prosecution under this chapter. Each day's violation shall constitute a separate offense.

Sec. 18-23. - Setting the livable wage rate.

The modified ULW methodology calculates a livable wage as follows: (1) Determine the average monthly cost of fair market rents for a one bedroom apartment over the most recent four full years of available data according to the rates reflected in the Durham-Chapel Hill, NC HUD Metro FMR Area, (2) Divide that average monthly cost by 0.30 to find the 30% monthly gross income needed to cover the cost of housing, (3) Multiply the monthly gross income figure allocated to housing by 12 to derive an annualized salary needed to cover housing at a minimum, and (4) Divide that annualized salary amount by 2,080 (the number of hours worked per year assuming 40 hours of work for 52 weeks) to determine a minimum livable hourly wage rate. The abbreviated formula is ([4 year blended FMR (1BR)/0.30] x 12) / 2080.

The contract specific goals for the contract classifications shall be maintained by the director. 
(c)  The city manager shall periodically evaluate, and if appropriate, make adjustments to the contract specific goals applied to the contract classifications for MBEs and WBEs during the life of program as necessary to maintain the integrity and purpose of the program. 
(Ord. No. 14907, § 1, 3-21-2016) 
Sec. 18-57. - Counting participation of UBEs. 
(a)  The entire amount of that portion of a construction contract that is performed by the UBE's own forces shall be counted, as well as the cost of goods obtained or leased by the UBE for the work of the contract (except goods the UBE subcontractor or joint venture partner purchases or leases from the prime contractor or its affiliate). 
(b)  The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a UBE for providing a bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services. 
(c)  When a UBE performs as a participant in a joint venture, only the portion of the total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the joint venture's contract that the UBE performs with its own forces and for which it is separately at risk shall be counted. 
(d)  Only expenditures to a UBE that is performing a commercially useful function shall be counted. To determine whether a firm is performing a commercially useful function, the city will evaluate the amount of work contracted (whether by prime contract or subcontract), industry practices, whether the amount the firm is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and other relevant factors. To perform a commercially useful function, the UBE must be responsible, with respect to goods used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the goods, installing (where applicable) and paying for the goods itself. A UBE does not perform a commercially useful function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of UBE participation. If a UBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would be expected on the basis of normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a commercially useful function. When a UBE is presumed not to be performing a commercially useful function, the UBE may present evidence to rebut this presumption at a time and manner as determined by the city manager. 
(e)  One hundred percent of the cost of the goods obtained from a UBE manufacturer or regular dealer shall be counted. The term "manufacturer" means a firm that operates or maintains a factory or establishment that produces, on the premises, the goods required under the contract. The term "regular dealer" means a firm that owns, operates, or maintains a store, warehouse, or other establishment in which the goods of the general character described by the specifications or required under the contract are bought, kept in stock, and regularly sold or leased to the public in the usual course of business. To be a regular dealer, the firm must be an established business that engages, as its principal business and under its own name, in the purchase and sale or lease of the goods. Packagers, manufacture representatives, or other persons who arrange or expedite transactions are not regular dealers. 
(f)  One hundred percent of the fees for the delivery of goods required on a job site shall be counted only if the payment and amount of such fees are customary in the applicable industry. The cost of the goods shall not be counted towards the fees. 
(g)  If a UBE is decertified during its performance of a contract, the dollar value of work performed after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted. 
(h)  [Reserved.] 
(i)  In determining achievement of contract specific goals, the participation of a UBE shall not be counted until that amount has been paid to the UBE. 
(j)  If a UBE meets the definition of both an MBE and a and a WBE, it's participation may only be counted as either an MBE or WBE. 
(Ord. No. 14907, § 1, 3-21-2016) 
Sec. 18-58. - Contract pre-award compliance procedures. 
(a)  In all solicitations for which contract specific goals have been established, the bidder shall submit a participation plan when required by the city manager detailing all subcontractors from which the bidder solicited bids or quotations and its achievement of the contract specific goals or its good faith efforts to do so. The plan shall be submitted in accordance with the schedule and instructions required by the city manager. If the bidder fails to achieve the contract specific goals, documentation of its good faith efforts to do so is due at the time specified in the solicitation. The list of UBEs provided by the city to a bidder establishes the universe from which a bidder must solicit UBEs. 
(b)  Any agreement between a bidder and a UBE in which the bidder requires that the UBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other bidders is prohibited. 
(c)  UBEs shall respond to relevant requests for quotations. 
(d)  Where the bidder has not achieved the contract specific goals, the city manager will determine whether the bidder has made good faith efforts to achieve those goals. In making this determination, the city manager will consider, at a minimum, the bidder's efforts to: 
(1)  Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings, advertising and written or electronic notices) the interest of all UBEs certified in the scopes of work of the contract. The bidder shall provide interested UBEs with timely, adequate information about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow UBEs to respond to the solicitation. The bidder must follow up initial solicitations with interested UBEs. 
(2)  Select portions of the work to be performed by UBEs in order to increase the likelihood that the contract specific goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate UBE participation, even when the bidder would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. It is the bidder's responsibility to make a portion of the work available to UBEs and to select those portions of the work (including needs for goods) consistent with the availability of UBEs so as to facilitate UBE participation. 
(3)  Negotiate in good faith with interested UBEs. Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of UBEs that were contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and specific information on why agreements could not be reached with UBEs. The bidder may not reject UBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities. That there may be some additional costs involved in finding UBEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a bidder's failure to meet the contract specific goals, as long as such costs are commercially reasonable. The ability or desire of a bidder to perform the work of a contract with its own forces does not relieve it of the responsibility to make good faith efforts. 
(4)  Make efforts to assist interested UBEs in obtaining required bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as required by the city or contractor, or providing alternatives to bonding or insurance for subcontractors, if relevant to the work of the contract. 
(5)  Make efforts to assist interested UBEs in obtaining necessary goods or related assistance or services. 
(6)  Use the services of the city, available minority/women community organizations, minority and women contractors' groups, government sponsored minority/women business assistance agencies and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the recruitment of UBEs. 
(7)  Attend any pre-bid meetings scheduled by the city. 
(e)  In determining whether a bidder has made good faith efforts, the performance of other bidders in meeting the contract specific goals may be considered. 
(f)  A signed letter of intent from all listed UBEs describing the work, including goods and services to be performed or provided by the UBE and the agreed upon dollar value for bids or percentage of professional services pursuant to a request for proposals or description of the services to be rendered pursuant to a request for qualifications shall be due in accordance with the city manager's instructions. 
(g)  The city manager shall review the participation plan prior to award, including the scope of work and the letters of intent from UBEs. The city manager may request clarification in writing of items listed in the participation plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity to augment listed UBE participation or good faith efforts. 
(h)  If the city manager determines that the participation plan demonstrates that the contract specific goals have been achieved or good faith efforts were made, or that award is in the best interest of the city, then the city manager shall recommend award to the city council. 
(i)  If the city manager finds that a bidder did not make good faith efforts, the city manager shall send notice of the finding to the bidder. 
(1)  The bidder shall have seven days from receipt of the notice to notify the city manager of its request for a hearing. 
(2)  The city manager shall hold a hearing within 14 days, and shall control all aspects of the hearing, including scheduling, conduct, witnesses, and evidence, and may request the attendance of witnesses and production of documents. The bidder's failure to comply promptly with these directions and orders may be grounds for denial of the relief sought. 
(3)  The city manager shall send notice to the bidder of the written decision on the appeal within 14 days of the hearing. The city manager's decision shall be final. 
(Ord. No. 14907, § 1, 3-21-2016) 
Sec. 18-59. - Contract performance compliance procedures. 
(a)  Contracts shall provide that the participation plan is binding on the contractor. Contract specific goals become elements of performance by the contractor in favor of the city. 
(b)  The contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance of the contract, and subcontractor payment information to the city with each request for payment submitted to the city. The director and the user department shall monitor subcontractor participation during the course of the contract and shall have reasonable access to all contract-related documentation held by the contractor relevant to the contract. 
(c)  After the city and the contractor have executed the contract, the contractor shall not make changes to the participation plan or substitute UBEs named in the participation plan without the prior written approval of the city manager. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this article, and may constitute grounds to terminate the contract for breach, withhold payment, and/or subject the contractor to contract penalties or other sanctions. 
(1)  All requests for changes or substitutions of the subcontractors named in the participation plan shall be made to the city manager on a form provided or approved by the city, and shall clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A contractor shall not substitute a subcontractor or perform the work designated for a subcontractor with its own forces or with any other subcontractor unless and until the city manager approves such substitution in writing. A contractor shall not allow a substituted subcontractor to begin work until both the director and the city's project manager have approved the substitution. 
(2)  The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have been known by either party prior to the submission of the participation plan. The contractor must negotiate with the subcontractor to resolve the problem. If requested by either party, the city shall facilitate such a meeting. Where there has been a mistake or disagreement about the scope of work, the UBE can be substituted only where an agreement cannot be reached on commercially reasonable terms for the correct scope of work. 
(3)  The city manager shall allow changes or substitutions of the subcontractor only on the following bases: 
a.  Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed; 
b.  Failure of performance; 
c.  Financial incapacity; 
d.  Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price or qualifications description; 
e.  Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation where agreement on commercially reasonable terms cannot be reached; 
f.  Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding requirements; or 
g.  The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal or qualifications description. 
(4)  The city manager shall give written notice to the contractor and the affected subcontractor of the decision whether to permit or deny the proposed change or substitution. 
(5)  Where the contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of the city manager, or if the city requires the substitution of a subcontractor listed in the participation plan, the contractor shall make good faith efforts to fulfill the participation plan. The contractor may seek the assistance of the EO/EA department in obtaining a new UBE subcontractor. If the contract specific goals cannot be reached and good faith efforts have been made, the contractor may substitute with a non-UBE. 
(d)  If a contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously disclosed in the participation plan, the contractor shall obtain the approval of the city manager to modify the participation plan and must make new good faith efforts to ensure that UBEs have a fair opportunity to bid on the new scope of work. 
(e)  Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the user department at the time they arise, to establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the UBE goals. 
(f)  If the city manager determines that the contractor has failed to comply with the provisions of the contract, the city manager shall notify the contractor in writing of the deficiencies. The contractor shall have 14 days, or such time as specified in the contract, to cure the deficiencies or establish that there are no deficiencies. If the deficiencies are not cured, the city shall have the right to take all lawful actions.

Sec. 18-83. - Eligibility and certification process 
(a)  A person including an SDBE certified under article III, may be certified as an SLBE if the city manager finds that it:

(2)  Meets the size standards described in the U.S. Small Business Administration pursuant to 13 CFR 121.201, averaged over the last three years; 
(3)  Has (a) its principal office located within the geographic area defined by the counties of Durham, Chatham, Orange and Person (Durham MSA), or (b) a regional, branch or satellite office in which at least 25 percent of the full time employees reside in the Durham MSA and that has been established within the MSA for at least one year prior to the date of submission of application to the city for SLBE certification.

Certification for specific areas of work does not mean the SLBE is prequalified to bid on any city contract, including contracts included in the SLBE program. Certification does not constitute a finding that the SLBE meets the requirements that the city may have for contract award. 
(c)  The city shall certify the eligibility of joint ventures in which the joint venture partners are SLBEs.

(2)  Provided materially false or misleading information to the city in seeking certification. 
(b)  Failure of an SLBE to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation with the city manager within 90 [days] of notification of the expiration of its certification shall result in automatic decertification until such time that the city is able to recertify the SLBE pursuant to its normal application process. 
(1)  It is the responsibility of the SLBE to notify the city manager of any change in its circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the SLBE program. Failure to do so within a reasonable time of the change may result in the firm's decertification. 
(2)  The city manager shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria. 
(Ord. No. 14431, 4-1-2013) 
Sec. 18-85. - Protest if denied certification or recertification or decertification. 
    A person that has been denied certification or recertification or that has been decertified may protest the denial or decertification only as follows: 
(1)  Within seven days of receipt of denial of certification or recertification, or notice of decertification, the person may protest such action in writing to the city manager. The written protest must evidence that it was sent or postmarked within the seven days of receipt of denial of certification or recertification, or notice of decertification. 
(2)  A hearing shall be held by the city manager at which hearing the protester may present additional facts and evidence in support of its eligibility. The city manager shall control all aspects of the hearing, including scheduling, conduct, witnesses, and evidence, and may request the attendance of witnesses and production of documents. The protester's failure to comply promptly with these requests may be grounds for denial of relief sought by the protester. 
(3)  The city manager shall send notice of the written decision to the protester within 30 days of the hearing. The city manager's decision shall be final. 
(4)  A protester found to be ineligible to be certified as a SLBE shall not apply for certification for one year after the effective date of the final decision. However, if the denial or decertification is made in whole or in part because the protester had previous to the protest provided materially false or misleading information in support of its SLBE status the protester shall not apply for certification for two years after the effective date of the final decision.

a.  Construction and repair work involving the expenditure of public money less than $500,000.00; 
b.  Architectural, engineering or surveying services when the estimated contract price is less than $100,000.00; or 
c.  Other services, in which the estimated expenditure of city money is less than $500,000.00 if the city manager has, in his or her discretion, designated the contract for the SLBE program. 
(2)  That the city manager has found a sufficient number, but not fewer than three, of the SLBEs certified for the specific area of work, if applicable, may be available to bid on the proposed contract. 
(Ord. No. 14431, 4-1-2013) 
Sec. 18-87. - Termination of contract if SLBE status ends. 
    When the award of a contract is restricted to SLBEs pursuant to section 18-86, and the contractor's SLBE certification is revoked pursuant to section 18-84, the city manager has the authority to terminate the services of the contractor as of the date of revocation or as of a later date as provided by the notice of revocation. The termination does not affect accrued amounts owed to the contractor as of the date of termination. 
(Ord. No. 14431, 4-1-2013) 
Sec. 18-88. - Effect on equal business opportunity program.

Sec. 26-149. - Junked motor vehicles. 
(a)  Purpose. G.S. 160A-303.2 authorizes the city to regulate and to prohibit junked motor vehicles on public grounds and on private property. Pursuant to that authority, the city council finds that such regulation, restraint or prohibition is necessary and desirable to promote or enhance the:

In determining whether a vehicle constitutes a junked motor vehicle, the housing code administrator, in applying the specific criteria in the definition of a junked motor vehicle shall take into consideration, but not be limited to, whether the vehicle has a valid inspection decal as evidence of the stationary character of the vehicle, whether the tires, wheels and other essential parts of the vehicle are present for the operation of the vehicle, flat tires, removed parts, the condition of the exterior or any other specific evidence that would support a finding that the vehicle violates this section.

(d)  Required finding; order to remove. Upon investigation, the housing code administrator may order the removal of a junked motor vehicle as defined in this division from private property after finding in writing that the aesthetic benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens imposed on the private property owner. Such finding shall be based on a balancing of the monetary loss of the apparent owner against the corresponding gain to the public by promoting or enhancing community, neighborhood or area appearance. The following, among other relevant factors, may be considered by the housing code administrator: 
(1)  Protection of property values; 
(2)  Promotion of tourism and other economic development opportunity; 
(3)  Indirect protection of public health and safety; 
(4)  Preservation of the character and integrity of the community; and

(b)  If the motor vehicle does not have a license plate or other identification such that the housing code administrator can ascertain ownership, then the administrator shall provide notice by posting a warning notice on the vehicle by affixing it to the windshield or some other conspicuous place on the vehicle. The notice shall contain the date the vehicle will be towed and a telephone number to request a pre-tow hearing. The notice shall also state that the vehicle will be removed by the city on a specified date, no sooner than seven days after the notice is affixed to the vehicle, unless the vehicle is brought into compliance by the owner or legal possessor prior to that time. 
(c)  The owner or legal possessor may request a hearing within seven days after the notice is mailed or affixed to the vehicle. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and received by the housing code administrator within seven days of the date notice is affixed to the vehicle or mailed to the owner. 
(d)  The requirement that notice be affixed to an abandoned, hazardous or junked vehicle at least seven days prior to removal may be omitted in those circumstances where there is a special need for prompt action to eliminate traffic obstructions or to otherwise maintain and protect the public safety and welfare.

Service of notice by mailing is complete by depositing the notice in first class mail addressed to the owner or other person entitled to possession of the vehicle.

Any such vehicle ordered to be released as a result of a post-tow hearing may be reclaimed consistent with the terms of such order. 
(c)  Sale or destruction. When any junked motor vehicle, abandoned motor vehicle, or hazardous motor vehicle is removed, the department shall provide in its notice the information required by G.S. 20-114(c), 44A-4(c) and 44A-4(f). The housing code administrator is authorized to dispose of any vehicle removed by public or private sale 30 days after the maturity of the obligation to pay reasonable costs incidental to removal and storage if such vehicle has not been redeemed or the removal of such vehicle has not been contested. Any such sale shall be conducted by a sales procedure in accordance with G.S. 44A-4, 44A-5, and 44A-6, except that no hearing in addition to the probable cause hearing is required. If no one purchases the vehicle at the sale and if the value of the vehicle is less than the amount of the costs, the city may destroy the vehicle. 
(d)  Indemnity. A person requesting the city to remove a junked motor vehicle or abandoned motor vehicle or hazardous motor vehicle from private property shall indemnify the city against any loss, expense or liability incurred because of the removal, storage or sale thereof.

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 15436, § 2, adopted March 4, 2019, set out provisions intended for use as 26-231. For purposes of classification, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as a new article IX as herein set out. 

Sec. 26-246. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The purpose of sections 26-246 through 26-256 of this article is to establish guidelines for the routine cutting, pruning, and removal of trees and vegetation (sometimes referred to herein as "vegetation maintenance" or "vegetation management") by public utility companies on public streets or rights-of-way, city-owned or controlled property within the city limits and to encourage ,the promotion of urban tree canopy as much as is practical by ensuring the following: 
(1)  That the utility acknowledges the intrinsic value of trees, and that the city's goal of maintaining canopy over urban areas is not mutually exclusive to the utility's goal of providing reliable and affordable power. That the impact to individual trees within the city's tree canopy is kept to a minimum by virtue of vegetation maintenance activities in accordance with Arboricultural best practices as outlined by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) and the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA). 
(2)  That communication with respect to vegetation management is maintained between all utility companies and the city. 
(3)  That communication with respect to vegetation management is enhanced between the utility companies, on the one hand, and the city, communities and owners or residents of any occupied public or private property ("occupied property") on the other hand. 
(4)  That maintained or landscaped, occupied public or private property (referred to hereinafter as "occupied maintained property") receive certain protections with respect to the removal of trees from those properties. 
(5)  That the provision of safe and reliable overhead utility service is promoted. 
(6)  That overhead utilities are protected while decreasing the potential for service interruptions. 
(Ord. No. 15436, § 2, 3-4-2019) 
Sec. 26-247. - Duties of the city manager.

(Ord. No. 15436, § 2, 3-4-2019) 
Sec. 26-248. - Exceptions. 
    Although it is anticipated that the bulk of utility vegetation maintenance that will occur within the city will be of a routine nature that is governed by the provisions of sections 26-246 through 26-256 of this article, there are certain limited types of vegetation maintenance, as set forth below, hat are excepted from coverage under sections 26-246 through 26-256 of this article: 
(a)  Although sections 26-246 through 26-256 of this article apply to overhead electrical distribution lines, said sections do not apply to nor prohibit vegetation management activities pertaining to: (i) electrical transmission lines, or (ii) underground electrical distribution lines. The term "transmission lines" as it is used herein means electric utility lines energized at voltages 44,000 volts or greater and typically carried on steel poles or towers; however, some lower voltage transmission lines may be on wood pole structures. 
(b)  Sections 26-246 through 26-256 of this article do not apply to nor prohibit vegetation management activities pertaining to non-routine vegetation management which includes, without limitation, customer requested work (such as construction projects where new service lines are requested or projects where ,lines need to be relocated or extended), maintenance of overhead facilities (such as changing out transformers, other pole-mounted equipment or damaged or rotten poles), North Carolina Department of Transportation related work, addressing public safety incidents, or restoring the utility service following emergencies or any other unanticipated interruption or outage. 
(c)  Sections 26-246 through 26-256 of this article shall not apply to nor prohibit the vegetation maintenance of any tree or shrub on public or private property within the city limits, if such vegetation maintenance is done in order to repair or replace the same as a result of damage or deterioration as a result of accident, casualty, or natural elements such as wind, rain, ice, electrical storm, or the like. 
(Ord. No. 15436, § 2, 3-4-2019) 
Sec. 26-249. - Legality of chapter or parts thereof. 
    Should any section, clause or provision of sections 26-246 through 26-256 of this article be declared by the courts to be invalid, the same shall not affect the validity of any other provision of sections 26-246 through 26-256 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 15436, § 2, 3-4-2019) 
Sec. 25-250. - Violation of ordinance.

(Ord. No. 15436, § 2, 3-4-2019) 
Sec. 26-252. - Vegetation management communication. 
(1)  Communication between city and utilities. Each utility company will communicate with the city regarding vegetation maintenance as desired herein in connection with the annual vegetative maintenance plan, the operational plan, and the vegetation maintenance annual review. 
(2)  Communication between utility and owners or residents of occupied property. 
(a)  Notification to owners or residents of occupied property. Prior to the performance of vegetation maintenance by a utility on occupied property, the utility shall make reasonable efforts to provide prior notification of such activities to the owner or resident of occupied property. Such prior notification may include, but is not limited to, either of the following methods: (i) door hangers; and (ii) automated outbound telephone calling. Such prior notification shall be attempted at least five business days prior to the date that the vegetation maintenance is scheduled to commence, unless circumstances reasonably require a shorter time period. 
(b)  Meeting with owners or residents of occupied property. If an owner or resident of occupied property requests a meeting with a utility regarding vegetation maintenance that is to occur on said property, then the subject utility will make reasonable efforts to meet with the owner or resident of said property to discuss which trees will be impacted and which methods will be utilized by the utility in connection with the vegetation maintenance. 
(c)  Provision of authority. If an owner or resident of occupied property so requests, a utility subject to the jurisdiction of the North Carolina Utilities Commission shall provide a copy of written authority to perform vegetation maintenance on the property. Acceptable written authority may include, but not be limited to, pertinent service regulations on file with the North Carolina Utilities Commission. 
(Ord. No. 15436, § 2, 3-4-2019) 
Sec. 26-253. - Vegetation management standards, requirements and prohibited practices. 
(1)  Methods of pruning, trimming and cutting. 
(a)  To the extent the utility files a vegetative management plan with the North Carolina Utilities Commission, then the vegetative management plan and any revisions to the vegetation management plan required by the North Carolina Utilities Commission shall constitute the standards to be adhered to by the utility when performing vegetation management activities within the city limits. The most recent utility vegetation management plan may be found by accessing the links below: 
Utility's Vegetation Management Plan: http://ncuc.coinmerce.state.nc.us/cgi- bin/webview/senddoc.pgm?dispfmt=&itype=Q&authorization=&parm2=CA AAAA 16221B&parm3=000138905. 
The utility shall provide the city manager with notice of any proposed revision to its vegetation management plan on file at the North Carolina Utilities Commission that would impact its distribution system at the same time it files such proposed revision with the North Carolina Utilities Commission. 
(b)  Regardless of whether a utility files a vegetative management plan with the North Carolina Utilities Commission, a utility will comply with the following in connection with any vegetation maintenance within the city limits: 
1.  Vegetation maintenance shall be done using the "ANSI A300 method" (part 1) BMP manual compiled by the International Society of Arboriculture, and subsequent revisions. 
2.  Topping and rounding over of trees is prohibited. 
3.  Climbing irons, spurs, or spikes are not to be used unless m accordance with the ANSI A300 standard. 
4.  The use of "tree paint", "wound dressing" and similar substances is not recommended. 
5.  Under normal circumstances, no more than one-fourth of a tree's live crown should be removed per year. If reduction of more than one-fourth or twenty-five percent (25%) of a tree's crown is needed for safety and reliability clearances, or if the tree is otherwise a danger tree, the tree should be evaluated by the utility company for removal. The term danger tree, as it is used in sections 26-246 through 26-256 of this agreement, means a tree that has the potential of adversely impacting utility service by falling into a utility line as a result of being cut, blown into, or otherwise falling, by virtue of its physical condition. 
6.  When virulent disease is prevalent, as per notification of the city manager, the utility will work with the city manager to develop a reasonable plan to properly prune or remove the subject tree. This plan will be designed to prevent the spread of disease as a result of line maintenance activities. 
7.  For the removal of a limb the triple cut method shall be used if there is a possibility that the limb may tear out from the trunk if a single cut is made. 
8.  Utility companies shall use natural target pruning which requires all cuts to be made at laterals (limb junctions). These lateral limbs should be no less than one-third the diameter of the limb removed at the point of removal. The term lateral limb, as used herein, means a subordinate limb originating from a main branch or stem. 
9.  Limbs shall be pruned back to an appropriate new leader, angled away from or around the lines. In no circumstances are stubs or abruptly pruned limbs to be left by the pruning. The term leader, as used herein, means a dominant upright stem which is usually the main trunk of a tree. 
10.  No obvious "hangers" shall be left in the trees after performing line maintenance activities. The term "hanger" as used herein, means a cut limb that is left in a tree after pruning operations are complete. 
(2)  Determinations by utility companies that a tree is to be removed; appeal process. 
(a)  If a utility company determines that a tree must be removed in its entirety from occupied maintained property within the city limits, then the utility or its representative shall make reasonable efforts to seek the consent of the owner or resident of the occupied maintained property. Reasonable efforts by the utility or its representative to seek the consent of the owner or resident of the occupied maintained property may include any of the following, without limitation: (i) a request for consent to remove a tree set forth on a door hanger; (ii) a request for consent to remove a tree made in a communication with said owner or resident; (iii) a request for consent to remove a tree set forth in a message left on the answering machine or voicemail of said owner or resident; (iv) a request for consent to remove a tree set forth in a letter served by mail to said owner or resident; (v) a request for consent to remove a tree made during a meeting with said owner or resident on the affected property; or (vi) a request for consent to remove a tree served by email to said owner or resident. 
(b)  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude, prevent, or impair any property owner, resident, or the city from pursuing its legal remedies before the North Carolina Utilities Commission or from requesting the assistance of the Public Staff of the North Carolina Utilities Commission formally or informally at any time pursuant to the procedures set forth by those agencies. Formal complaints pertaining to a utility's vegetation management practices may be filed with the North Carolina Utilities Commission, addressed to the Chief Clerk, North Carolina Utilities Commission, 4325 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699-4325. Prior to filing a formal complaint with the North Carolina Utilities Commission, said party may request informal resolution of the issue through the involvement of the Consumer Services Division of the Public Staff of the North Carolina Utilities Commission. 
(Ord. No. 15436, § 2, 3-4-2019) 
Sec. 26-254. - Supervision and oversight of contractors. 
    Each utility shall be responsible for oversight of its contractors in the performance of all work and will ensure that contractors adhere to agreement provisions and proper vegetation maintenance practices. As part of the operational plan, the utility will identify a certified arborist for each project who will be involved in the oversight of the crews and serve as a primary contact to the city manager and owner or resident of occupied property. 
(Ord. No. 15436, § 2, 3-4-2019) 
Sec. 26-255. - Vegetation management clean-up. 
(1)  All debris from vegetation maintenance should be cleaned up each day, or within a reasonable amount of time, as described below, unless permission is given by the city manager or owner or resident of the occupied property to do otherwise. The clean-up required by this subsection includes the following: 
(a)  Impacted lawn areas shall be cleaned of debris. 
(b)  Impacted streets and sidewalks shall be cleaned of debris. 
(c)  Brush (having a diameter of 6 inches or less), branches and logs shall be dealt with as follows: 
(1)  In landscaped and maintained areas, brush should be chipped and removed from the site. When feasible and agreed to by the owner or resident of the occupied maintained property and the utility, chips may be blown into an area either within the right of way or adjacent to the right of way corridor. Larger wood, which belongs to the owner or resident of the occupied maintained property, should be cut into manageable lengths and stacked neatly at the base of the tree. In the case of wood or brush cut down from dead or dying trees, all wood regardless of diameter shall be stacked neatly at the base of the tree. There is no requirement that such brush be chipped due to safety concerns. 
(2)  In non-maintained areas, trees and limbs shall be cut, left on site, and windrowed along the edge of the right of way. At the utility's discretion, brush will either be chipped or mechanically processed when the site and terrain reasonably allows for it. If the terrain or ground conditions preclude the use of mechanized equipment, the debris may be manually windrowed and eitP.er loaded for off-site disposal or manually cut and left to bio-degrade naturally. 
(Ord. No. 15436, § 2, 3-4-2019) 
Sec. 26-256. - Vegetation management annual review. 
    Once each calendar year, the city manager will meet with each utility in order to review the tree pruning, trimming and cutting that had been conducted and to discuss each of the following: (i) the challenges and problems experienced by the City of Durham; (ii) the challenges and problems experienced by the utility; (iii) the successes experienced by the City of Durham; (iv) the successes experienced by the utility; and (v) what the City of Durham and the utility can try to do differently in an effort to enhance future communication, execution of future tree pruning and opportunities to continue to promote the enhancement of the urban tree canopy.

Sec. 30-81. - Findings. 
    The city council hereby finds and declares that: 
(1)  An adequate system of streets, parks and recreation facilities, and open space land is vital and necessary to the health, safety, welfare, and prosperity of the city and its citizens. Substantial growth and new construction has taken place in recent years and is anticipated to continue in the future. This causes and imposes increased, substantial demands upon, and needs for, city facilities and infrastructure, including the system of streets, parks and recreation facilities, and open space land, that would not otherwise exist. Meeting these demands and needs is very costly. However, failure to do so will result in an inadequate system of streets, parks and recreation facilities, and open space land. This would make the city a less desirable community and be detrimental to the health, safety, welfare, and prosperity of the city and its citizens. 
(2)  To the extent that future growth and new construction in the city places demand upon, and creates needs for, the city's system of streets, parks and recreation, and open space land, the demands and needs should be met by shifting a portion of the capital costs of providing streets, parks and recreation facilities, and open space land from the public at large to the new construction which creates, in whole or in part, these demands and needs. The impact fees prescribed by this article are equitable, do not impose an unfair or disproportionate burden on developers and new construction, and are in the best interests of the general welfare of the city and its citizens.

Sec. 30-84. - Computation of fees. 
(a)  The inspections department shall determine and collect all impact fees. The fees to be collected shall be determined at the time of building permit application.

Before a certificate of compliance is issued for any part of a building, the impact fees for the entire structure must be paid in full. The inspections department shall have the authority to determine the appropriate use category, using the definitions in this article, the definitions in the UDO, similarities between proposed uses and defined uses, historic patterns of traffic generation in the Durham community, and reasonable professional discretion. 
(b)  The impact fees shall be as set by the city council, as found in the fee schedule of the city. 
ALTERNATIVE STREET IMPACT FEE CALCULATION 
In the event that a feepayor believes that the attributable costs for improving the system of streets to serve the feepayor's new construction is less than the street impact fee schedule, the feepayor may submit an alternative fee calculation to the department of public works based upon the following: 
Impact fee = (PHT) × (DR) × (0.75 × Cost per trip end 1 ) 
    where 
PHT = the number of peak hour trips of the new construction, determined using the peak hour (AM or PM) that generates the highest number of trips 
DR = diversion ratio (1 - the percent of diverted trip). The diversion ratio is one for all uses except retail uses, and 
COST = the capital costs of providing streets, less: credits for existing street deficiencies, through-trip discount, NCDOT Transportation Improvement Plan contributions, double payment credits, and time differential adjustments. 2 For purposes of this calculation, it is the policy of the city to only charge 75 percent of the actual cost per trip end. 
    The department of public works shall determine in its discretion whether the above calculations are reasonable, giving consideration, among other things, to generally accepted professional practices and methodology, appropriateness and applicability of submitted data on peak hour trips, local conditions, and qualifications of professionals submitting the data. If the director of the department of public works determines that the calculations are reasonable, the director may authorize use of the alternative street impact fee for the new construction. The cost of performing the alternative fee calculation shall be borne by the feepayor. 
1 The cost per trip end for the south zone is $2,782.00. 
 The cost per trip end for the north service zone is $1,051.00. 
 The cost per trip end for the downtown service zone is $581.00. 
2 These credits and offsets to the calculation of costs are further explained in City of Durham Transportation Impact Fee Study Update, dated February 6, 2008. 
(c)  The inspections department shall calculate the amount of the applicable impact fees due for each structure by: 
(1)  Determining the applicable impact fee service zone; 
(2)  Verifying the type and number of residential dwelling units and the type of nonresidential new construction and square footage or other applicable measuring criteria for which each certificate of compliance is sought; 
(3)  Determining the applicable impact fee per unit or other measuring criteria set forth in the fee schedule or in subsection (b); and 
(4)  Multiplying the applicable impact fee per unit or other measuring criteria set forth in the fee schedule or in subsection (b) by: 
a.  The appropriate number of residential dwelling units (or, for hotel/motel, the number of rooms), or 
b.  The appropriate number of the measuring criteria for nonresidential new construction (e.g., parking spaces, square feet/1,000 acres, students). 
(d)  The inspections department shall take the following special cases into account when calculating the applicable impact fees. 
(1)  Alterations, expansions, or redevelopments. In the case of an alteration, expansion, renovation or redevelopment of an existing development, impact fees shall be levied based upon the net increase, if any, above that which the existing development would pay. 
(2)  Change of use or the addition of other uses. In the case of a change of use, such as residential to office, or the addition of other uses such as daycare to a church, which increase the fee rate or total fee above that which the existing use would pay, impact fees shall be paid based upon the net increase in the fee for the new use as compared to the previous use. There shall be no reimbursement of any impact fees due to a change of use which has a lower fee than the current use, nor shall there be any reimbursement if a use is terminated. 
(3)  Mixed use developments and buildings. In the case of mixed use developments, whether or not denominated "mixed use" in zoning, or a mixture of uses in buildings, or multiple tenants or unit owners, impact fees shall be based on individual uses, or, if the inspections director determines that is unfeasible or impractical, on the prevailing use, as determined in the discretion of the inspections director in light of traffic generation of the different uses. 
(4)  "Shell only" permits. In the case of a "shell only" permit, the impact fee amounts may be based on the use or uses used to determine the amount of required off-street parking or as shown on the building permit when no off-street parking is required. If it is found during review of the "up-fit" permit that the uses differ from those uses for the shell, a determination shall be made as to whether or not an additional fee or refund is due. Before the first tenant up-fit certificate of compliance is issued, the impact fees for the entire structure must be paid in full. 
(5)  Size of retail establishments. In the case of retail uses which share common drives or parking areas and which are eligible for the off-street parking requirements of the "stores, retail high volume" use classification contained in the UDO, all such retail uses, including those located on separate outparcels, shall pay a street impact fee based on the appropriate square footage range of all the retail uses located within the shopping center even if this is a greater fee than for any single retail use or other combinations of retail uses. 
(6)  Unscheduled activity. If the type of new construction activity is not specified on the street impact fee schedule, the inspections department shall use the street impact fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the street fee schedule. If the feepayor disagrees with the determination of the inspections department, then the feepayor shall use the alternate street impact fee calculation set forth in this chapter, with the cost per trip end as set forth in the alternative street impact fee calculation schedule. 
(7)  Incidental use. In the case where there is a part of a structure used that is accessory or customary to activity within the structure and that is used primarily by those occupying the structure, then the primary use of the structure shall prevail for the impact fee calculation. 
(8)  Vacant parcel with proof of former structure. In the case where a parcel is vacant but has had a structure on the parcel within five years of the effective date of this chapter [effective November 1, 1989], the inspections department shall consider the use of the former structure in calculating the impact fee upon proof of such structure as provided by the feepayor. Impact fees shall be paid upon the net increase in the fee for the new use as compared to the previous use. There shall be no reimbursement of any impact fees due to a change of use which has a lower fee than the former use. 
(9)  Change in impact fee schedule. In the event that the impact fee schedule is changed, the city will assess the impact fee based on the fee schedule in effect at the time the developer submits a completed building permit application in a form approvable by the city without further modification, including: 
a.  All necessary site plan submissions; 
b.  Architectural, electrical, mechanical and plumbing drawings; and 
c.  All other submissions to the city necessary to constitute a completed building permit application form. 
There shall be no reimbursement or recalculation of any impact fees due to a lower fee. 
(Code 1982, § 25-4; Ord. No. 12965, § 1, 6-21-2004; Ord. No. 13592, § 1, 5-5-2008) 
Sec. 30-85. - Funds collected. 
(a)  Creation of trust funds. The impact fees collected by the city pursuant to this article shall be kept separate from other revenue of the city in a manner consistent with the Local Government Budget and Fiscal Control Act. There shall be nine trust funds, one established for each Impact fee type by service zone. All impact fee funds collected shall be properly identified by the appropriate trust account. 
(b)  Limitation on expenditure of funds collected. 
(1)  Funds from impact fee trust accounts shall be expended for no other purpose than capital costs for streets, parks and recreation facilities, or open space. Capital costs specifically include the administrative and legal costs associated with assessing and collecting impact fees. One percent of all impact fees collected shall be retained by the city-county inspections department as an administrative fee ("administrative fee") to reimburse the city-county inspections department's expenses in assessing and collecting impact fees. After collection and disbursement of the administrative fee to the city-county inspections department, the remainder of the impact fee shall be deposited in the appropriate trust fund account. No funds shall be used for the performance of periodic or routine maintenance activities. 
(2)  All funds shall be used exclusively within the service zone from which the funds were collected. An annual report shall be made to the city council showing where the fees have been collected and what projects have been funded with impact fee monies. The council shall consider this report and whether within each service zone the fees are being spent for the benefit of new construction within the service zone. If the council determines that this is not the case, then it shall adjust the city's capital improvements program and other projected capital expenditures to correct this condition. 
(3)  Funds shall be expended in the order in which they were collected. Funds not obligated for expenditure within ten years after their collection may be returned to the feepayor, subject to subsection (e) of this section. 
(c)  Disbursal of funds. Funds withdrawn from these trust accounts must be used solely in accordance with the provisions of this section. Prior to withdrawal, the city council, upon recommendation of the city manager, shall make a finding as to the connection between new construction and the proposed use of funds. The motion for each project wholly or partially financed with impact fees shall read: 
"To find that (project name) is at least _______% necessitated by new construction and that up to _______% of the capital costs of that project may be paid by impact fees collected within the same service zone and collected for the same purpose." 
(d)  Interest on funds. Any funds on deposit not immediately necessary for expenditure shall be invested as allowed in G.S. 159-30 for other public monies. All income derived shall be deposited in the applicable trust account. 
(e)  Return of fees. If it is determined by the city that fee assessments collected pursuant to this article have not been spent or encumbered for expenditure by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following ten years from the date the fee was received, then said funds, minus the administrative fee, shall be eligible for refund to the then present owner in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The then present owner must petition the city manager for the refund within one year following the end of the calendar quarter immediately following ten years from the date on which the fee was received by the city. 
(2)  The petition must be submitted to the city manager and must contain: 
a.  A notarized sworn statement that the petitioner is the current owner of the development site; 
b.  A copy of the dated receipt issued for payment of the fee; 
c.  A certified copy of the latest recorded deed; 
d.  A copy of the most recent ad valorem tax bill; and 
e.  Such other information which may be reasonably necessary to ascertain current ownership of the development site. 
(3)  Within 60 days from the date of receipt of petition for refund, the city manager shall advise the petitioner of the status of the fee requested for refund. For the purpose of determining whether fees have been spent or encumbered, the first money placed in a trust fund account shall be deemed to be the first money taken out of that account when withdrawals have been made. 
(4)  When the money requested is still in the trust fund account and has not been spent or encumbered by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following ten years from the date the fees where paid, the money, minus the administrative fee, shall be returned with interest at the rate of four percent per annum. 
(Code 1982, § 25-5; Ord. No. 12965, § 1, 6-21-2004; Ord. No. 14120, 5-16-2011) 
Sec. 30-86. - Credits. 
(a)  Street impact fees. A feepayor shall be entitled to credits against street impact fees pursuant to this article for rights-of-way dedications, and street construction in excess of the direct need of the new development for streets that have been included in impact fee calculations. These include major and minor thoroughfares contained in the thoroughfare plan but do not include freeways, collectors, and local roads. The credits shall be determined by the department of public works as follows: 
(1)  Rights-of-way. Credits shall be granted for rights-of-way for eligible streets dedicated by the feepayor and accepted by the city in accordance with the following provisions: 
a.  Credits shall be based on a prorata share of the appraised land value of the parent parcel as determined by calculating 120 percent of the appraised value according to the county tax administrator's office. Adjustments to the appraised value of property between property revaluations by the county will be made annually based on cumulative changes in the Consumer Price Index since the most recent revaluation. 
b.  Credits shall be granted for dedication of right-of-way in excess of the standard 60-foot right-of-way for any eligible street the new construction accesses; provided, however, that there shall be no credit for right-of-way dedications necessary to install turn lanes that directly serve the new construction. 
c.  If a right-of-way is dedicated and accepted for an eligible street to which the new construction has no direct access, then the entire right-of-way will be included in the credit. 
(2)  Street construction. Credits shall be granted for street construction for portions of eligible streets in excess of the direct need of the new construction as determined by the department of public works in accordance with the following provisions: 
a.  Credits shall be based on the feepayor's actual cost of construction, not to exceed the city's cost of construction according to recent bid sheet information. 
b.  Credits shall be granted for construction of the portion of the street in excess of the standard 38 feet face to face of curb for streets that are directly accessed by the new construction; provided, however, that there shall be no credit for construction of turn lanes that directly serve the new construction. 
c.  All improvements to streets not directly accessed by the new construction are eligible for credits. 
d.  Credits may be granted for future street construction when the developer provides security to the city through an instrument such as a letter of credit or performance bond acceptable to the city. Each such security instrument shall be in a form and amount satisfactory to the city. The amount of any such letter or performance bond shall include the estimated cost of improvements and shall allow for administrative costs, inflation, and other contingencies. 
(3)  The cost of land or capital improvements for public transportation-related projects or participation in employee ridesharing, bus subsidy, or other traffic demand management programs to the extent that such programs reduce the external vehicular trip generation of the land use as confirmed by studies and methodologies acceptable to the city. In the case of employee ridesharing, bus subsidy, or other traffic demand management programs, the applicant must first describe, to the satisfaction of the city, the extent of the program and expected usage by employees. The city will collect the entire street impact fees due from the feepayor and set aside an amount equal to the street impact fee credit in reserve. If the owner of the property demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city that the traffic demand management program results in the anticipated automobile trip reduction within three years of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, then the feepayor will receive a rebate equal to the street impact fee credit or a lesser amount based on actual trip reduction. The provisions for awarding credits for land or capital improvements shall follow those provided in this section for right-of-way and street construction where applicable. 
(4)  Any feepayor seeking a credit against a street impact fee prescribed by this article shall submit a petition to the department of public works. To be eligible for consideration, the petition must be submitted within 180 days after the date the impact fee is paid pursuant to section 30-84(a) and must contain where appropriate: 
a.  A notarized sworn statement that the petitioner is the current owner of the property; 
b.  A copy of any documentation on which the feepayor relies for the claim which may pertain to the issuance of such credits; 
c.  A copy of the latest recorded deed to the property; 
d.  A description of land or improvements for which the credit is requested; 
e.  For new construction involving more than one building, a plan for allocating credits among the various buildings proposed; and 
f.  Such other information which may be reasonably necessary to ascertain current ownership of the property or otherwise enable the department of public works to evaluate the feepayor's petition. 
(5)  Credits shall be applied against the payment of street impact fees for the property being developed and shall not be transferable to other property. Credits may not be used for payment of any other charges or other impact fees due to the city. Credits may be transferred to subsequent owners of the property, and shall be valid for a period of ten years after being granted by the city. Calculation of the ten-year period shall be tolled, or suspended, during the time period January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 for any credit that exists during this time period. A subsequent owner to whom credits have been transferred shall submit the following to the department of public works prior to any use of such credits:

b.  A copy of any documentation on which the feepayor relies in support of the claim for the transfer of credits; 
c.  A copy of the latest recorded deed to the property; and 
d.  Such other information which may be reasonably necessary to ascertain current ownership of the property or otherwise enable the department of public works to evaluate the feepayor's claim pertaining to the transfer and use of credits. 
No payments or refunds shall be made by the city for credits granted to the feepayor which are not used within the ten-year period provided for in this subsection. 
(6)  Extensions to the time period for using credits may be granted by the city council, in incremental periods totaling not more than five years in exceptional circumstances where the delay of city completion of a major thoroughfare that was shown on the city's capital improvement plan at the time the credits were granted has delayed the credit-holder's ability to utilize its credits during the ten-year time period. Any extension must be applied for in writing prior to the expiration of the ten-year period. 
(b)  Parks and recreation impact fees. A feepayor shall be entitled to credits against parks and recreation impact fees pursuant to this article for the costs of parks and recreation facilities dedicated by the feepayor and accepted by the city. The credits shall be determined by the parks and recreation department in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  Park land. Credits shall be granted for park land dedicated by the feepayor and accepted by the city. Credits shall be based on a prorata share of the appraised land value of the parent parcel as determined by calculating 120 percent of the appraised value according to the county tax administrator's office. Adjustments to the appraised value of property between property revaluations by the county will be made annually based on cumulative changes in the Consumer Price Index since the most recent revaluation. 
(2)  Other parks and recreation facilities. Credits shall be granted for other parks and recreation facilities dedicated by the feepayor and accepted by the city. Credits shall be based on the feepayor's cost of construction based on invoices, bids and other documentation supplied by the feepayor. 
(3)  Any feepayor seeking a credit against a parks and recreation impact fee assessed shall submit a petition to the parks and recreation department. To be eligible for consideration, the petition must be submitted within 180 days after the date the impact fee is paid pursuant to section 30-84(a) and must contain where appropriate:

(4)  Credits shall be applied against the payment of parks and recreation impact fees for the property being developed and shall not be transferable to other property. Credits may not be used for payment of any charges or other impact fees due to the city. Credits may be transferred to subsequent owners of the property, and shall be valid for a period of ten years after being granted by the city. Calculation of the ten-year period shall be tolled, or suspended, during the time period January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 for any credit that exists during this time period. A subsequent owner to whom credits have been transferred shall submit the following to the city department of parks and recreation prior to any use of such credits: 
a.  A notarized sworn statement that the feepayor is the current owner of the property;

Sec. 30-87. - Appeals. 
(a)  After the amount of the impact fees or credits, if any, has been paid, a feepayor may, within ten days, file a written appeal contesting the amount of the impact fees or credits by requesting a conference with the city manager. If the feepayor, during the pendency of the appeal before the city, desires and is otherwise entitled to receive a certificate of compliance with respect to the new construction for which the amount of the impact fees or credits, if any, has been appealed, then the appealing party shall pay the impact fees with such payment clearly marked as paid under protest. The city manager shall notify the appealing party of the time and place for the conference. Failure of the appealing party, or representative thereof, to appear at the conference shall be considered an abandonment and withdrawal of the appeal. 
(b)  At the conference, the city manager shall consider any statements and evidence presented by the appealing party, and any information provided by the applicable city departments. The city manager shall then render a decision amending or confirming the amount of impact fees and credits, if any.

The notice shall also explain the basis for the staff's belief that the person to whom the notice is addressed is properly joined as a respondent. 
(d)  Within 30 days after the filing of the complaint, the staff shall commence an investigation of the complaint to ascertain the facts relating to the alleged unlawful discriminatory housing practice. If the complaint is not resolved before the investigation is completed, upon completion of the investigation, the staff shall determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that an unlawful discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur. The staff shall conclude its investigation and make a determination of reasonable cause within 100 days after the filing of the complaint.

(i)  If the director determines that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the director shall immediately issue a charge on behalf of the aggrieved person and shall notify the aggrieved person and the respondent of this determination by certified mail or personal service. Such charge: 
(1)  Shall consist of a short and plain statement of the facts upon which the director has found reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur; 
(2)  Shall be based on the final investigative report; and 
(3)  Need not be limited to the facts or grounds alleged in the complaint filed under subsection (a) of this section. 
(j)  Together with the service of the charge, the director shall provide the aggrieved person and the respondent with the following:

(b)  In conciliating a complaint, the director will attempt to achieve a just resolution of the complaint and to obtain assurances that the respondent will satisfactorily remedy any violations of the rights of the aggrieved person, and take such action as will assure the elimination of discriminatory housing practices, or the prevention of their occurrences, in the future. 
(c)  A conciliation agreement arising out of such conciliation shall be an agreement between the respondent and the complainant, and shall be subject to approval by the director. 
(d)  The terms of a settlement of a complaint will be reduced to a written conciliation agreement. The conciliation agreement shall seek to protect the interests of the aggrieved person, other persons similarly situated, and the public interest. Each conciliation agreement shall be made public unless the complainant and the respondent otherwise agree and the commission determines that disclosure is not required to further the purposes of this article. 
(e)  Nothing said or done in the course of conciliation under this article may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this article without the written consent of the persons concerned.

(b)  At a hearing under this section, each party may appear in person, be represented by counsel, present evidence, cross examine witnesses, and obtain the issuance of subpoenas under section 34-81.

(f)  If the hearing board finds that a respondent has engaged or is about to engage in a discriminatory housing practice, it shall promptly issue an order for such relief as may be appropriate, which may include actual damages suffered by the aggrieved person and injunctive or other equitable relief.

Qualified applicants will be placed on a waiting list in chronological order. 
(l)  If the number of taxicab operating permits requested exceeds the number of permits available, then the permits are issued to the most qualified applicants in order of priority. If certain applicants are equally qualified, then the order of priority shall be based upon the date and time of the application (earlier applicants with higher priority).

Sec. 50-471. - Revocation or non-renewal of permit; review of decisions. 
(a)  Revocation or non-renewal; grounds and procedure for revocation or non-renewal. The director may, (i) at any time, revoke any permit issued to a permittee or (ii) refuse to renew a permit issued to a permittee under this article and require that permittee remove its entire fleet of shared devices from city designated areas, if the director finds: 
(1)  Fraud, misrepresentation, or a knowingly false statement with respect to a material fact in the permit application or permit renewal application; 
(2)  The permittee or the permittee's agent or employee violated this article or the terms of the permit; 
(3)  The permittee's customers operate the shared devices in such a manner as to create unsafe traffic conditions, cause a breach of the peace or public nuisance, violate any applicable law, or interfere with the rights of property owners abutting the right-of-way, and such operation is done to such an extent that the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens or their property is at substantial risk if the permit is allowed to continue in effect; 
Except in case of emergency or impracticality, before revoking the permit or denying renewal of a permit, the director shall give reasonable notice to the permittee and an opportunity to be heard. A permit may be revoked or permit renewal denied pursuant to this section even if the person making the findings pursuant to this section had made a contrary finding before the permit was issued or renewed, regardless of whether the facts upon which the finding is made had changed. 
(b)  Notice. 
(i)  The director shall cause a written notice of the revocation or denial of renewal to be served on the permittee by first-class mail, email or other electronic means, or fax, to the address or number shown on the permit application, or by any method allowed by law for service of a summons in a civil action. The person serving the notice may be any person who is 18 years or older, including the director. 
(ii)  If the director finds that time before a proposed hearing is insufficient to allow service in accordance with subsection (i), the director may, as an alternative to the means listed in subsection (i), notify the permittee by telephone of the grounds for revocation or denial of renewal and of the right to appeal, provided a written notice is also sent in accordance with subsection (i) on or before the next day that is not a holiday. 
(iii)  The notice described in subsection (i) shall set forth a brief statement of the grounds for revocation or denial of renewal and of the right to appeal. 
(iv)  The director shall see that a written record is made to show: compliance with this section (b). 
(c)  Retention of fees; waiting period. If the city revokes a permit, the city shall retain the fee, if any, paid for the permit. In the case of a denial of a permit renewal, the city shall either not accept the renewal fee or return the renewal fee to the permittee. The person whose permit is revoked or renewal denied for grounds stated in subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3), regardless of whether additional grounds existed, shall not be issued a permit under the same section of this article for the remainder of the time for which the revoked permit had been issued or, in the case of a denial of a permit renewal, for the term of the renewal period. The director shall use reasonable judgment in deciding whether two applicants are the same so that, for example, technical changes in the applicant, or where the applicant one year is a corporation and the next year it is an affiliate or subsidiary of the same corporation, may be disregarded. 
(d)  Review of decisions. If the director denies the issuance of a permit, revokes a permit, denies renewal of a permit, issues a permit with terms deemed unacceptable to the permittee, or makes any other decision pursuant to this article with respect to a permit, the applicant or permittee may have that decision reviewed by filing a written request in the office of the director within ten days of the date of the notice of decision. The director or a person designated by the city manager for this purpose who is neither the person who made the decision complained of nor that person's subordinate, shall be named as the hearing officer to conduct a hearing in order to review the decision. The director shall cause a written notice of the time and place of the hearing to be given or sent to the person seeking review. The failure of the hearing officer to set a hearing within 15 days of the filing of the written request for review, or to deliver a decision within ten days after the hearing, or within any shortened periods set by the director, shall be deemed a denial of the relief sought and affirmance of the action for which review was sought. The permittee and the director may appear in person or through counsel and may present evidence, provided, however, that the hearing officer shall have the authority to conduct the hearing in the manner and for the period of time that he or she deems appropriate to make a decision. The hearing officer may affirm, deny, or modify the decision complained of, and the hearing officer's decision shall be final. Failure to request a review within the time and in the manner provided for in this subsection shall constitute a waiver of the right of review. The permit may be used during the review process only if the director determines that its use would not constitute a substantial threat that the grounds described in subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) will occur, re-occur, or continue during the review process. 
(e)  Certiorari. A decision by the hearing officer is subject to review by the Durham County Superior Court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. The petition for review shall be filed with the clerk of Superior Court within the earlier of 30 days after the denial and affirmance are deemed to occur pursuant to subsection (d), or within 30 days after the decision is delivered to the applicant. Delivery is made by hand-delivery of the decision to the applicant, or by first-class or certified mail to the address provided on the application. Delivery by mail is complete when placed in the custody of the U.S. Postal Service. 
(Ord. No. 15380, § 3, 10-15-2018) 
Sec. 50-472. - Penalties for violations. 
(a)  Assessment of civil penalties. The director shall assess civil penalties for violation of this article, including the terms of a permit. The director shall give the offender written notice of the nature of the violation and the amount of the civil penalty. The notice shall be served by any method allowed by law for service of a summons in a civil action, provided that the person delivering the notice may be any person who is 18 years or older, including the director. The civil penalty shall be $200.00 per violation plus the costs incurred by the city resulting from the violation, including costs of removing shared devices from the right-of-way. 
(b)  Review of assessment of civil penalties. Any person who has been assessed a civil penalty under this article may have that assessment reviewed by filing a written request in the office of the director within ten days of the date of service of the notice of the civil penalty. A person designated by the city manager for this purpose who is neither the person who assessed the civil penalty nor that person's subordinate shall be named as the hearing officer to conduct a hearing in order to review the assessment. The director shall cause a written notice of the time and place of the hearing to be given or sent to the person seeking review. The person assessed the penalty and the director may appear in person or through counsel and may present evidence, provided, however, that the hearing officer shall have the authority to conduct the hearing in the manner and for the period of time that he or she deems appropriate to make a decision. The hearing officer may affirm, deny, or modify the decision complained of, and the hearing officer's decision shall be final. Failure to request review within the time and in the manner provided for in this subsection constitutes a waiver of the right of review. 
(c)  Collection of civil penalties. If the offender does not pay the civil penalty within ten days after having been served with the notice of the civil penalty, the director may collect the civil penalties by causing to be commenced civil actions in the nature of debt. The director may compromise such claims, before or after commencement of the civil action, if the director finds there is a reasonable probability that the city will be unable to collect the entire amount of the claim, that the amount offered in compromise of the claim reasonably reflects either the amount of money available from the offender or the amount the city is likely to recover in the civil action, taking into account the resources required to pursue the civil action, and that the facts and circumstances of the events giving rise to the claim, taken as a whole, indicate that the amount offered in compromise is fair and reasonable. Using the foregoing standards, in an appropriate case, the director may abandon a claim. 
(d)  Criminal remedies. Except for provisions, if any, of this article that regulate the operation of shared devices, each violation of this article, including the terms of a permit, is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of $500.00. 
(e)  Available remedies. This article and the provisions of permits issued under this article may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy, including abatement orders and mandatory or prohibitory injunctions, issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. The general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application of the city for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law. In applying City Code section 1-9(e), the city council intends that revocation of a permit be deemed to be a remedy among other authorized remedies.

    All individuals conducting any activity for which a permit is required under this article and all permittees shall (1) immediately show the permit upon request of the city manager or any sworn law enforcement officer, and (2) prominently display the permit at all times while conducting any activity for which a permit is required under this article so that the permit is easily seen and not covered and so that the text of the permit can be read by the public without their having to ask to see it. The city manager may amend an already-issued permit to impose, as additional conditions of the permit, additional requirements respecting the posting of permits. Those amendments shall be effective on the fourth day after the notice of amendment is mailed to the permittee's address as stated in the permit application. 
(Code 1982, § 17-101; Ord. No. 12730, § 1, 12-9-2002; Ord. No. 14355, § 9, 11-5-2012) 
Sec. 54-141. - Termination and revocation of permit; review of decisions. 
(a)  Termination; grounds and procedure for revocation. The city manager may, at any time, terminate any permit issued under this article and any special-event permit referred to in this article, excluding permits issued pursuant to section 66-430 and excluding permits issued solely to allow First Amendment protected sales, for reasons satisfactory to the city manager. In addition, the city manager may revoke any permit issued under this article and any special-event permit referred to in this article, excluding permits issued pursuant to section 66-430, if: 
(1)  The city manager finds fraud, misrepresentation, or knowingly false statement with respect to a material fact in the permit application; 
(2)  The city manager finds that the permittee or the permittee's agent or employee violated this article or the terms of the permit; 
(3)  The city manager finds that the permittee or the petmittee's agent or employee conducted an activity for which the permit is required in such a manner as to create a public nuisance, cause of a breach of the peace, violate any applicable law, or interfere with the rights of abutting property owners. 
Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this section, the city manager may revoke a permit issued under section 54-110 upon finding that the public safety or the convenience of pedestrians is not served by the permit, and the city manager may revoke a permit issued under this article solely to allow First Amendment protected sales upon finding that the public safety is not served by the permit. 
    Except in case of emergency, before making the decision to terminate or revoke, the city manager shall give reasonable notice to the permittee and an opportunity to be heard. A permit may be revoked pursuant to this section even if the person making the findings pursuant to this section (the city manager or chief of police, as applicable) had made a contrary finding before the permit was issued, regardless of whether the facts upon which the finding is made had changed. 
(b)  Notice. The city manager shall cause a written notice of the revocation to be served on the permittee by first-class mail to the address shown on the permit application or by any method allowed by law for service of a summons in a civil action, provided that the person delivering the notice may be any person who is 18 years or older, including the city manager. The notice shall set forth a brief statement of the grounds for revocation and of the right to appeal. 
(c)  Retention of fees; waiting period. If the city revokes a permit, the city shall retain the fee paid for the permit. The person whose permit is revoked for grounds stated in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2), regardless of whether additional grounds existed, shall not be issued a permit under the same section of this article for the remainder of the time for which the revoked permit had been issued or 30 days after the date of the revocation, whichever time period is longer. The city manager shall use reasonable judgment in deciding whether two applicants are the same so that, for example, technical changes in the applicant, or where the applicant one year is the wife and the next year it is the husband, may be disregarded. 
(d)  Review of decisions. If the city manager denies the issuance of a permit, revokes a permit, issues a permit with terms deemed unacceptable to the permittee, or makes any other decision pursuant to this article with respect to a permit, the applicant or permittee may have that decision reviewed by filing a written request in the office of the city manager within ten days of the date of the notice of decision. The city manager or a person designated by the city manager for this purpose who is neither the person who made the decision complained of nor that person's subordinate, shall be named as the hearing officer to conduct a hearing in order to review the decision. The city manager shall cause a written notice of the time and place of the hearing to be given or sent to the person seeking review. The permittee and the city manager may appear in person or through counsel and may present evidence, provided, however, that the hearing officer shall have the authority to conduct the hearing in the manner and for the period of time that he or she deems appropriate to make a decision. The hearing officer may affirm, deny, or modify the decision complained of, and the hearing officer's decision shall be final. Failure to request a review within the time and in the manner provided for in this subsection shall constitute a waiver of the right of review. The permit may be used during the review process only if the city manager determines that its use would not constitute a substantial threat that the grounds described in subsection (a)(2), (a)(3), or (a)(4) will occur, re-occur, or continue during the review process.

DIVISION 5. - OTHER PROVISIONS 

Sec. 54-188. - Penalties for violations. 
(a)  Assessment of civil penalties. The city manager shall assess civil penalties for violation of this article, including the terms of a permit. The city manager shall give the offender written notice of the nature of the violation and the amount of the civil penalty. The notice shall be served by any method allowed by law for service of a summons in a civil action, provided that the person delivering the notice may be any person who is 18 years or older, including the city manager. The civil penalty shall be $200.00 per violation plus the costs incurred by the city resulting from the violation, including costs of removing litter. 
(b)  Review of assessment of civil penalties. Any person who has been assessed a civil penalty under this article may have that assessment reviewed by filing a written request in the office of the city manager within ten days of the date of service of the notice of the civil penalty. A person designated by the city manager for this purpose who is neither the person who assessed the civil penalty nor that person's subordinate shall be named as the hearing officer to conduct a hearing in order to review the assessment. The city manager shall cause a written notice of the time and place of the hearing to be given or sent to the person seeking review. The person assessed the penalty and the city manager may appear in person or through counsel and may present evidence, provided, however, that the hearing officer shall have the authority to conduct the hearing in the manner and for the period of time that he or she deems appropriate to make a decision. The hearing officer may affirm, deny, or modify the decision complained of, and the hearing officer's decision shall be final. Failure to request a review within the time and in the manner provided for in this subsection constitutes a waiver of the right of review. 
(c)  Collection of civil penalties. If the offender does not pay the civil penalty within ten days after having been served with the notice of the civil penalty, the city manager may collect the civil penalties by causing to be commenced civil actions in the nature of debt. The city manager may compromise such claims, before or after commencement of the civil action, if the city manager finds there is a reasonable probability that the city will be unable to collect the entire amount of the claim, that the amount offered in compromise of the claim reasonably reflects either the amount of money available from the offender or the amount the city is likely to recover in the civil action, taking into account the resources required to pursue the civil action, and that the facts and circumstances of the events giving rise to the claim, taken as a whole, indicate that the amount offered in compromise is fair and reasonable. Using the foregoing standards, in an appropriate case, the city manager may abandon a claim. 
(d)  Criminal remedies. Except for provisions, if any, of this article that regulate the operation or parking of motor vehicles, each violation of this article, including the terms of a permit, is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of $500.00. 
(e)  Reserved. 
(f)  Available remedies. This article and the provisions of permits issued under this article may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy, including abatement orders and mandatory or prohibitory injunctions, issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. The general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application of the city for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law. In applying subsection 1-9(e), the city council intends that termination and revocation of a permit be considered to be remedies. 
(Code 1982, § 17-109; Ord. No. 12730, § 1, 12-9-2002; Ord. No. 14355, § 9, 11-5-2012; Ord. No. 14845, § 5, 10-19-2015) 
Sec. 54-189. - Privilege license ordinance not affected; refund of privilege tax.

Sec. 54-190. - Cumulative requirements. 
    No provisions of the City Code, except those explicitly repealed or explicitly amended by the ordinance adopting this article, are repealed by this article. If any provision of this article allows an activity to occur but another provision of the City Code regulates or prohibits it, the more restrictive provision applies. 
(Code 1982, § 17-112; Ord. No. 12730, § 1, 12-9-2002; Ord. No. 14355, § 9, 11-5-2012) 
Sec. 54-191. - Reservation of rights in city; other ordinances and N.C. DOT not limited. 
(a)  To the extent directed by the city, any person allowed to do any activity by this article or by a permit issued under this article shall promptly cease the activity and remove all property that the city deems to interfere with the purposes for which the direction is given. The city reserves the right to require any activity allowed by this article or by a permit issued under this article to cease in whole or in part, for any purpose, including:

Upon receiving such order, the seller or salesperson shall comply. When such an order is not complied with (including because the seller or salesperson is not readily found), the city manager may cause objects in violation of the order to be removed, disposed of, or both, and the cost of such actions shall be borne by the offender. This subsection shall not be construed to limit subsection (a). 
(d)  Nothing in this division shall be construed to limit any other ordinance, including section 38-22 (parking in city parks), section 66-108 (driving over curbs, gutters or sidewalks at places other than those constructed and designed for traffic), section 66-109 (driving on sidewalk), section 66-116 (operation in public parks), and those imposing parking restrictions. Nothing in this division shall be construed to limit the authority of the N.C. Department of Transportation over rights-of-way under its jurisdiction.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 14355, § 9, adopted November 5, 2012, changed the title of section 54-191 from "Reservation of rights" to "Reservation of rights in city; other ordinances and N.C. DOT not limited." The historical notation has been preserved for reference purposes. 
Sec. 54-192. - Severability. 
    By way of example in applying section 1-8, if this article is invalid as to a particular portion of a street right-of-way, it shall still be valid as to the remaining street right-of-way. This section shall not be construed to limit section 1-8.

Should the director determine that the garbage collection service rendered under a waiver is inadequate, he or she will revoke the waiver by giving the owner written notice 30 days in advance of the effective date of such revocation. Upon such revocation, the owner shall comply with the other sections of this division as if no waiver had ever been granted. 
(c)  Any person who is dissatisfied with any ruling or order of the director may appeal to the city council, which is hereby designated as the appeal board, and the city council may sustain or reverse the action, or modify same or remand for further hearing; provided, that any such appeal shall be in writing and signed by the owner of the property as to which the appeal is taken, or by his or her attorney, stating in a considered manner the grounds upon which the appeal is based, and filed with the city clerk not later than ten days after the rendition of the decision or order appealed.

In the case of a loop or circular street, where the street has only one street intersection, the two edges of the street can be thought of as two concentric circles; the shorter, inside edge abuts one block face, and the longer, outside edge abuts the second block face. In the case of a cul-de-sac, block face means all the lots abutting the street. 
    Controlled parking residential area or CPRA means the on-street parking spaces designated as a CPRA, in which the spaces abut at least two or more residential block faces in which on-street parking of motor vehicles: 
(1)  Is restricted pursuant to this division; or 
(2)  Pursuant to a section of this Code outside this division, is subject to time limits or is prohibited. 
    Permit is a license that exempts a motor vehicle on which the permit is displayed in accordance with this division from the two-hour restriction on parking imposed by section 66-260. 
    Residential means residential in character or use. 
    Residential area means a portion of the city that is primarily residential. 
    Residential block face means a continuous portion of a block face, which continuous portion is primarily residential. 
(Ord. No. 14811, § 1, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 66-255. - Purpose. 
    In order to reduce hazardous traffic conditions resulting from the parking of motor vehicles in residential areas by persons visiting or working at nearby commercial, industrial or institutional facilities; to protect residential areas from polluted air, excessive noise, trash and refuse caused by the entry of such vehicles; to protect the individuals living in residential areas from unreasonable obstacles in access to their residences; to preserve the character of residential areas as residential areas; to promote efficiency in maintaining residential streets in a clean and safe condition; to preserve residential property values; and to preserve the safety of children, pedestrians and occupants of motor vehicles, and the peace, good order, comfort, convenience and welfare of the residents of the city generally and of the residents of residential areas in particular; it is necessary to restrict the flow of traffic from commercial, industrial or institutional facilities or uses into nearby residential areas for parking purposes. 
(Ord. No. 14811, § 1, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 66-256. - Findings. 
    Restricting traffic from commercial, industrial or institutional districts or uses from entering residential areas for parking purposes will: 
(1)  Reduce air pollution and other detrimental environmental effects; 
(2)  Assure convenient access and parking to individuals living in residential areas, and especially those who may wish to leave their cars at home; and 
(3)  Enhance the quality of life in residential areas by reducing noise, traffic hazards and litter. 
(Ord. No. 14811, § 1, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 66-257. - Determination of CPRAs. 
(a)  Initiation of study. On the initiative of the city manager, or when an individual who desires that a CPRA be designated on the street where he or she resides submits a letter of interest, the city manager may conduct a study pursuant to subsection (b). The letter of interest must indicate the nature of the problem and be in a format, and contain other information, as the city manager specifies. 
(b)  Studies. The study shall consider: 
(1)  The effect on the safety of residents of the block faces abutting the proposed CPRA from the parking and use of motor vehicles by nonresidents of those block faces; 
(2)  The need of the residents to obtain on-street parking near their places of residence, and the need of visitors to obtain adequate on-street parking near the places of residence they visit; 
(3)  The difficulty of residents to obtain on-street parking near their places of residence because of the widespread use of parking spaces in that area by nonresidents, and the difficulty of visitors to obtain adequate on-street parking near the places of residence they visit in the residential block faces under consideration because of the widespread use of parking spaces in that area by nonresidents who are not visiting places of residence there; 
(4)  The impact of major facilities and programs on the health, safety, and welfare of the residents and any unreasonable burdens placed on those residents in securing on-street parking and gaining access to their places of residence by virtue of such facilities and programs; 
(5)  The likelihood that designating a CPRA may alleviate the nonavailability of parking spaces for residents and their visitors; 
(6)  The fact that the streets in the residential block faces under consideration were constructed or improved by the city within the past five years (preceding the initiation of the study) and that the property owners of the lots abutting the residential block faces under consideration have been assessed all or some of the cost of the street construction or improvement; and 
(7)  The need for some parking spaces to be available in the area for use by nonresidents. 
(c)  Criteria for consideration. If the city manager determines, based on the results of the study, that all or a portion of the study area would benefit from the designation of a CPRA, the city manager shall determine whether these criteria are met: 
(1)  At least 70 percent of the legal on-street parking capacity of the residential block faces of the proposed CPRA must be occupied by parking or standing motor vehicles at any one time during the proposed restricted period. For the purpose of this subsection, a legal parking space is 21 feet in length except where a different length is in effect, and the restricted period shall comprise either (i) 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays or (ii) 6:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. seven days each week, in order to address parking during weekday business hours or during evening and night-time entertainment hours, respectively. 
(2)  At least 25 percent of the motor vehicles parked or standing in the proposed CPRA are registered in the names of persons who do not live in residences of lots abutting the proposed CPRA. 
(3)  The designations of CPRAs shall be codified by entries in an official map book, under category 2 (controlled parking residential areas, pursuant to section 66-254 et seq.). The maps themselves and amendments that may be made to them will not otherwise be placed in the city code. 
(d)  Petition for CPRA. If, after conducting a study pursuant to subsection (b) and determining the existence of the criteria listed in subsection (c), the city manager finds it is in the best interest of the city to designate a CPRA, the city manager shall solicit and receive a petition requesting the CPRA designation signed by an owner or an adult resident of a dwelling unit on a majority of the lots abutting the proposed CPRA. The city manager shall determine the sufficiency of each petition, and any insufficient petition shall be returned to the individual submitting it, with instructions for correction of deficiencies. For purposes of the petition, either spouse may sign as an owner when the dwelling unit is owned by tenants by the entireties. 
(e)  Designation of initial and additional CPRAs. If the city manager receives a petition for the CPRA pursuant to subsection (d), the city council may designate the area a CPRA. 
(1)  Additional designation by city council. Without requiring a study or requiring that the criteria in subsection (c) be met, the city council may designate as a CPRA, any on-street parking spaces abutting additional residential block faces near an existing CPRA where there is a substantial likelihood that persons going to nearby commercial, industrial or institutional facilities will begin to park motor vehicles in on-street parking spaces abutting residential block faces near the existing CPRA and thereby substantially contradict the purpose of this division as set forth in section 66-255. 
(2)  Additional designation by city manager. At any time after the designation of a CPRA by the city council, the city manager may designate additional on-street parking spaces abutting residential block faces near the CPRA without requiring a study, so long as (i) the additional CPRA meets the criteria in subsection (c), (ii) the cause of meeting those criteria (in terms of times of the day and days of the week) is the same cause for the designation by the city council, and (iii) the cumulative linear feet of on-street parking spaces added under this subsection do not exceed 20 percent of the total linear feet of the on-street parking spaces in the original CPRA. Such additional designations are deemed routine determinations pursuant to section 54.1 of the Charter. 
(f)  Posting of signs. The city manager shall post signs in the CPRA as needed to enforce this division. 
(g)  Permits. 
(1)  Annual permit. A resident of a lot abutting a CPRA is eligible to receive a permit for each motor vehicle that is primarily operated by him or her or that is registered in his or her name on the records of the state division of motor vehicles. As part of the application process, the resident must present the motor vehicle registration card for each motor vehicle for which a permit is desired and other information required by the city manager pursuant to section 1-11(b), (c). Permits issued under this subsection shall be issued for a period commencing at 12:01 a.m. January 1, and expiring at midnight, December 31. 
(2)  Visitor's permit. Upon submitting an application prepared pursuant to section 1-11(b), (c), any resident of a lot abutting a CPRA may obtain a temporary permit to be used by visitors to the resident's home; the permit shall be valid for the period specified in the permit, to a maximum of one week. If the visitor of a resident of a lot abutting a CPRA is visiting for more than one week, a visitor's permit may be issued for each week of the visit. 
(3)  Special permit. A special permit may be issued to nonresidents of lots abutting a CPRA upon submitting an application prepared pursuant to section 1-11(b), (c), and a finding by the city manager that good cause exists, consistent with the purposes of this division. Good cause includes employment on a lot abutting the CPRA and use of a rental vehicle. Permits issued under this subsection shall be valid for the period specified in the permit, up to 12 months. 
(4)  Permit contents and display. The permit shall bear, in addition to other information deemed appropriate by the city manager, a unique permit identification number, the CPRA in which it shall be valid and an expiration date. If the city manager chooses to issue the permit in the form of a decal, it shall be attached to the left rear window of the motor vehicle for which issued. If the city manager chooses to issue the permit in another form, the city manager shall specify on the permit how and where the permit must be displayed. 
(5)  Restrictions; reissuance of permit. 
a.  No person shall materially falsely represent himself or herself as eligible for a permit or furnish any materially false information in an application in order to obtain a permit. 
b.  Permits and decals are not transferrable; provided, however, that a holder of a permit who sells, trades or retires a motor vehicle may obtain a replacement permit by providing proof of eligibility for the permit under subsection (g)(1). 
c.  Lost, stolen or destroyed permits may be reissued, if the permit holder supplies proof of eligibility for the permit under subsection (g)(1). 
(Ord. No. 14811, § 1, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 66-258. - Enforcement; exemptions. 
(a)  Enforcement of restrictions imposed by a sign to be posted pursuant to section 66-257(e) shall not begin until 30 days after the sign has been posted. Replacement signs are effective immediately. A permit will not guarantee the holder a parking place; provide an exemption from any ordinances governing parking on city streets; or limit the city's authority to revoke any or all permits or to revise or repeal this division. 
(b)  Motor vehicles driven by the following persons while engaged in the performance of their respective occupations are exempt from this division: 
(1)  Persons authorized by a governmental person, as defined by section 1-2, including the city; 
(2)  Firefighting personnel, law enforcement personnel, EMS personnel, health care workers or providers, military personnel, civil preparedness personnel, emergency management personnel, and emergency management workers (defined by G.S. 166A-19.60(e)); or 
(3)  Persons providing services to owners or residents of lots abutting a CPRA when the motor vehicle is conspicuously marked on the exterior to indicate a business or service. 
(Ord. No. 14811, § 1, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 66-259. - Revocation of permit. 
(a)  The city manager may revoke the permit of any holder found to be in violation of this division, and, upon written notification thereof, the holder shall have ten days in which to file a notice of appeal or surrender the permit. Notice by mail is deemed given by the mailing of first-class mail addressed to the address on the application submitted to the city to request the permit. An appeal is deemed filed or permit surrendered when it is received by the city manager. 
(b)  Notice of appeal shall be in writing and filed in the office of the city manager. The city manager shall schedule a hearing on the matter within 30 days after the notice of appeal is filed. The decision of the city manager shall be final. 
(c)  Failure to file an appeal as provided for in this section waives the right to appeal. 
(d)  Revoking a permit does not limit other remedies for violation of this division. 
(Ord. No. 14811, § 1, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 66-260. - Violations and penalties. 
    Except to the extent otherwise provided in section 66-258, no person shall park a motor vehicle in a CPRA for longer than two hours without a properly displayed permit or obtain or use a permit in a manner contrary to this division. Any person found in violation of this division shall be assessed a civil penalty as provided in section 66-370(c) and, to the extent applicable, section 1-9(b). 
(Ord. No. 14811, § 1, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 66-261. - Restrictions and penalties generally cumulative. 
    Nothing in this division limits prohibitions and restrictions that are imposed by any section of this Code outside this division on the use of an on-street parking space in a CPRA. However, section 66-260 does not apply to a space where parking is prohibited at all times. Penalties for violation of this division and for violation of restrictions imposed by any section of this Code outside this division are cumulative.

Sec. 66-265. - Definitions. 
    In this division, the following definitions apply unless the context clearly requires otherwise. 
    Contractor parking permit means a permit issued pursuant to section 66-267. 
    Law means law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or decree or order of any governmental entity. 
    On-street parking space means a space designated by the city or the state for parking a motor vehicle on a street right-of-way. 
    On-street parking space permit means a permit issued pursuant to section 66-270. 
    Permit depending on the context, refers to any or all of the permits issued under this division. 
    Street right-of-way means the entire area in which the public, the city, or the state owns a property interest, when a portion is open to the use of the public as a matter of right for any motor vehicle traffic. The street right-of-way includes roadway, and may include right-of-way parking area, sidewalk, median, and unpaved areas, including grassed area. 
    Temporary construction space means a portion of the street right-of-way, including on-street parking spaces, for which the city manager makes findings listed in section 66-267. The space may include an area contiguous with an on-street parking space. 
    Time-limited parking space means an on-street parking space in which parking a motor vehicle is lawful for a specified period that is less than 24 hours. It includes on-street parking spaces in which parking is limited by section 66-260 or by time zone parking restrictions that are adopted pursuant to section 66-345 and entered on traffic schedule (5)f. under that section. Loading and unloading spaces are not time-limited parking spaces. 
(Ord. No. 14809, § 2, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 66-266. - Scope. 
    This division applies only to the streets marked on the map labeled "On-Street Parking Program" and "Map prepared by Durham GIS on 5/7/2015." Pursuant to section 66-345 the map shall be codified by entry in an official map book, under category 1 (streets subject to temporary use of street rights-of-way by contractors and parking for extended periods in limited time zone parking spaces, pursuant to section 66-265 et seq.). The map itself and amendments that may be made to it will not otherwise be placed in the city code. 
(Ord. No. 14809, § 2, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 66-267. - Contractor parking permit. 
    The city manager may issue a contractor parking permit to allow the occupation of a temporary construction space by vehicles, fences, receptacles for solid waste, and other apparatus, supplies, material, and equipment, provided that the occupation of the space is connected with construction, maintenance, repair, servicing, or demolition, or for loading or unloading, or for moving. The city manager shall not issue a permit without finding that occupation of the space in accordance with the terms of the permit (i) is reasonably necessary for the project, (ii) can be done without interfering with the regular flow of motor vehicle traffic, and (iii) can be done without endangering or unduly inconveniencing persons or endangering property. Fees for permits shall be as set by the city council from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 14809, § 2, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 66-268. - Terms of permit. 
    The city manager shall specify in each permit any conditions that the city manager deems appropriate for the situation, including requiring the permittee to post and maintain signs, barricades, fencing, cones, lights, and other boundary or safety devices. The space shall be located where the city manager designates. On-street parking spaces may be included within the boundaries of the temporary construction space. The permit shall designate the boundaries of the space and may include vertical limitations. The permit shall expire when specified in the permit but in no event may a single permit remain effective longer than six months, provided that a new permit may be issued to continue after an existing permit expires, if the city manager finds that to be appropriate under section 66-267. Nothing in the permit shall be deemed to relieve the permittee from complying with applicable law or from complying with the appropriate standard of care. Complying with the permit is intended only to constitute a defense to a citation for violating limited time zone parking restrictions that are adopted pursuant to section 66-345 and entered on traffic schedule (5)f. under that section, and not a defense to violation of other applicable law or the appropriate standard of care. 
(Ord. No. 14809, § 2, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 66-269. - Placing objects in parking spaces other than motor vehicles and sales gear. 
    No object other than a motor vehicle shall be placed in a space designated by the city or the state for parking a motor vehicle on a street unless an individual remains in or near the space and immediately removes the object from the space upon an indication that another individual intends to move a motor vehicle into the space. This section does not affect the placement of sales gear allowed by section 54-91(b). The violation of this section shall subject the offender to a civil penalty to be recovered by the city in a civil action in the nature of debt if the offender, or the registered owner of the object, does not pay the penalty within ten days of the violation. The violation shall not be deemed criminal and no criminal penalty shall be imposed therefor. 
(Ord. No. 14809, § 2, 6-15-2015; Ord. No. 15000, § 4, 9-6-2016) 
Sec. 66-270. - On-street parking space permits. 
(a)  Standard permits. The city manager may issue on-street parking space permits to allow a vehicle to be parked in a time-limited parking space without regard to the time limit, when the city manager determines such parking is needed for construction, maintenance, repair, servicing, demolition, loading, unloading, or moving. The permit shall designate one or more parking spaces where the permit applies. The permit shall expire when specified in the permit but in no event may a single permit remain effective longer than six months, provided that a new permit may be issued to continue after an existing permit expires, if the city manager finds that to be appropriate under the standards of this section. Fees for permits shall be as set by the city council from time to time. 
(b)  Permits for utilities. The city manager may issue on-street parking space permits to allow a vehicle to be parked in a time-limited parking space without regard to the time limit, for vehicles operated by or for companies that have the right to place wires, cables, or pipes in the street right-of-way pursuant to a franchise ordinance or an easement from the city or the state, but only for the time period when the vehicle is used for construction, maintenance, or repair. The permit may, but need not, designate one or more specific parking spaces where the permit applies. If the permit provides for its expiration upon the passage of time or by some other measure, it expires accordingly, provided that a new permit may be issued to continue after an existing permit expires, if the city manager finds that to be appropriate under the standards of this section. Fees for permits shall be as set by the city council from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 14809, § 2, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 66-271. - Exemptions from limited time zone parking restrictions.

(Ord. No. 14809, § 2, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 66-272. - Suspension, termination, and revocation of permit; review of decisions. 
(a)  Suspension, termination, and revocation. The city manager may, at any time, suspend or terminate a permit for reasons satisfactory to the city manager. Without limiting the preceding sentence, the city manager may suspend or terminate a permit: 
(1)  To allow for construction, maintenance, or repair of any street, sidewalk, utility, building, or facility; 
(2)  To allow for use of a public street, sidewalk, utility, building, or facility in connection with parades, festivals, or other events; 
(3)  To remedy a nuisance; or 
(4)  To protect or promote the public health, safety, or welfare. 
(b)  Revocation. The city manager may revoke a permit if: 
(1)  The city manager finds fraud, misrepresentation, or knowingly false statement with respect to a material fact in the permit application; 
(2)  The city manager finds that the permittee or the permittee's agent or employee violated this division or the terms of the permit; 
(3)  The city manager finds that the permittee or the permittee's agent or employee conducted an activity for which the permit is required in such a manner as to create a public nuisance, cause of a breach of the peace, violate any applicable law, or interfere with the rights of abutting property owners; or 
(4)  The city manager finds that the public safety or convenience of pedestrians is not served by the permit. 
Except in case of emergency or insufficient time, before making the decision to suspend, terminate, or revoke, the city manager shall give reasonable notice to the permittee and an opportunity to be heard. If because of emergency or insufficient time, the decision is made without giving reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard, notice and an opportunity to be heard shall be given promptly. A permit may be revoked pursuant to this section even if the person making the findings pursuant to this section (the city manager or chief of police, as applicable) had made a contrary finding before the permit was issued, regardless of whether the facts upon which the finding is made had changed. 
(b)  Notice. The city manager shall cause a written notice of the suspension, termination, or revocation to be served on the permittee by first-class mail to the address shown on the permit application or by any method allowed by law for service of a summons in a civil action, provided that the person delivering the notice may be any person who is 18 years or older, including the city manager. The notice shall set forth a brief statement of the grounds for the action and of the right to appeal. 
(c)  Retention of fees; waiting period. If the city suspends, terminates, or revokes a permit, the city shall retain the fee paid for the permit. However, when a permit is suspended or terminated entirely for reasons other than wrongful conduct or fault of the permittee or those for which the permittee is responsible, such as by use of the authority under section 66-272(a)(1), (2), fees paid in advance at a daily rate will be refunded to the extent advance payments are for three or more days. The person whose permit is revoked for grounds stated in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2), regardless of whether additional grounds existed, shall not be issued a permit under the same section of this division for the remainder of the time for which the revoked permit had been issued or 30 days after the date of the revocation, whichever time period is longer. The city manager shall use reasonable judgment in deciding whether two applicants are the same so that, for example, technical changes in the applicant, or where the applicant one year is the wife and the next year it is the husband, may be disregarded. 
(d)  Review of decisions. If the city manager suspends, terminates, or revokes a permit, the permittee may have that decision reviewed by filing a written request in the office of the city manager within ten days of the date of the notice of decision. The city manager or a person designated by the city manager for this purpose who is neither the person who made the decision complained of nor that person's subordinate, shall be named as the hearing officer to conduct a hearing in order to review the decision. The city manager shall cause a written notice of the time and place of the hearing to be given or sent to the person seeking review. The permittee and the city manager may appear in person or through counsel and may present evidence, provided, however, that the hearing officer shall have the authority to conduct the hearing in the manner and for the period of time that he or she deems appropriate to make a decision. The hearing officer may affirm, deny, or modify the decision complained of, and the hearing officer's decision shall be final. Failure to request a review within the time and in the manner provided for in this subsection shall constitute a waiver of the right of review. The permit may be used during the review process only if the city manager determines that its use would not constitute a substantial threat that the grounds described in subsection (a)(2), (a)(3), or (a)(4) will occur, re-occur, or continue during the review process. 
(Ord. No. 14809, § 2, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 66-273. - Removal of vehicles and other objects. 
(a)  Right of city to remove. The city manager may cause to be removed any vehicle or other object from a temporary construction space or time-limited parking space when (i) a permit allowing the space to be occupied has been suspended, terminated, or revoked (whether or not the action is subject to review), (ii) the vehicle or other object in the temporary construction space or time-limited parking space violates the terms of a permit or this division, or impedes the regular flow of motor vehicle traffic, or (iii) the vehicle or other object in the temporary construction space or time-limited parking space endangers property or endangers or unduly inconveniences a person. The removal shall be to a garage or other location or facility designated by the city manager. 
(b)  Duty of permittee to remove. To the extent directed by the city, when a permit issued pursuant to this division is suspended, terminated, or revoked, any person allowed to do any activity by the permit, whether or not the permit remains valid, shall promptly cease the activity and remove all property that the city deems to interfere with the purposes for which the direction is given. 
(Ord. No. 14809, § 2, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 66-274. - Penalties for violations. 
(a)  Assessment of civil penalties. The city manager shall assess civil penalties for violation of this division, including the terms of a permit. The city manager shall give the offender written notice of the nature of the violation and the amount of the civil penalty. The notice shall be served by any method allowed by law for service of a summons in a civil action, provided that the person delivering the notice may be any person who is 18 years or older, including the city manager. The civil penalty shall be in an amount $100.00 per violation plus the costs incurred by the city resulting from the violation, including costs of removing litter. 
(b)  Review of assessment of civil penalties. Any person who has been assessed a civil penalty under this division may have that assessment reviewed by filing a written request in the office of the city manager within ten days of the date of service of the notice of the civil penalty. A person designated by the city manager for this purpose who is neither the person who assessed the civil penalty nor that person's subordinate shall be named as the hearing officer to conduct a hearing in order to review the assessment. The city manager shall cause a written notice of the time and place of the hearing to be given or sent to the person seeking review. The person assessed the penalty and the city manager may appear in person or through counsel and may present evidence, provided, however, that the hearing officer shall have the authority to conduct the hearing in the manner and for the period of time that he or she deems appropriate to make a decision. The hearing officer may affirm, deny, or modify the decision complained of, and the hearing officer's decision shall be final. Failure to request a review within the time and in the manner provided for in this subsection constitutes a waiver of the right of review. 
(c)  Collection of civil penalties. If the offender does not pay the civil penalty within ten days after having been served with the notice of the civil penalty, the city manager may collect the civil penalties by causing to be commenced civil actions in the nature of debt. The city manager may compromise such claims, before or after commencement of the civil action, if the city manager finds there is a reasonable probability that the city will be unable to collect the entire amount of the claim, that the amount offered in compromise of the claim reasonably reflects either the amount of money available from the offender or the amount the city is likely to recover in the civil action, taking into account the resources required to pursue the civil action, and that the facts and circumstances of the events giving rise to the claim, taken as a whole, indicate that the amount offered in compromise is fair and reasonable. Using the foregoing standards, in an appropriate case, the city manager may abandon a claim. 
(d)  Criminal remedies. Except for provisions, if any, of this division that regulate the operation or parking of motor vehicles, each violation of this division, including the terms of a permit, is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of $500.00. 
(e)  Available remedies. This division and the provisions of permits issued under this division may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy, including abatement orders and mandatory or prohibitory injunctions, issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. The general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application of the city for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law. In applying section 1-9(e), the city council intends that termination and revocation of a permit be considered to be remedies.

(a)  When a registered owner of a vehicle has accumulated three or more outstanding and unpaid parking tickets which are 90 days overdue the city manager shall cause a notice of impending vehicle immobilization by the use of wheel locks to be sent. In such instances, the city manager shall give written notice to the registered owner of such vehicle at the last known address on file with the division of motor vehicles informing the owner that if the vehicle is found illegally parked it shall be immobilized through the use of wheel locks pursuant to section 66-43. 
(b)  The registered owner may challenge the impending immobilization by making a written request for a hearing. A hearing may be held by appearing in person, or through an agent before the city manager or by letter challenging the immobilization forwarded to the city manager. The written request for a hearing shall be received and the hearing held within 21 days of the date of the notice. All matters pertaining to the hearing such as scheduling and conducting it shall be pursuant to procedures established by the city manager. Proof of one or both of the following shall be the only basis to cancel the impending immobilization: 
(1)  All civil penalties for the violations cited in the notice have been paid in full; or 
(2)  The registered owner had not accumulated three or more tickets which were unpaid and 90 days overdue on the date of the notice of impending immobilization. 
(c)  Failure to timely request a hearing shall constitute a waiver of the right to the hearing. If the hearing is waived or does not result in cancellation of the impending immobilization, then if the vehicle is found illegally parked it may be immobilized using a wheel lock device.

Sec. 66-375. - Immobilization of vehicles. 
(a)  The city manager may immobilize by the use of wheel locks and tow and impound any vehicle which is illegally parked in violation of article IV and for which there are three or more outstanding, unpaid, and overdue parking tickets for a period of 90 days. For the purpose of determining whether an illegally-parked vehicle has had issued against it three or more outstanding, unpaid, and overdue parking tickets for a period of 90 days, it shall be sufficient if the license plate number of the illegally-parked vehicle and the license plate number of the vehicle having received the tickets are the same. 
(b)  If a wheel lock is attached to a vehicle, a notice shall be affixed to the windshield or other part of the vehicle so as to be readily visible. The notice shall warn that the vehicle has been immobilized and that any attempt to move the vehicle may result in damage to the vehicle. The city shall not be responsible for any damage to an immobilized, illegally-parked vehicle resulting from unauthorized attempts to free or move the vehicle. An immobilization fee set by the city council shall be charged for the removal of the wheel lock. The notice shall include the amount of the immobilization fee and the total amount of civil penalties for parking tickets which are overdue and unpaid and attributable to such vehicle. The hours, address, and telephone number of the designated agent where the vehicle owner may pay the charges to have the wheel lock removed shall also appear on the notice. 
(c)  If civil penalties due and an immobilization fee as herein provided are not paid, or satisfactory arrangements in lieu of payment are not made within 24 hours of attachment of the wheel lock, such vehicle may be towed to and impounded in any public or private impoundment lot. If a private contractor tows and stores the vehicle, he or she may impose against the vehicle his or her customary fees and charges for such services. Once a vehicle has been impounded, the department designated by the city manager shall mail a notice of impoundment to the registered owner and lienholder, if known, at the address reported to the city by the state division of motor vehicles. 
(d)  Upon payment of all civil penalties and overdue and unpaid parking tickets issued for the vehicle and of all other charges authorized by this section, including immobilization, towing, and impoundment fees, the vehicle shall be released to the owner or any other person legally entitled to claim possession of the vehicle. 
(e)  The owner or other person entitled to possession of the vehicle which has been immobilized pursuant to this section, may submit a written request for a hearing to the person designated by the city manager, by certified mail or personal delivery within seven calendar days of receipt of the notice provided for in subsection (c) of this section. If a hearing is requested, a statement shall be sent by the city manager to the requesting party to inform him or her of the time and place of the hearing, of the basis of the vehicle's immobilization and impoundment, of the rules governing conduct of the hearing, and of the right to present evidence as to why the vehicle should not have been immobilized or towed, and of the right to be represented by counsel. The hearing officer appointed by the city manager shall prepare a written report of his or her findings within three days of the hearing. The report shall state his or her conclusion as to whether the vehicle was properly immobilized and towed, and the reasons underlying his or her conclusion. If it is concluded that the vehicle was improperly immobilized or towed, then any improper charges shall be canceled, or, if paid, rebated. The city shall not be responsible for any consequential damages or costs the vehicle owner incurs in conjunction with the hearing process. 
(f)  It shall be unlawful for anyone to remove from a vehicle a wheel lock placed pursuant to this section, or to remove from impoundment any vehicle placed therein pursuant to this section, without all civil penalties and applicable charges having first been paid or an approved payment plan having been made. 
(g)  The city manager is authorized to establish guidelines to adjust the amount of civil penalties imposed pursuant to this section, to promote the resolution of any claim against a person with ten or more outstanding delinquent parking tickets.

Sec. 66-431. - Permit application; conditions of issuance; appeals. 
(a)  The city manager shall not order a street closed or issue a permit for the use of such street pursuant to section 66-430 except upon written application. The city manager may issue such order and such permit if the city manager finds: 
(1)  The proposed street closing and the proposed use of the closed street will not unreasonably interfere with the normal activities of surrounding residents, businesses, or institutions. 
(2)  The street proposed to be closed will reasonably and safely accommodate the expected number of persons. 
(3)  Neither the proposed use nor the anticipated sound or noise level arising from such use will have an unreasonably adverse effect upon surrounding residents, businesses, or institutions.

(9)  The applicant has obtained such liability insurance coverage as may be required for the proposed events by a schedule of insurance prepared by the city manager. 
(10)  Notice of the proposed street closing has been given in accordance with the instructions given by the city manager. 
(11)  In order to take into account timing of issuance of required regulatory permits and for the applicant to arrange for required city services, the street closing order may be issued with conditions related to such permits. 
(b)  (1)  With the advice of the city attorney, the city manager shall establish rules setting reasonable periods of time to respond to applications. Rules, including revisions, established under this subsection shall include a statement that the city attorney was consulted in writing the rules. When the city manager neither explicitly denies nor grants an application within 30 days after receiving it, the city manager shall be deemed to have denied the application on all grounds on the 30th day. The city manager's time periods shall include a provision requiring an expedited review and decision either (a) when the proposed use of the closed street or sidewalk is solely for a First Amendment protected activity, or (b) when an applicant shows compelling reasons for a shortened review period. When the city manager neither explicitly denies nor grants an application within such expedited review period, the city manager shall be deemed to have denied the application on all grounds on the last day of the review period. 
(2)  Interim rules for the expedited review and decision period. Until the city manager establishes rules that provide otherwise this subsection (2) applies. When the proposed use of the closed street or sidewalk is solely for a First Amendment protected activity, or when an applicant shows compelling reasons for a shortened review period, the application shall be submitted to the city at least 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays, before the proposed event. When the proposed use of the closed street or sidewalk is solely for a First Amendment protected activity, and the city manager is confident that adequate preparations can be made - acting reasonably, without extraordinary actions, and without endangering public safety and property - in less than 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays, before the proposed event, the city manager will shorten that 48-hour period accordingly. When the city manager neither explicitly denies nor grants an application with in a time period provided for it by this subsection (2), the city manager shall be deemed to have denied the application on all grounds at of the end of that time period. 
(c)  Except in the instance of a denial deemed to occur pursuant to subsection (b), the city manager shall specify the grounds for denial from the following: 
(1)  The application is not complete; 
(2)  The applicant has not tendered the required indemnification agreements, insurance certificates, and security deposits within times prescribed; 
(3)  The application contains a material falsehood, misstatement of fact, or misrepresentation; 
(4)  The applicant is legally incompetent to contract or to be sued; 
(5)  The applicant has on prior occasions made a material misrepresentation in any transaction with the city to the extent that a reasonable person would have reason to question the truth of statements made in or in connection with the application for a street closing or a special event; 
(6)  The applicant has previously violated or allowed a violation of a street closing or special event permit to the extent that a reasonable person would have reason to question whether the applicant will comply with the requested permit; 
(7)  The proposed use would conflict with a use that the city has already planned or approved; 
(8)  The proposed event would present an unreasonable danger to the public health or safety; 
(9)  The proposed event is likely to substantially or unnecessarily interfere with traffic; 
(10)  A reasonable alternative location, time, or date is available that would substantially better accommodate the needs and uses of the general public than the proposed location, time, or date (alternative location and time includes closing none or a smaller portion of a street and a shorter time period); 
(12)  The event is likely to interfere with the movement of emergency equipment and personnel and police protection; 
(13)  There is a substantial risk that insufficient law enforcement and traffic control officers would be available to adequately protect participants and non-participants from traffic-related hazards in light of the other demands for police protection; 
(14)  The use or activity intended by the applicant is prohibited by law; 
(15)  For all activities that are not First Amendment protected activities, the city manager shall consider these additional criteria. More positive findings on these additional criteria can allow for a street closing, or a larger street closing, while more negative findings will tend to support no street closing, a different day or time, or a smaller street closing.

ii.  The extent to which the event contributes to the economic revitalization and business development of the city; 
iii.  The effect on, and cost of the event to, city support services;

(a)  To the extent directed by the city, any person allowed to do any activity by this article or by a permit shall promptly cease the activity and remove all property that the city deems to interfere with the purposes for which the direction is given. The city reserves the right to rescind in whole or in part any order and to require any activity allowed by this article or by a permit to cease in whole or in part. The city may exercise the authority listed in this subsection for any purpose, including: 
(1)  To allow for construction, maintenance, or repair of any public street, sidewalk, utility, building, or facility; 
(2)  To allow for use of a public street, sidewalk, utility, building, or facility in connection with parades, festivals, or other events; 
(3)  To remedy a nuisance; or 
(4)  To protect or promote the public health, safety, or welfare. 
(b)  In case of emergency, danger to property, or detriment, danger, or hazard to public health, safety, or welfare, the city manager may, orally or in writing, direct any person allowed to do any activity by this article or by a permit to immediately move such distance as the city manager specifies, and to cease acts determined by the city manager to contribute to the emergency, danger, detriment, or hazard. Upon receiving such direction, the individual shall comply. When such a direction is not complied with, the city manager may cause objects in violation of the direction to be removed, disposed of, or both, and the cost of such actions shall be borne by the offender. This subsection shall not be construed to limit subsection (a). 
(c)  The police may authorize any person to drive a vehicle on the closed street in order to exit the area, if the vehicle is parked in a location from which the only reasonable exit is over the closed street. The police may authorize a vehicle to enter the closed street in order to park in a space designated with a sign pursuant to G.S. 20-37.6(d) for handicapped persons. 
(d)  Nothing in this division shall be construed to limit any other ordinance, including section 66-108 (driving over curbs, gutters or sidewalks at places other than those constructed and designed for traffic), section 66-109 (driving on sidewalk), and those imposing parking restrictions. Nothing in this division shall be construed to limit the authority of the N.C. Department of Transportation over rights-of-way under its jurisdiction. 
(e)  The principle that the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another is not to be used to construe this division to grant to the public any right to use property owned or controlled by the city.

Sec. 66-435. - Revocation of permit; review of decisions. 
(a)  Revocation; grounds and procedure for revocation. The city manager may, at any time, including while the street is closed and the permittee's activities on the closed street are taking place, revoke any permit issued under this article and any order closing a street or sidewalk issued in relation to or in connection with a permit if the city manager finds: 
(1)  Fraud, misrepresentation, or a knowingly false statement with respect to a material fact in the permit application; 
(2)  The permittee or the permittee's agent or employee violated this article or the terms of the permit; 
(3)  The permittee or the permittee's agent or employee conducted an activity for which a permit is required in such a manner as to create a public nuisance, cause a breach of the peace, violate any applicable law, or interfere with the rights of abutting property owners; 
(4)  Conditions, such as a public emergency, exist which, had they existed or been known at the time the permit was issued would have resulted in denial of the permit; 
(5)  There is a substantial likelihood that the proposed use of the street or sidewalk or the closing of the street or sidewalk will be detrimental to public health or safety; 
(6)  There is a substantial likelihood that conditions on the street or sidewalk designated to be closed will occur which would result in substantial risk of harm to persons or property; or 
(7)  There is a substantial likelihood that activities proposed to take place on or in connection with the street or sidewalk designated to be closed will occur which would result in substantial risk of harm to persons or property. 
Except in case of emergency or impracticality, before revoking the permit, the city manager shall give reasonable notice to the permittee and an opportunity to be heard. A permit may be revoked pursuant to this section even if the person making the findings pursuant to this section had made a contrary finding before the permit was issued, regardless of whether the facts upon which the finding is made had changed. 
(b)  Notice. 
(1)  The city manager shall cause a written notice of the revocation to be served on the permittee by first-class mail, email or other electronic means, or fax, to the address or number shown on the permit application, or by any method allowed by law for service of a summons in a civil action. The person serving the notice may be any person who is 18 years or older, including the city manager. 
(2)  If the city manager finds that time before a proposed hearing is insufficient to allow service in accordance with subsection (1), the city manager may, as an alternative to the means listed in subsection (1), notify the permittee by telephone of the grounds for revocation and of the right to appeal, provided a written notice is also sent in accordance with subsection (1) on or before the next day that is not a holiday. 
(3)  The notice described in subsection (1) shall set forth a brief statement of the grounds for revocation and of the right to appeal. 
(4)  The city manager shall see that a written record is made to show compliance with this subsection (b). 
(c)  Retention of fees; waiting period. If the city revokes a permit, the city shall retain the fee, if any, paid for the permit. The person whose permit is revoked for grounds stated in subsection (a)(l), (a)(2), or (a)(3), regardless of whether additional grounds existed, shall not be issued a permit under the same section of this article for the remainder of the time for which the revoked permit had been issued or 30 days after the date of the revocation, whichever time period is longer. The city manager shall use reasonable judgment in deciding whether two applicants are the same so that, for example, technical changes in the applicant, or where the applicant one year is the wife and the next year it is the husband, may be disregarded. 
(d)  Review of decisions. 
(1)  If the city manager denies the issuance of a permit, revokes a permit, issues a permit with terms deemed unacceptable to the permittee, or makes any other decision pursuant to this article with respect to a permit, the applicant or permittee may have that decision reviewed by filing a written request in the office of the city manager within ten days of the date of the notice of decision. The city manager or a person designated by the city manager for this purpose who is neither the person who made the decision complained of nor that person's subordinate, shall be named as the hearing officer to conduct a hearing in order to review the decision. The city manager shall cause a written notice of the time and place of the hearing to be given or sent to the person seeking review. The city manager shall expedite the review process when the proposed use of the closed street or sidewalk is solely for a First Amendment protected activity or the person seeking review shows compelling reasons for a shortened review period. The failure of the hearing officer to set a hearing within 15 days of the filing of the written request for review, or to deliver a decision within ten days after the hearing, or within any shortened periods set by the city manager, shall be deemed a denial of the relief sought and affirmance of the action for which review was sought. The permittee and the city manager may appear in person or through counsel and may present evidence, provided, however, that the hearing officer shall have the authority to conduct the hearing in the manner and for the period of time that he or she deems appropriate to make a decision. The hearing officer may affirm, deny, or modify the decision complained of, and the hearing officer's decision shall be final. Failure to request a review within the time and in the manner provided for in this subsection shall constitute a waiver of the right of review. The permit may be used during the review process only if the city manager determines that its use would not constitute a substantial threat that the grounds described in subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) will occur, re-occur, or continue during the review process. 
(2)  Interim rules for the expedited review and decision period. Until the city manager establishes rules that provide otherwise, when an application is subject to the expedited review and decision period pursuant to section 66-431(b) or a rule established pursuant thereto, the hearing shall be held within two days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the written request for review is filed in the office of the city manager. When the city manager does not issue a decision on a review subject to that time period within two days after the date of the hearing, the city manager is deemed to have affirmed the decision on that second day. 
(e)  Certiorari. 
(1)  A decision by the hearing officer is subject to review by the Durham County Superior Court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. The petition for review shall be filed with the clerk of Superior Court within the earlier of 30 days after the denial and affirmance are deemed to occur pursuant to subsection (d), or within 30 days after the decision is delivered to the applicant. Delivery is made by hand-delivery of the decision to the applicant, or by first-class or certified mail to the address provided on the application. Delivery by mail is complete when placed in the custody of the U.S. Postal Service. 
(2)  Interim rules for the expedited review and decision period . Until the city manager establishes rules that provide otherwise, when an application is subject to the expedited review and decision period pursuant to section 66-431(b) or a rule established pursuant thereto, the city shall file a copy of the record within five days, excluding weekends and holidays, unless the writ specifies otherwise. 
(Ord. No. 14845, § 4, 10-19-2015) 
Sec. 66-436. - Penalties for violations. 
(a)  Assessment of civil penalties. The city manager shall assess civil penalties for violation of this article, including the terms of a permit. The city manager shall give the offender written notice of the nature of the violation and the amount of the civil penalty. The notice shall be served by any method allowed by law for service of a summons in a civil action, provided that the person delivering the notice may be any person who is 18 years or older, including the city manager. The civil penalty shall be $200.00 per violation plus the costs incurred by the city resulting from the violation, including costs of removing litter. 
(b)  Review of assessment of civil penalties. Any person who has been assessed a civil penalty under this article may have that assessment reviewed by filing a written request in the office of the city manager within ten days of the date of service of the notice of the civil penalty. A person designated by the city manager for this purpose who is neither the person who assessed the civil penalty nor that person's subordinate shall be named as the hearing officer to conduct a hearing in order to review the assessment. The city manager shall cause a written notice of the time and place of the hearing to be given or sent to the person seeking review. The person assessed the penalty and the city manager may appear in person or through counsel and may present evidence, provided, however, that the hearing officer shall have the authority to conduct the hearing in the manner and for the period of time that he or she deems appropriate to make a decision. The hearing officer may affirm, deny, or modify the decision complained of, and the hearing officer's decision shall be final. Failure to request review within the time and in the manner provided for in this subsection constitutes a waiver of the right of review. 
(c)  Collection of civil penalties. If the offender does not pay the civil penalty within ten days after having been served with the notice of the civil penalty, the city manager may collect the civil penalties by causing to be commenced civil actions in the nature of debt. The city manager may compromise such claims, before or after commencement of the civil action, if the city manager finds there is a reasonable probability that the city will be unable to collect the entire amount of the claim, that the amount offered in compromise of the claim reasonably reflects either the amount of money available from the offender or the amount the city is likely to recover in the civil action, taking into account the resources required to pursue the civil action, and that the facts and circumstances of the events giving rise to the claim, taken as a whole, indicate that the amount offered in compromise is fair and reasonable. Using the foregoing standards, in an appropriate case, the city manager may abandon a claim. 
(d)  Criminal remedies. Except for provisions, if any, of this article that regulate the operation or parking of motor vehicles, each violation of this article, including the terms of a permit, is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of $500.00. 
(e)  Available remedies. This article and the provisions of permits issued under this article may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy, including abatement orders and mandatory or prohibitory injunctions, issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. The general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application of the city for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law. In applying subsection 1-9(e), the city council intends that revocation of a permit be deemed to be a remedy.

Sec. 66-437. - Cumulative requirements. 
    No provisions of the City Code, except those explicitly repealed or explicitly amended by the ordinance adopting this article, are repealed by this article. If any provision of this article allows an activity to occur but another provision of the City Code regulates or prohibits it, the more restrictive provision applies.

(3)  When the city manager or the city manager's designee has made a determination that a water main or sewer main, or both, will not be installed in a section of street due to topography, a service boundary limitation, or some other compelling reason, a frontage charge shall not be applied to the frontage abutting that street section. 
(4)  Where the city has assessed a property for the construction of a water main or sewer main, or both, and the property was granted relief from all or a portion of the assessment, a property so relieved shall not be subject to a frontage charge, unless the assessment relief was granted with a provision that future frontage charges would be due and payable at the time the property received service. 
(5)  Where a water or sewer line has been extended ("extended utilities") pursuant to a utility extension agreement ("agreement") that requires reimbursement of frontage fees collected by the city to a developer, the city shall only collect frontage fees at the prevailing rate until the date the reimbursement provision in the agreement expires. Frontage fees shall not be collected by the city for new water or sewer connections to the extended utilities after the expiration of the reimbursement provision in the agreement. 
(6)  For a property that is a corner lot zoned entirely for single-family residential use, there shall be no frontage charge levied for the first 200 feet of frontage on the longer side of the lot. For corner lots that are not zoned entirely for single-family residential use, there shall be no frontage charge levied for the first 100 feet of frontage on the longer side of the lot. 
(7)  For a property that has frontage on more than one street, that is not a corner lot, that is zoned entirely for single-family residential use, and that cannot be subdivided into more than one buildable parcel, only the frontage along the front of property shall be considered in computing the frontage charge (or in the case of a lot that has frontage on three or more streets, the front and side of the lot in accordance with number 6 of this section). 
(8)  For a property that is zoned entirely for single-family residential use, a property shall pay a frontage charge based on a frontage length no greater than 116 feet at the prevailing frontage rate for each separate connection to the water or sewer main. 
(9)  For a property that is zoned entirely for single-family residential use that has a frontage less than 50 feet, that property shall pay a frontage charge based upon a frontage length of 50 feet at the prevailing frontage rate for each separate connection to the water or sewer main. 
(10)  If a property owner has previously paid a frontage charge for water and sewer infrastructure, that property shall not be subject to a later assessment imposed for the installation of water and sewer infrastructure fronting the property.

Sec. 70-18. - Federal block grant funds for water mains and sewer mains; no charge to be made. 
    The charges provided for in section 70-17 do not apply to water mains and sewer mains which are installed with federal block grant funds. When water mains or sewer mains are installed with block grant funds received from the federal government, no special assessment charges are to be levied against the property benefited thereby. 
(Code 1964, § 18-12.2; Code 1982, § 23-18.1; Ord. No. 5322, § 2, 1-7-1980) 
Sec. 70-19. - Authority to contract to provide reimbursement for the cost of certain water and sewer facilities and to require payment by future developers for such facilities as a precondition of connection. 
    The city may enter into agreements that provide for the reimbursement of a portion of the construction costs of certain water and sanitary sewer facilities ("developer and/or city-constructed facilities") when the facilities have been designed at the city's direction to take into account city determined needs regarding future development and, in addition, when the scale, scope, or size of the developer and/or city-constructed facilities are atypical and substantially larger than what is needed for a specific development, or other unique circumstances apply. Without limiting the city's authority under general law or ordinance, only sewer outfalls ten inches in diameter or larger, force mains, sewer pumping stations, water mains larger than 16 inches, booster stations, flow control valves, aboveground storage, and applicable engineering costs shall be eligible for reimbursement in agreements authorized under this section. Reimbursement shall be limited to payments from future users that benefit from the developer and/or city-constructed facilities. Future users include developers of future projects. In addition to any other fees provided by law or ordinance, the city may require such future users to pay a fair portion of the cost of the developer and/or city constructed facilities as a precondition of extension of water and/or sewer infrastructure to a proposed development. If such fees are imposed on future developments, a fee ordinance enacting such fees shall be required. 
    For developer constructed facilities only, the city shall reimburse a developer who constructs developer constructed facilities pursuant to the terms of a written agreement made under this section and approved by city council, but only after future users of the developer constructed facilities make payment to the city. The city shall develop written policies consistent with this section that apportion the original documented costs of developer constructed facilities subject to agreements amongst future users in a fair and equitable manner, as determined in the sole discretion of the city. Agreements under this section shall, among other things, specify the time period for which reimbursements shall apply. In addition, agreements shall provide for a reasonable administrative charge to be retained by the city for the city's expense in administering a reimbursement program. No agreement shall obligate the city to reimburse costs of developer constructed facilities if payments are not received for any reason, nor shall any agreement limit the city's authority to modify this section. This section shall not limit the city's authority under any other section of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 14749, § 1, 5-18-2015) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 14749, § 1, adopted May 18, 2015, repealed and replaced § 70-19 in its entirety. Former § 70-19 pertained to authority to contract to provide reimbursement for the cost of certain sewer facilities and to require payment by future developers for such facilities as a precondition of connection, and was derived from Code 1982, § 23-18.2; Ord. No. 12501, § 1, adopted February 4, 2002 and Ord. No. 13147, adopted June 20, 2005. 
Sec. 70-20. - Maintenance and repair of water connections, pipes, etc. 
    The city shall maintain all water connections within the streets or public right-of-way and shall absorb the cost of such repairs and maintenance through the fees charged pursuant to section 70-51. All pipes and fixtures within private property shall be kept in repair by the property owner or consumer. When repairs are not made to prevent waste of water within 48 hours after receiving notice from the city manager, the city shall discontinue service until such time as the repairs are made or shall have the right to enter on the property and make the necessary repairs. The work by the city shall be limited to the necessary water line repairs and backfilling. The cost of repairs performed by the city shall be charged to the property owner, and service may not be reinstated until they are paid. 
(Code 1964, § 18-19; Code 1982, § 23-19; Ord. No. 7773, § 1, 3-20-1989; Ord. No. 9451, § 1, 11-18-1991) 
Sec. 70-21. - Maintenance and repair of sewer laterals outside of street property line or right-of-way line. 
    The maintenance and repair of sewer lines and house connections outside of the street property line or right-of-way line shall be the responsibility of the property owner. The city shall not undertake to repair or maintain the house connections to its sewer line until it has been determined that the disrepair, stoppage or other cause or impediment to the proper functioning of such line exists within that portion of the lateral between the main line and the property line or right-of-way lines. If the property owner or the representative of the property owner claims that the cause of such stoppage or disturbance exists on that portion of the lateral lying between the main line and the property line and an investigation discloses that the cause of such disturbance actually exists in that portion of the line lying between the property line and the structure which is serviced by such line, the property owner shall pay to the city the actual cost to the city of making such investigation. If, however, upon investigation it is found that the cause of such disturbance or disrepair is in that portion of the line lying between the property line and the main line, the city shall make such repair without additional cost to the property owner.

Sec. 70-22. - Fire protection plans for certain developments prerequisite to installation of water connections. 
(a)  Each development in any of the following categories shall have a fire protection plan approved by the city manager, fire chief or their designee, prior to the issuance of a building permit and prior to the installation of water connections or the extension of existing water installations: 
(1)  Group apartment housing (projects consisting of more than one structure situated on one tract under common ownership and not intended to be capable of subdividing into individual lots or tracts for sale purposes). 
(2)  Motels, hotels. 
(3)  Hospitals. 
(4)  Warehouses, industrial buildings (under one ownership and engaged in one business only). 
(5)  Schools. 
(6)  Trailer courts. 
(7)  Shopping centers. 
(8)  Condominium developments (individual ownership of a single unit in a multi-unit structure with common elements, such as hallways, parking bays and open spaces). 
(9)  Townhouse developments (a development consisting of one or more residential structures comprised of two or more attached single-family residences intended for owner-occupancy with individual residences located on their own individual lots with the possibility of common ownership of open spaces, parking bays, etc.). 
(10)  Religious facilities. 
(11)  Homes for the ill or aged, including rest and convalescent homes. 
(12)  Building construction in excess of three stories aboveground level. 
(b)  The fire protection plan shall be submitted in triplicate to the fire chief or the fire chief's designee for approval. The city reserves the right to require proper size water lines, proper hydrant spacing and location and the installation of metering devices where it shall be determined that water is being used for other than fire protection purposes exclusively. All water facilities constructed on private property for the purpose of firefighting shall be in accordance with city standards and specifications. Construction beyond the water meter may be with materials permitted in the city plumbing code; however, all construction between the water meter and a fire hydrant or other fire protection device shall be in accordance with city standards and specifications. 
(Code 1964, § 18-15; Code 1982, § 23-21; Ord. No. 7773, § 1, 3-20-1989) 
Sec. 70-23. - Use of fire hydrants. 
    Fire hydrants shall be used predominantly by the fire department for the purpose of providing fire protection. Other city departments shall be permitted to use fire hydrants on a limited basis to undertake legitimate public purposes. Fire hydrants shall not be otherwise used for any purpose, unless written approval is received from the city. Persons who wish to use hydrants to provide water during the construction process or for other purposes shall apply to the city for a permit for such use. The city shall establish policies regarding such use. These policies may, amongst other things, require that only city equipment be used to meter the water used, and to prevent the backflow of water into the system, and that users employ other special equipment and/or use certain practices in opening and closing hydrants, attaching and detaching equipment, and moving equipment to other hydrants. These policies may establish reasonable deposits for use of city equipment, which shall not exceed an amount set by the city council. Violation of the city's policies is considered a violation of the City Code, and may be remedied through any means available for violations of the City Code. 
(Code 1964, § 18-21; Code 1982, § 23-22; Ord. No. 7773, § 1, 3-20-1989; Ord. No. 12172, § 1, 2-5-2001) 
Sec. 70-24. - Limitation on assessments for water and sewer main improvements. 
    The maximum cost to be assessed property owners for water and sewer main improvements per front foot of property abutting such improvements shall be the amount established by resolution adopted by the city council and available for public review in the office of the city clerk and the office of the city engineer. 
(Code 1964, § 18-22; Code 1982, § 23-23; Ord. No. 4982, § 1, 9-5-1978; Ord. No. 6799, § 1, 10-7-1985) 
Sec. 70-25. - Resale of water and/or sewer service. 
    No water and/or sewer customer shall supply or resell water and/or sewer service from the public water and/or sewer system. Notwithstanding this prohibition, owners of a residential apartment complex where submeters have been installed may charge tenants for water and/or sewer service for the purpose of fairly allocating the cost of such service to each dwelling unit subject to the conditions set forth below. For purposes of this section, a residential apartment complex is defined as premises not separated by property owned by others where one or more buildings under common ownership comprising 15 or more apartments are available for rent by residential tenants. 
(1)  The rate charged shall be no greater than that charged by the city. Any administrative or service charge billed by the city may be apportioned among the tenant bills. Additional apartment owner service or administrative charges may be added to the amount billed by the city in accordance with the state utilities commission regulations; 
(2)  The owner shall be in compliance with all the regulations of the city and other governmental agencies which may have jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, the state public utilities commission and the state division of environmental health; 
(3)  The owner shall notify the city manager or his or her designee in writing that the structure will be submetered and indicate the expected date of the initial billing of tenants; 
(4)  The tenant billing cycle shall coincide with the city's billing cycle. The owner shall maintain the following records on the site for inspection during reasonable business hours by the city manager or his or her designee and the tenants: 
a.  The billing from the city to the owner for the current month and the 12 preceding months; 
b.  The calculation of the average cost per 100 cubic feet or per 1,000 gallons for the current month and the 12 preceding months; 
c.  All submeter readings and tenant billings for the current month and the 12 preceding months; 
d.  All sub-meter test results for the current month and the 12 preceding months. 
(5)  All rental agreements between the owner and the tenants shall clearly state that the dwelling unit is submetered, that bills will be issued based on such metered charges, that water and/or sewer charges based on water consumption for all common areas and common facilities will be the responsibility of the owner and not the tenant, and that any disputes relating to the computation of the tenant's bill and the accuracy of the submetering device will be between the tenant and the owner; 
(6)  The owner shall not terminate a tenant's water and/or sewer service for failure to pay tenant's water and/or sewer bill. 
    Failure to comply with the requirements of this section shall be a violation of this chapter, subject to all remedies authorized by law, and shall also be grounds for termination of the right to bill tenants in accordance with submetered charges.

(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to willfully, with intent to injure or defraud, commit any of the following acts: 
(1)  Obstruct, alter, bypass, tamper with, injure or prevent the action of a meter or other instrument used to measure or register the quantity of water passing through such meter by a person other than an employee or authorized contractor of the city. 
(2)  Make any connection or reconnection with the water or sewer pipes of the city, turn on or off or in any manner interfere with any valve or other portion of the city water and sewer infrastructure, and connected with city service or other pipes, for any purpose without first procuring from the city a written permit to turn on or off such valve, pump, or other appliance, or to make such connection or reconnections, or to interfere with the valves, or other appliances of such, as the case may be. 
(3)  Retain possession of or refuse to deliver any meter or other appliance which may be leased or rented by any person, for the purpose of furnishing water through the same, or sell, lend or in any other manner dispose of the same to any person other than the city. 
(4)  Reconnect water or sewer connections or otherwise turn back on one or more of those utilities when they have been lawfully disconnected or turned off by the city. 
(b)  Any meter found to have been altered, tampered with, or bypassed in a manner that would cause such meter to inaccurately measure and register the water consumed or which would cause the water to be diverted from the recording apparatus of the meter shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to violate and of the violation of this section by the person in whose name such meter is installed or the person or persons so using or receiving the benefits of such unmetered, unregistered, or diverted water. 
(c)  Criminal violations of this section shall be punishable as follows: 
(1)  A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. 
(2)  A second or subsequent violation of this section is a Class H felony. 
(3)  A violation of this section that results in significant property damage or public endangerment is a Class F felony.

ARTICLE II. - SERVICE CHARGES, RATES AND RENTALS 

Sec. 70-49. - Deposits and fees for water service. 
(a)  The following deposits are required inside and outside the corporate limits: 
(1)  Domestic customers of water, opening accounts after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, shall make a deposit in the amount set forth by city council from time to time. However, residential customers shall be exempt from deposit requirements of this subsection if they provide an acceptable letter of credit from their previous utility provider or if they currently have service with the city and have had no cutoff/past due amounts in the past 12 months or other suitable credit reference acceptable to the city manager. 
(2)  Domestic water customers who have water service discontinued due to failure to make payment shall not be provided again with water service unless the account holder makes an additional deposit of $50.00 for each disconnection for nonpayment, not to exceed a total deposit amount per account of $200.00. Such deposit shall be in addition to previous deposits, and applicable cut-off and reconnection (cut-on) charges. All applicable charges shall be required to be paid before water service shall again be furnished to the premises in question, unless payment arrangements agreeable to the city manager or designee are made. 
(3)  For all other accounts, a deposit depending on the size of the meter is required unless waived at the discretion of the city manager. A schedule of such deposit amounts shall be set by the city council. 
(4)  A deposit not in excess of the amount set forth by city council from time to time is required for the temporary use of water from fire hydrants, the amount of the deposit, its use, and the proportion to be returned shall be as provided by departmental policy. 
(b)  The deposits required by this section to be paid to the city shall be without liability on the part of the city for profit or interest. As to the deposits made under the provisions of this section, before its amendment by Ordinance No. 1176, the city shall be liable to pay interest at the rate of six percent per annum, to July 1, 1952, but from and after July 1, 1952, the certificates of deposit shall not bear interest and the city shall be without liability for profit or interest upon such deposits, anything herein or in the receipt or certificate of deposit entered into between the city and the depositor to the contrary notwithstanding. 
(c)  As to such deposits made prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, as amended, the depositor shall be entitled to surrender the certificate of deposit or receipt now held by him or her and exchange the same for an amended certificate or receipt containing the provisions that such deposit shall not bear interest or profit, and if the depositor fails and neglects to surrender such certificate of deposit and exchange the same on or before July 1, 1952, such certificate of deposit heretofore issued and then held by such depositor shall be considered amended in the particulars set forth in this section. 
(d)  The deposits heretofore or hereafter made shall be used for the purpose of ensuring the payment of water bills and to secure the city against any loss that might be incurred in furnishing water or servicing such account, and such deposit shall be refunded if the city finds that the customer has had no disconnections or past due accounts within a two-year period. The city may, at its option, apply the deposit, or any portion thereof, to the payment of indebtedness which may accrue against the depositor or premises for and on account of which the deposit is made. 
(Code 1964, § 18-27; Code 1982, § 23-40; Ord. No. 5967, § 1, 8-2-1982; Ord. No. 6025, § 1, 6-21-1982; Ord. No. 7773, § 1, 3-20-1989; Ord. No. 7745, § 1, 4-17-1989; Ord. No. 12172, § 1, 2-5-2001; Ord.

Sec. 70-50. - Capital facility and service area fees for water and sewer connections. 
(a)  Capital facilities fees for all new connections to the city's water and/or sewer system shall be as set by city council. The fees for one-inch meter connections to the water and sewer system shall be the same as for five-eights-inch meter connections to the water and sewer system where the larger meter is necessary not because of any additional needed capacity of volume of service but rather, solely to ensure adequate water pressure. The fees for replacement of an existing meter with a meter of larger size shall be determined by subtracting the fees chargeable for the old meter size from the fees chargeable for the new meter size. Meters used to provide a second water-only service to single-family residential customers for outdoor/irrigation purposes shall be exempted from capital facility fees. 
    Properties adjoining water or sewer extensions that were approved by the city council as of July 1, 2008 and which were not assessed by March 1, 2008 may pay the capital facilities fee rate in effect at the time of city council approval of the extension provided that a completed application for service under subsection (b) or (c) is received by November 1, 2008. 
    City council may also establish future water and sewer service areas ("service areas"). Service areas may be established when it is anticipated by the city that infrastructure (for example, gravity sewer outfalls, lift stations, force mains, or water line loops) will need to be constructed in order to provide water and sewer service to new development within the service area. Based upon the anticipated cost to construct the required infrastructure, city council may establish fees ("service area fees") that will be charged to new residential and commercial development within the service area that will make use of the infrastructure, and for which a utility extension agreement is required pursuant to article III of this chapter. 
(b)  The fees, other than service area fees, may be paid in installments where the city council determines that the property being connected to the city's water or sewer system meets all of the following qualifications: 
(1)  Service must be obtained from existing lines or outfalls without the extension of street water or sewer mains; 
(2)  The property is being served by on-site or private water or sewer facilities at the time that the request for service is made; 
(3)  The service connection includes: 
a.  The installation of a three-fourths-inch water service, a five-eighths-inch water meter, or one-inch water meter where the larger meter is necessary not because of any additional needed capacity or volume of service but rather solely to ensure adequate water pressure; or 
b.  The installation of a four-inch sewer service; and 
(4)  The city has received and completed application for payment of fees in installments. Fees under this subsection (b) shall be payable in eight equal annual installments. The first installment is due and payable 50 days from the date when the city approves payment of the facilities fee in installments. Subsequent installments are due and payable each succeeding year thereafter on the anniversary of the date when the city approves payment of the facilities fee in installments. Installments shall bear interest at an interest rate set by the city council, not to exceed nine percent per annum, from the date when the city approves payment of the facilities fee in installments. From and after the date that the city approves payment of the facilities fee in installments, the fees shall be a lien on the property as provided in section 115.6(c) of the Charter. The provisions of section 115.6(d) of the Charter shall apply where any installment, with accrued interest, is not paid when due. 
(c)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), the fees, other than service area fees, shall be payable at a time an application for service connection is filed. If for any reason, connection is made or occurs prior to payment of the fees and the city has not previously approved payment of the fees in installments as provided in subsection (b), then the city shall bill the full amount of the fees on a combined utility bill for one or more public enterprise services including water and/or sewer service. In the event the customer does not pay the full amount of the combined utility bill, the partial payment will be applied to the respective charges as provided in section 70-654(a) and water and/or sewer service to the property may be terminated as provided in sections 70-57, 70-58 and 70-59. 
    Service area fees are due to the city at the time of construction drawing permitting or at the time established in a cost sharing agreement if such an agreement has been entered into between the city and a developer or developers pursuant to Code section 70-108. When a project does not require construction drawing approval, service area fees are due upon the submittal of a connection fee application (for meters, sewer taps, etc.). 
(d)  The fees collected shall be earmarked for and applied to the costs of constructing new water supply, water treatment and wastewater treatment facilities and expansions to existing facilities. Service area fees shall be reimbursement to the city for costs incurred by the city for the construction of the infrastructure necessary to provide water or sewer service to the associated service area.

Sec. 70-51. - Rates for water service, sewer service, and water and sewer service. 
(a)  Charges. 
(1)  Rate schedule-Inside and outside the city. The schedule of rates for water service only, water service only for irrigation/outdoor use, sewer service only, and water and sewer service, inside and outside the city, shall be as set by the city council, as set forth in the fee schedule of the city. 
(2)  Fixed consumption charge for sewer only service. Fixed consumption charges for sewer only shall be as set by the city council. 
(3)  Service charge. There shall be a service charge as set by the city council. 
(b)  Qualification for fixed rates. In order to qualify for fixed rates, as established by subsection (a)(2), a property owner is required to submit a statement declaring the number of occupants at the location upon service initiation, and prior to the beginning of each fiscal year. Changes in occupancy, including vacancy, also require an updated statement from the property owner to continue service at a fixed sewer rate for less than four occupants. Discontinuance of sewer only service will result in a fee set by the city council to reestablish the service. 
(c)  User charge cost determination. The schedule of rates for water and sewer service shall be reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that water and wastewater operations are self-sufficient, that each user pays an appropriate share of the system's cost, and that the city's governmental objectives, including the need to preserve scarce water resources, are met. The methodology for calculating the water and sewer rates shall include consideration of the following: 
(1)  Identification of direct water and wastewater costs; 
(2)  Projection of direct operations, maintenance, and capital outlay costs; 
(3)  Identification of other direct costs, such as capital improvements and debt service; 
(4)  Identification of costs that are attributable to both water and wastewater operations; 
(5)  Identification of costs that are attributable to other city departments that provide assistance to water and wastewater operations; 
(6)  Identification and projection of costs associated with specific water and wastewater services; 
(7)  Identification of other revenues; 
(8)  Allocation of costs to customer service and consumption charges; 
(9)  Location inside or outside the city; 
(10)  Water conservation objectives. 
(d)  Correction of errors. Adjustments shall be made to correct clerical and/or computer errors. If a customer is incorrectly billed, or not billed, or a bill is sent to the wrong party, the city may back bill the customer for the lesser of the actual period or a four-year period for water charges and a three-year period for other utility charges. Similarly, in the event customers are charged for services not received, a credit adjustment will be allowed only for amounts paid by the customer for charges incurred within the prior four years for water and three years for other utility charges. Customers with complaints about the accuracy of error corrections are entitled to a review as provided in section 70-58.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 13804, § 1, adopted May 18, 2009, changed the title of section 70-51 from "Monthly rates for water service, sewer service, and water and sewer service" to "Rates for water service, sewer service, and water and sewer service." 
Sec. 70-52. - Fees for disposal of domestic and nondomestic septage. 
(a)  The fee for the disposal of domestic septage at city sewage treatment plants shall be set by the city council. 
(b)  The fee for the disposal of nondomestic septage at city sewage treatment plants shall be calculated on a case by case basis to reflect the cost to the city of treatment of the septage load. 
(Code 1982, § 23-42; Ord. No. 7477, § 3, 4-5-1988; Ord. No. 8082, § 1, 6-28-1990; Ord. No. 7773, § 1, 3-20-1989; Ord. No. 10765, § 1, 6-17-1996) 
Sec. 70-53. - Imposition of sewer rental or charge and surcharges for use of sewers. 
(a)  There is hereby imposed a sewer rental or charge for the use of the sewers, sewerage system and sewage treatment works of the city upon those served thereby at the rate set forth in this article. 
(b)  In addition to the normal sewer charge imposed for the use of sewers, sewerage system and sewage treatment works of the city, there is hereby imposed a sewer surcharge on any sewer user discharging wastewater into the city sanitary sewer system which has a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) or suspended solids (SS) in excess of 250 parts per million by weight (250 parts per million by weight is equivalent to 2,085 pounds of BOD or SS per million gallons of wastewater). 
(c)  Sewer users will be billed monthly for the surcharge. The amount of the BOD surcharge will be calculated on the basis of an amount as set by city council per 1,000 pounds of BOD removed in excess of the normal amount of BOD (2,085 pounds) or part thereof. The amount of the SS surcharge will be calculated on the basis of an amount as set by city council per 1,000 pounds of SS removed in excess of the normal amount of SS (2,085 pounds) or part thereof. 
(d)  The determination of the strength (BOD and SS) of wastewater shall be made by the department of water resources as provided for in sections 70-187 through 70-403 based on wastewater samples. 
Method of Surcharge Calculation: 
    The number of thousands of pounds of BOD or SS subject to the surcharge will be determined by use of the following formula: 
P = MG × BS × 8.34/1000 
Where: 
MG = Million gallons of wastewater discharged BS = Strength of wastewater in ppm BOD or SS in excess of 250 8.34 = Pounds per gallon of water P = Pounds of BOD or SS (in thousands)  
    The sewer surcharge will then be calculated by the use of the formula: S = C x P 
Where: 
S = Amount of surcharge C = Surcharge rate (per 1,000 pounds of BOD or per 1,000 pounds of SS) P = Pounds of BOD or SS (in thousands)  
    In addition to the sewer discharge for BOD and SS, there is hereby imposed a monitoring charge on any sewer user requiring wastewater sampling for purposes of computing a BOD or SS surcharge or of ensuring compliance with the city's sewer use and pretreatment ordinances. 
    Sewer users will be billed regularly for the monitoring charge. The amount of the monitoring charge will be calculated on the basis of an amount as set by city council and a charge for each type of test according to a schedule of charges per sample obtained and analyzed. 
    Where a subclass of customers from a customer class is sampled for computing a surcharge for each customer in the customer class, the sampling charges will be prorated equally to each customer in the customer class. 
(Code 1964, § 18-29; Code 1982, § 23-43; Ord. No. 5707, § 1, 6-22-1981; Ord. No. 5936, § 1, 6-21-1982; Ord. No. 6127, § 1, 6-20-1983; Ord. No. 8084, § 1, 6-28-1990; Ord. No. 9322, § 1, 6-24-1991; Ord. No. 10764, § 1, 6-17-1996) 
Sec. 70-54. - Sewer rental with reference to property using water from source other than city water supply. 
    From a property which uses water, all or a part of which is from a source other than the city's water supply system, there shall be a sewer rental, separate from and in addition to any sewer rental based on the consumption of water from the city's water supply system. Such separate or additional sewer rental shall be measured by the quantity of water from the source other than the city's water supply system, which is discharged into the city's sewers from such property. The owner of such property shall install, without cost to the city, a meter to measure the quantity of water received from a source other than the city's water supply system and discharged into the city's sewers. No meters shall be installed or be used for such purposes without the approval of the city engineer. The owner of such property shall pay for such water so discharged into the city's sewers an amount as though all such water came from the city's water supply system. If the owner of such property fails to install and maintain, at his or her own expense, an approved meter, the director shall make an estimate of the amount of water from sources other than the city water supply system which is discharged into the city's sewers from such property, using the consumption from similar operations, and if none, a formula based upon the operations of the business of the occupant of the premises as a standard, and bill such estimated water so discharged into the city's sewer as though the same were metered. 
(Code 1964, § 18-35; Code 1982, § 23-44; Ord. No. 7773, § 1, 3-20-1989) 
Sec. 70-55. - Sewer rental with reference to property using city water for industrial or commercial purpose and not discharging same into city sewer system. 
    Whenever a property upon which a sewer rental is hereby imposed uses water from the city's water supply system for an industrial or commercial purpose so that the water so used is not discharged into the sewerage system of the city, the quantity of the water so used and not discharged into the city's sewers shall be excluded in determining the sewer rental of such property; provided, that the quantity of water so used and not discharged into the city's sewers is measured by a device approved by the city engineer and installed and maintained without cost to the city; and, provided, that the water supply of such property is metered and the owner pays for such water at metered rates. The sewer rental based upon the consumption of city water to be paid by the owner of such property shall be computed at the rates established for sewer service and using a quantity of water equal to the total quantity of water furnished such property by the city, less a quantity not discharged into the city's sewer; provided, however, that where in the opinion of the city engineer it is not practical to install a measuring device to determine continuously the quantity of water not discharged into the city's sewers, the city engineer shall determine periodically, in such way and by such method as he or she may prescribe, the quantity of metered water discharged into the city's sewers, and the quantity of water used to determine the sewer rental shall be the portion so determined of the quantity measured by water meter. Any dispute as to the estimated amount shall be submitted to the city manager whose decision on the matter shall be final. 
(Code 1964, § 18-36; Code 1982, § 23-45; Ord. No. 7773, § 1, 3-20-1989) 
Sec. 70-56. - Installation and maintenance of meters required under sections 70-54 and 70-55. 
    All meters or other measuring devices installed or required to be installed under the provisions of sections 70-54 and 70-55 shall be under the control of the city engineer. The owner of the property upon which a measuring device is installed shall be responsible for its maintenance and safekeeping and all repairs thereto shall be made at the owner's cost. 
(Code 1964, § 18-37; Code 1982, § 23-46; Ord. No. 7773, § 1, 3-20-1989) 
Sec. 70-57. - Payment of water, sewer and stormwater bills. 
(a)  All bills due the city for water, sewer and stormwater service shall be payable within 21 days after the date of issue. The sending of a bill via U.S. postal service or e-mail to the consumer shall be the notice required by the city Charter. Effective July 1, 2016, all bills not satisfied within 21 days after the date of issue shall be charged the greater of $5.00 or interest thereafter at a rate of one percent per month. If any bill remains unpaid for a period of 10 days after the due date, the city shall send, either via US postal service or e-mail, a notice to the delinquent customer stating that if the entire amount of the delinquent balance is not paid within seven calendar days of the issuance of this notice the service shall be terminated. Where stormwater service charges are being paid by the owner of property or other designated customer who is not the occupant and water and/or sewer charges are being paid by the occupant of property, water and sewer service will not be terminated on account of unpaid stormwater charges unless the city has sent the occupant notice of the unpaid stormwater service charge and possible utility termination at least 30 days prior to the termination. 
(b)  if payment of the delinquent amount is not received by the date and time specified in the delinquency notice, charge shall be added to the customer's account to defray the city's collection costs. For the purpose of this section, such a charge shall be termed a " delinquency charge." The delinquency charge shall be set by the city council from time to time. For sewer only accounts a service delinquency charge shall be set by the city council from time to time to offset the city's costs to discontinue and reestablish sewer service as necessary. A delinquency charge may be waived by a supervisor in the interest of equity where the customer has not had a prior delinquency fee assessed and there is an underlying or contributing cause beyond the reasonable control of the customer. 
(c)  The city may extract a water meter or water meter yoke at the discretion of the city manager in order to enforce the payment of delinquent amounts. Such extractions shall be made if the account has demonstrated a history of attempted payment by worthless check, repeated disconnection for nonpayment, or similar occurrence. The city may also extract a water meter and/or water meter yoke at the discretion of the city manager where there has been an unauthorized connection or reconnection of water service, whether by an unauthorized turn-on of the meter or by use of an unauthorized meter or other unauthorized device. In the event of an extraction, the customer shall be charged the service charge as set by city council and an additional charge as set by city council for extraction of the water meter. An additional charge as set by city council shall be made for extraction of the water meter yoke to defray the city's cost, when necessary. In the event that the extraction of a water meter and water meter yoke are circumvented through unauthorized means, the service may be crimped, removed or otherwise discontinued. When discontinuance of service by crimping or removal is necessary, the customer shall be charged all above charges and an additional charge as set by city council to defray the cost of restoration of the service. 
    The city may install a valve and cleanout at the lateral of sewer customers in order to disconnect and/or discontinue sewer service at a sewer only account to enforce the payment of delinquent accounts. Such installations shall be made if the account has demonstrated a history of attempted payment by worthless check, repeated nonpayment, or similar occurrence. In the event such an installation is done, the customer shall be charged the fee as set by city council and an. additional charge as set by city council for installation of the valve and cleanout. When discontinuance of service by installation of a valve and cleanout has occurred and the customer requests restoration of service, the customer shall be charged all above charges and an additional charge as set by city council for restoration of the service. 
(d)  The city may engage collection agencies, at the discretion of the city manager, in order to enforce the payment of delinquent accounts. The consumer shall be obligated to pay all costs associated with third-party collection efforts prior to having service resumed at the same location or a new location. 
(e)  The city manager shall have authority to establish administrative procedures for short-term credit extensions where there is a documented short-term inability to pay. Additionally, the city manager shall have authority to create and establish administrative procedures for a hardship fund to provide assistance where there is a documented long-term or permanent inability to pay. Assistance received from the hardship fund may be without financial obligation to the consumer. 
(f)  No customer with a delinquent account may open a new account at another location until the delinquency has been satisfied. 
(g)  A service charge shall be set by city council from time to time to defray the city's cost of making a visit to the location of the customer's service for the purpose of an on-site inspection to check the meter, check for evidence of leaking pipes, or look for malfunctions in the plumbing inside the structure receiving service. No service charge shall be assessed if the visit is in connection with a service charged for under another section of this chapter unless an additional visit is required due to a customer's action or failure to act such as when a fixture is left open at an unoccupied premise when a meter is turned on which requires a return visit after the condition is corrected. No service charge shall be made if the visit results from error by city employees or if the visit reveals a leak from or damage to city infrastructure. No service charge shall be assessed to investigate an issue with sewer service or for an issue with clearly visible water leakage. 
(h)  The city manager may establish administrative policies and procedures under which a standard credit not to exceed an amount set by city council may be granted in the event that water or sewer service is erroneously terminated by the city. This authority is not a guarantee of uninterrupted service, or an admission that the city is responsible for any damages associated with loss of service, nor does it require the city manager to establish or continue such a policy. 
(i)  Order of payment: Where various utility charges appear on a combined utility bill, and a customer does not pay all the outstanding amounts. The partial payment will be applied to the respective charges in the following order: delinquent stormwater charges; delinquent solid waste charges; delinquent miscellaneous charges; delinquent water and/or sewer charges; capital facilities fees; current stormwater charges; current solid waste charges; current miscellaneous charges; and current water and/or sewer charges.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 14333, § 1(Att. 3), adopted October 15, 2012, repealed and reenacted division 2 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, division 2, §§ 70-95-70-108, pertained to water and sewer main extension inside city, and derived from the Code of 1964, §§ 18-43-18-46, 18-49-18-58; the Code of 1982, §§ 23-60-23-73; Ord. No. 7198, § 1, adopted April 21, 1987, and Ord. No. 11369, § 1, adopted March 2, 1998. 

Sec. 70-95. - Extensions authorized. 
(a)  Water and sewer main extensions ("main extensions") and or water and sewer services may be made to serve only properties inside the city or to properties voluntarily annexed into the city, except as provided in division 3 of this article. Sections 70-96 through 70-108 apply to properties that are inside the city prior to seeking a water and sewer main extension, while section 70-109 applies to properties that are outside the city prior to seeking a water and sewer main extension and require voluntary annexation into the city. 
(b)  Where a property inside the city limits is located within 500 feet of an existing water or sewer main that can be extended to serve the property, the property shall extend these mains in accordance with the section 70-96 through 70-108 below and shall not be allowed to receive a well or septic permit from the county health department unless otherwise allowed pursuant to North Carolina State general statutes. Where only one utility exists or is capable of serving the property within 500 feet, the property shall extend those mains to serve the property but shall be allowed well or septic service permits for the unavailable utility.

Sec. 70-96. - Procedure generally. 
    Persons requesting water and sewer extensions to serve properties inside the city ("project") shall: 
(1)  Submit a written application to the city department of water management to request a utility statement. The department of water management shall issue a utility statement for the project that identifies the required utility extensions, upgrades, renovations, force mains and lift stations that will be required to serve the project ("improvements"). The improvements identified in the utility statement will be integrated into the utility extension agreement between the city and developer. The utility extension agreement will govern the terms for the extension of utilities to the project, and in no way shall the utility statement alter the obligations of the parties to a utility extension agreement. The issued utility statement shall be attached to an application for a utility extension agreement (see item (2) below) and concurrently with a petition for annexation if outside the city. The city will charge an application fee for a utility statement. A single family residential house or duplex located on a lot of record, that is not being developed through the subdivision of property, shall be exempt from submitting an application for a utility statement, but shall be required to follow all other requirements of this section. 
(2)  Make written application to the city public works department and the city-county planning department. The city public works department shall create an extension agreement with the applicant with any necessary additional project-specific provisions. Once this is complete, the applicant shall execute an extension agreement with the city and the extension agreement shall be approved by city council. Inside the existing city limits, the requirement of an extension agreement may be waived if the city public works director ("director") or designee determines that there will be no reimbursables associated with the extended utilities. Water and sewer main extensions ("main extensions") and or water and sewer service extensions to serve properties inside the city limits with documented water supplies of unsatisfactory quality or on-site sanitary sewer systems that are a verified health hazard may be executed by the city manager or designee and do not require city council approval; 
(3)  Furnish engineering service plans, maps, surveys, profiles, calculations, etc., for the proposed water and sewer extensions, as required by the director; 
(4)  Obtain all applicable approvals and permits necessary to construct the project; 
(5)  Follow all city codes, ordinances, standards, specifications, and approved plans applicable to the construction of the project; and 
(6)  Meet as built requirements and have streets and required infrastructure opened, graded, and accepted for maintenance by city council and/or NCDOT, if required.

The engineer's designee shall serve each person assessed a civil penalty with a notice of the assessment and the specific reasons therefor by registered or certified mail, or by any means authorized by G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4. The penalty shall be due 35 days after the date of the notice. 
(c)  Remission of civil penalty. Consistent with the limitations in subsection (b) of this section, requests to remit the civil penalty may be resolved by the engineer and the violator. Requests for remission of civil penalties shall be served on the engineer. Remission requests shall not be considered unless served on the engineer within 30 days of the date of the notice of assessment. Remission requests must by accompanied by a waiver of the right to an administrative review hearing of the penalty and a stipulation of the facts on which the assessment was based. If the engineer and the violator are unable to resolve the request, the engineer shall deliver remission requests and the engineers recommended action to the city manager. In determining whether a remission request will be approved, the city manager shall consider the recommendation of the engineer and the following factors: 
(1)  Whether one or more of the civil penalty assessment factors in subsection (b) of this section were wrongly applied to the detriment of the petitioner; 
(2)  Whether the violator promptly abated continuing environmental damage resulting from the violation; 
(3)  Whether the violation was inadvertent or a result of an accident; 
(4)  Whether the violator had been assessed civil penalties for any previous violations; and 
(5)  Whether payment of the civil penalty will prevent payment for the remaining necessary remedial actions. 
The city manager may remit the entire amount of the penalty only when neither the commission nor any entity in its capacity of administering a general permit program pursuant to G.S. 143-215.1(f) has assessed the violator civil penalties for previous violations, and when payment of the civil penalty will prevent payment for the remaining necessary remedial actions. 
(d)  Equitable relief; civil actions; remedies nonexclusive. The city manager is authorized to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, to prevent violations of the terms of a permit or of this division. The city manager is authorized to commence civil actions to collect civil penalties or to seek equitable relief in any appropriate division of the general court of justice in any appropriate county. To the extent allowed by law, the procedures and remedies of civil penalties and actions, including equitable relief, may be used in combination or singly. The city manager shall not commence a civil action to collect a civil penalty until the administrative review has been completed.

Sec. 70-159. - Administrative review; judicial review. 
(a)  Right to administrative review. The following persons are entitled to administrative review: (1) Any applicant denied a permit or any permittee whose permit is made subject to conditions which are unacceptable to the applicant; (2) any permittee that has received notice that its permit has been suspended, revoked, or modified; and (3) any person assessed a civil penalty pursuant to section 70-158(b). Any person entitled to administrative review pursuant to this section shall serve a demand for administrative review to the engineer within 30 days of the date of the notice of the action complained of, or the administrative review shall be deemed waived. The following information must be included in the demand, or the administrative review shall be deemed waived. For the administrative review to consider: 
(1)  The denial of a permit, the applicant must identify separately each reason for denying the permit that the applicant contends to be improper and every basis for such contention; 
(2)  A permit granted subject to unacceptable conditions, the applicant must identify separately each unacceptable condition and every basis for such contention; 
(3)  The modification or revocation of a permit, the permittee must state separately each reason for modifying or revoking the permit that the permittee contends to be improper and every basis for such contention; 
(4)  A civil penalty assessment, the person to whom such penalty was assessed must state separately each reason why such penalty should not be assessed, or if the person contends that the civil penalty was assessed in an improper amount, each reason why the amount of the penalty is improper. 
The person seeking review shall be deemed to have waived the right to raise any reason, basis, or allegedly improper condition that is required to be stated in the demand unless it is specified in the demand. 
(b)  Nature of administrative review; procedure. The administrative review shall include a hearing conducted by a hearing officer, who shall be the engineer or some other unbiased person designated by the engineer. The person seeking review may appear personally and through representatives and may arrange for persons with pertinent knowledge to provide information to the hearing officer. The hearing shall be held and a decision issued by the hearing officer within 90 days of the receipt of the written demand for a hearing. If the hearing is to consider the suspension, modification, or revocation of a permit, the hearing officer shall attempt to hold the hearing and issue a decision within ten days of the receipt of the written demand for a hearing. The hearing officer may affirm, reverse, or modify the action appealed from and shall serve notice of the decision on the person who sought the hearing. When the hearing officer's decision is to deny a permit, to grant a permit with conditions, to modify a permit, to revoke a permit, or to affirm a civil penalty in whole or in part, the person who sought the hearing, in order to complete the administrative review process, shall serve the engineer within ten days of the date of the decision with notice that said person is dissatisfied with the decision. Within 15 days of the service of said notice of dissatisfaction, the hearing officer shall prepare, and the engineer shall serve on said person, findings with respect to the decision. The hearing officer's decision, including findings if any, shall constitute the final decision of the city for purposes of administrative review. 
(c)  Rules. The engineer may propose rules concerning the conduct of the hearing that is provided pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and concerning any other matter associated with the hearing. The rules shall become effective upon approval by the city manager. 
(d)  Transcript of administrative review hearing. The hearing officer may, and if requested by the person seeking review shall, provide for any part of the hearing to be recorded. The hearing officer may select audio, video, or writing as the means of recording. A transcript of any hearing, or part thereof, which is recorded need not be prepared unless requested. If the person seeking review requests that a transcript be prepared, the engineer shall arrange for the preparation, and the person seeking review shall bear the preparation cost. If a transcript is prepared, a licensed court reporter shall prepare the transcript, unless all parties and the engineer agree otherwise. The engineer shall require the person seeking review to post an advance deposit sufficient to defray said cost. If the person seeks judicial review pursuant to section 42-159(e), said person shall provide the original transcript to the engineer at no cost to the city. 
(e)  Judicial review. Any person who had a right to administrative review pursuant to section 42-159(a) may petition for judicial review, but only after having exhausted administrative review, including giving a notice of dissatisfaction and receiving findings. For purposes of the right to petition for judicial review, making a remission request pursuant to section 70-158(c) shall not be considered part of administrative review. When the hearing officer's decision is to deny a permit or grant it with conditions, or to affirm a civil penalty in whole or in part, service of a notice of dissatisfaction shall be considered part of administrative review. If the person made a request for remission of a civil penalty pursuant to section 70-158(c), there shall be no judicial review of the civil penalty. Judicial review shall be obtained by filing a written petition within 30 days after the service by the engineer of the findings which the hearing officer issued regarding the action complained of, but not thereafter, with the superior court of Durham County. The petition shall specifically and with particularity state the grounds for claiming that the decision of the hearing officer is contrary to law. If not previously requested, said person shall request in writing, at or before the date of filing the petition with the superior court, that a transcript be prepared for every part of the administrative hearing that was recorded. A copy of the petition shall be served on the city in the manner required by law. Within 30 days after service of a copy of the petition upon the city or such other time as may be ordered by the court, the city shall prepare and transmit to the court the original or a certified copy of the official record of the hearing as hereinafter set forth. Unless the city manager and the persons seeking judicial review agree otherwise, the official record of the administrative hearing shall include: 
(1)  The documents presented by the petitioner at the administrative hearing; 
(2)  The documents considered by the hearing officer in reaching the decision complained of; 
(3)  The decision and findings of the hearing officer; and 
(4)  The transcript of each part of the hearing that was recorded, if available at the time the remaining portion of the official record is transmitted to the court. If the transcript is not available at that time, it shall be transmitted to the court as soon as reasonably possible after the transcript has been prepared. 
The court may consider the official record, the City Code of the city, and the city standards, and shall not consider additional evidence. Except to the extent otherwise required by law, the judicial review shall be limited to contentions properly raised in the administrative review, and the court shall remand the decision for appropriate further proceedings if the court finds the decision is: (1) in violation of constitutional provisions, (2) in excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the city, (3) made upon unlawful procedure, (4) affected by other error of law, (5) unsupported by substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted, the City Code, and the city standards, or (6) arbitrary and capricious. The city manager shall have the authority to settle and compromise, on behalf of the city, any of said proceedings filed in the superior court.

    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants and wastewater discharges into the municipal wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge; 
(2)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants and wastewater discharges into the municipal wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into any waters of the state or otherwise be incompatible with the system; 
(3)  To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludges from the municipal system; 
(4)  To protect both municipal personnel who may be affected by sewage, sludge, and effluent in the course of their employment as well as protecting the general public; 
(5)  To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance and improvement of the municipal wastewater system; and 
(6)  To ensure that the municipality complies with its NPDES or non-discharge permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any other federal or state laws to which the municipal wastewater system is subject. 
    This article provides for the regulation of direct and indirect contributors to the municipal wastewater system, through the issuance of permits to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires user reporting and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein. 
    This article shall apply to all users of the municipal wastewater system, as authorized by G.S. 160A-312 and/or 153A-275. The city shall designate an administrator of the publicly owned treatment works or POTW and pretreatment program hereafter referred to as the director. Except as otherwise provided herein, the director shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article. Any powers granted to or imposed upon the director may be delegated by the director to other city personnel. By discharging wastewater into the municipal wastewater system, industrial users located outside the city limits agree to comply with the terms and conditions established in this article, as well as any permits, enforcement actions, or orders issued hereunder.

Sec. 70-341. - Administrative remedies. 
    The director may utilize any or all of the following actions, singly or in combination for violations of this article and permits issued under authority of this article. Unless specifically provided herein, none of these remedies is a requisite to the director utilizing any other remedy. In addition, the use of these remedies does not limit the city's right to use any other remedy provided for under this article, state or federal law, or common law. 
(1)  Notice of violation. Whenever the director finds that any user or industrial user has violated or is violating this article, wastewater permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained therein or any other pretreatment requirement the director may serve upon such a person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days from the date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city by the user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(2)  Consent orders. The director is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order issued pursuant to this article. 
(3)  Show cause proceeding. The director may order any user or industrial user who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this article or is in noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The director shall notify the user specifying the time and place for the proceeding, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the proceeding shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days before the proceeding. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
The director shall review the information presented at the proceeding and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate. A show cause proceeding under this section is not a prerequisite to the assessment of a civil penalty nor is any action or inaction taken by the director under this section subject to an administrative appeal. 
(4)  Administrative orders. When the director finds that a user or industrial user has violated or is violating this article, permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement the director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to do any of the following: 
a.  Immediately comply with all requirements; 
b.  Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in the order; 
c.  Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a continuing or threatened violation; 
d.  Disconnect water and/or sewer service unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified time period. 
(5)  Emergency suspensions. The director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit. 
Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. An informal hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user's waste discharge permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The director shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the director prior to the date of the above-described hearing. 
(6)  Termination of permit or permission to discharge. The director may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
a.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge; 
b.  Failure to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
c.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or 
d.  Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to discharge, conditions of this article, or any applicable state and federal regulations. 
Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under why the proposed action should not be taken.

Sec. 70-578. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. 
    Accessible (Access to) means capable of being reached for testing and maintenance, however, it first may require the removal of an access panel, door, dirt, sod, or similar obstruction. 
    Air gap means an unobstructed physical separation sufficient to prevent backflow between the free flowing end of a drinking water supply system and any other system. Physically, an approved air gap is defined as a distance that is at least twice the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically to the overflow rim of the receiving vessel, but never less than one inch. 
    Approved means meeting the standards for cross connections or certified in writing as acceptable by the cross connection control administrator, provided that such certifications cannot contradict the standards. 
    Atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB) means a device that prevents backsiphonage by creating an atmospheric vent when there is either negative pressure or subatmospheric pressure in a water system. It includes those devices permanently attached to a hose bibb ("hose bibb vacuum breaker"). 
    Auxiliary intake means a piping connection or device whereby water may be secured from a source other than the city's drinking water supply (e.g., well). 
    Backflow means the reversal of flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances, under positive or reduced pressure in the city's drinking water distribution system, that flows from any source other than its intended public source, or such flow in the user's drinking water distribution system. 
    Backflow permit means a document issued by the department that authorizes a particular action or use of a particular backflow preventer or other device. 
    Backflow preventer means a device or method designed to prevent backflow or backsiphonage. Common categories of backflow preventers are: air gap, reduced pressure principle assembly, reduced pressure detector assembly, double check valve assembly, double check detector assembly, pressure vacuum breaker, atmospheric vacuum breaker, and hose bibb vacuum breaker. 
    Backpressure means a condition in which the pressure in the user's drinking water supply system is greater than the city's drinking water supply system pressure which can cause a reversal of the normal direction of flow. 
    Backsiphonage means the flowing back of used or contaminated water from a plumbing fixture or vessel into the pipe which feeds it, caused by reduced pressure in the pipe. 
    Certified tester means a person who meets applicable state requirements for inspecting, testing, and repairing backflow preventers and, in addition, meets city requirements, which include successful completion of a training program approved by the director, and performance of work that meets standards. 
    Containment means preventing backflow that can affect the city drinking water supply system through installation of a backflow preventer directly downstream of the water meter or other point of water service connection before any branching occurs within the user's drinking water supply system. 
    Contamination means affecting the quality of drinking water supplied by the city so as to negatively impact the quality of the drinking water or present a hazard to public health. 
    Cross-connection or cross connection means any actual or potential connection or structural arrangement between the drinking water supply system (whether the city's or a user's) and a source of potential contamination. 
    Cross-connection control administrator means the official in the department designated by the director to perform certain functions with regard to administration of the city's program for controlling cross connections and installing backflow preventers. 
    Department means the city's department of water management. 
    Director means the director of the department of water management. The director may delegate any functions under this article to one or more designees. 
    Double check detector assembly means an assembly consisting of two approved double check valve assemblies installed as one unit. One of those assemblies is smaller than the other and is installed as a protected bypass around the main backflow preventer. The bypass branches out of the body of the larger assembly immediately after the inlet shut-off valve, and it terminates in the body of the larger backflow preventer immediately before its outlet shut-off valve. The bypass contains a specific water meter (reading in cubic feet) that detects small flows. The maximum pressure loss through the assembly cannot exceed ten pounds per square inch under normal flow conditions. 
    Double check valve assembly or double check valve assembly preventer (each may be referred to as a DCVA) means an assembly containing two single, spring-loaded, independently operating check valves with tightly closing shut-off valves on each side of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of each check valve. 
    Drinking water supply system means the piping that distributes water meeting potable water standards and supplied by the city. If the system is on the street side of a water meter, the system is the "city drinking water supply system" and if it is on the user's side of the water meter it is the "user's drinking water supply system." 
    Dual check valve device means a device that contains two spring-loaded, independently operating check valves in series, without tightly closing shut off valves and test cocks. These are generally used immediately downstream of the city water meter as a containment device. 
    Fire line means a system of pipes and equipment for a fire system. A system of pipes and equipment used to supply water in an emergency for extinguishing fire. 
    Hose bibb means an outside spigot or faucet located on the exterior of a building. 
    In-Ground means below ground or below finished grade; including but not limited to below concrete, sod, mulch, or sand. An in-ground piping system is any in-ground piping, sprinklers, drip tubing, valve, control wiring of 30 volts or less, and associated components, thereby making the in-ground piping not readily accessible (defined below). 
    Irrigation. See irrigation system. 
    Irrigation contractor means any person who, for compensation or other consideration, constructs, installs, expands, services, or repairs irrigation systems. An irrigation contractor, who is not a licensed plumber, may only perform work downstream of a backflow preventer. 
    Irrigation system means all piping, fittings, sprinklers, drip tubing, valves, control wiring of 30 volts or less, and associated components installed for the delivery and application of water for the purpose of irrigation. 
    Isolation means isolating a localized hazard at the point of use from the drinking water system so that it does not affect the remainder of the internal drinking water system. 
    Plumbing permit shall have the same meaning as it has in the North Carolina State Building Code. 
    Pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) means a device containing an independently operating spring-loaded check valve and an independently operating spring-loaded air inlet valve located on the discharge side of the check valve. The device includes properly located test cocks for testing the proper operation of the check valve and air inlet as well as tightly closing shut-off valves located at each end of the assembly. 
    Readily accessible (ready access) means that which enables piping. fittings, sprinklers, drip tubing, valves, control wiring of 30 volts or less, and associated components to be directly reached without requiring the removal or movement of any panel, door, dirt, concrete, sod, mulch, sand or other obstruction similar to those included in this list. 
    Reduced pressure detector assembly (RPDA) means an assembly consisting of two approved reduced pressure backflow prevention assemblies installed as one unit. One of those assemblies is smaller than the other and is installed as a protected bypass around the main backflow preventer. The bypass branches out of the body of the main assembly immediately after the inlet shut-off valve, and it terminates in the body of the main backflow preventer before its outlet shut-off valve. The bypass contains a specific water meter (reading in cubic feet) that detects small flows. The type of backflow preventer in the bypass assembly is the same type as the main backflow preventer, thus providing the same level of protection in both branches. The RPDA is often used on a fire sprinkler system or an extended fire hydrant line. 
    Reduced pressure principle assembly (RPZ) means an assembly containing two spring-loaded independently operating check valves, with an automatically operating pressure differential relief valve located between the two check valves, plus tightly closing shut off values on each side of the check valves, and properly located test cocks for testing the check valves. 
    Standards mean those written requirements issued and maintained by the department that meet, at a minimum, the requirements of law. The standards shall be maintained in a document available in paper and online which may bear any title, including "manual," "requirements," or "guidelines." 
    User means any person that occupies or owns property that receives water from the city drinking water system, whether or not the property is located within the city limits.

ARTICLE VIII. - STORMWATER UTILITY 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 70-630. - Findings. 
(a)  Stormwater poses a threat to the public health, safety, and welfare because it floods properties, erodes watercourses and channels, and pollutes streams and rivers. 
(b)  By mapping, planning, constructing, operating, cleaning, regulating and maintaining natural and constructed stormwater management facilities, the city reduces the adverse effects of stormwater and improves the quality of groundwater, streams, rivers, and lakes in and around the city. 
(c)  Providing a stable source of funding for the activities heretofore described can best be accomplished through the creation of a stormwater utility. Such a utility will benefit owners and occupants of developed land in the city and other citizens. 
(d)  The amount of impervious surface on a property is the single most important factor affecting the peak rate of runoff, the total volume discharged, and pollutant loadings of stormwater that flows from property. It is equitable to fund a stormwater utility through a system in which service charges are based on the amount of impervious surface on developed land. 
(Code 1982, § 23-200; Ord. No. 11083, § 1, 4-23-1997) 
Sec. 70-631. - Definitions applicable to article. 
    All definitions found elsewhere in this chapter apply in this article, in addition to the ones below, unless the context of the article language clearly indicates otherwise. The city engineer is authorized to interpret and to apply these definitions. If a property could be interpreted to fall into more than one category the city engineer shall determine the applicable category. 
    Customer or consumer means the person or entity to which a bill for stormwater service charges is sent. This may include the owner, occupant, or tenant of property, a homeowners' association with responsibility for property or for common areas associated with property, or a person or entity who has requested in writing to be billed for stormwater service charges for a property. 
    Developed land means property that contains impervious surface, and includes improved land without structures and land on which improvements are under construction, with the exception of city streets. 
    Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) is 2,400 square feet of impervious surface, which is the average amount of impervious surface on a single family property in the city. 
    Impervious surface means a surface which, because of its composition or compacted nature, impedes or prevents natural infiltration of water into the soil, including, but not limited to, roofs, solid decks, driveways, patios, sidewalks, parking areas, tennis courts, concrete or asphalt streets, or compacted gravel surfaces. Wooden slatted decks and the water area of swimming pools are considered pervious. 
    Other residential and nonresidential land means any developed land not fitting the definition of a residential unit. It includes, but is not limited to, land upon which there are residential structures that contain more than two units, such as triplexes, townhouses, condominiums, apartments, boardinghouses; churches; institutional buildings, whether public or private; commercial, office, and industrial buildings; parking lots, driveways, and private streets; and land containing improvements under construction or impervious surfaces that are not structures, with the exception of city streets. 
    Property owner or owner means the owner of a parcel of land as shown on the county tax records. 
    Residential unit means a detached single-family house, a duplex, or a manufactured home or mobile home located on an individual lot or parcel of land rather than in a manufactured home park. 
    Stormwater means the runoff from precipitation that travels over natural or developed surfaces to the nearest stream, other conduit, or impoundment and appears in lakes, rivers, ponds, or other bodies of water. 
    Stormwater services means the city program for protection of stormwater quality and for the partial control and conveyance of stormwater. It includes, without limitation, public education; monitoring, removing, and regulating stormwater pollutants; other activities described in the state-issued NPDES permit; mapping; planning; regulating, reviewing and inspecting private stormwater infrastructure; and operating, cleaning, and maintaining the city's stormwater system. The existence of stormwater services does not extend the city's ownership or responsibility to portions of the stormwater system that are privately owned, nor does it allow the city to control the conveyance of stormwater so as to prevent property damage from flooding. 
    Stormwater system or drainage system means the system of natural and constructed conveyances for collecting and transporting stormwater, whether publicly or privately owned. It includes lakes, ponds, rivers, perennial and intermittent streams, connected wetlands, open ditches, catch basins and other inlets, pipes, sewers, drains, culverts, and, in addition, created stormwater management facilities that provide partial treatment by passive means such as wet detention ponds, detention basins, and stormwater wetlands. 
    Stormwater utility funds mean the stormwater service charges and the interest generated by those charges.

DIVISION 2. - ESTABLISHMENT OF STORMWATER SERVICE CHARGES AND CREDITS 

Sec. 70-651. - Creation of stormwater account; activities of the stormwater services division. 
    Stormwater service charges and interest generated by such charges shall be placed in a separate city account and shall be used by the city solely for the operational costs, indirect costs, debt principal and debt service, and establishment of a reserve fund for stormwater services. 
(Code 1982, § 23-202; Ord. No. 11083, § 1, 4-23-1997; Ord. No. 12039, § 2, 8-21-2000; Ord. No. 12968, § 1, 6-21-2004) 
Sec. 70-652. - Stormwater service charges. 
    All developed land in the city, whether public or private, shall be subject to a stormwater service charge set by the city council. Exemptions shall not be allowed based on age, tax exemption, or other status of an individual or organization. Service charges may be subject to a credit system as further provided in this article. 
(Code 1982, § 23-203; Ord. No. 11083, § 1, 4-23-1997; Ord. No. 12968, § 1, 6-21-2004) 
Sec. 70-653. - Billing method, responsible parties. 
(a)  Bills for stormwater service shall be sent at regular, periodic intervals, which may range from monthly to yearly. In the event that annual billing is utilized, the public works department shall develop policies that allow more frequent billing of residential customers based on hardship, nonpayment, or other relevant circumstances. Stormwater service charges may be billed on a combined utility bill that also contains charges for water and/or sewer service. Stormwater service charges that are shown on a combined utility bill may be for a different service period than that used for water and/or sewer service. 
(b)  Stormwater service bills for a property that receives water and/or sewer service may be sent to the customer receiving such service. However, where multiple water and sewer accounts exist for a single parcel, the stormwater service bill may be sent to the property owner. Additional guidelines concerning billing will be developed by the city. 
(c)  The property owner is ultimately responsible for payment of the stormwater service charge for property for which the party billed has not paid the service charge. 
(d)  Owners and occupants of property may designate which party shall receive the stormwater service bill by completing and properly executing a form provided by the city. Such transfer does not relieve either the owner or occupant from liability for stormwater service charges if they are not paid by the party billed. 
(e)  Townhouse and condominium developments and other similar properties containing impervious surface in common ownership shall be charged for the total impervious surface of all commonly-owned property within the development. The stormwater service bill for the commonly-owned property within the development shall be sent to the homeowners' association. Individually-owned property within the development shall be billed at the residential Tier 1 rate for each individual parcel and the stormwater service bill shall be sent to the owner of each individual parcel. 
(Code 1982, § 23-204; Ord. No. 11083, § 1, 4-23-1997; Ord. No. 13785, § 1, 4-20-2009; Ord. No. 13840, § 1, 6-15-2009; Ord. No. 14128, § 1, 5-16-2011) 
Sec. 70-654. - Payment provisions, utility termination. 
(a)  Where stormwater service charges appear on a combined utility bill, and a customer does not pay the service charges for all the utilities on the bill, the partial payment will be applied to the respective service charges in the following order: delinquent stormwater charges; delinquent water and/or sewer charges; capital facilities fees; current stormwater charges; current water and/or sewer charges. 
(b)  Stormwater service charges are due at the collection office in city hall within 21 days after a bill has been issued. Bills not paid within this time shall be charged interest at the rate of one percent per month. 
(c)  Where a property receives water and/or sewer service, if stormwater service charges for that property are not paid, water and/or sewer service to that property may be terminated, whether or not the stormwater charges were included on a combined utility bill. Termination will be handled in accordance with sections 70-57, 70-58, and 70-59 regarding notice, appeal, and termination of utility service. Where stormwater service charges have not been included on a combined utility bill for a property, water and/or sewer service to that property will not be terminated unless the city has sent the occupant notice of the unpaid stormwater service charge and possible utility termination at least 30 days prior to the termination. 
(d)  No property for which stormwater service charges are outstanding is entitled to receive water and/or sewer service until the outstanding stormwater service charge on that property is paid. No customer with a delinquent stormwater service account is entitled to open a water and/or sewer account at the same or different location until the delinquency has been satisfied. 
(e)  If property is incorrectly billed, or not billed, or a bill is sent to the wrong party, the city may backbill a property for up to a three-year period. 
(f)  Customers with complaints about the accuracy of stormwater service charges are entitled to a review as provided in section 70-58. No charge will be adjusted unless the complaining customer has filed a written complaint with the city within one year of the date the city first sent the customer notice of the charge. 
(Code 1982, § 23-205; Ord. No. 11083, § 1, 4-23-1997) 
Sec. 70-655. - Credits. 
(a)  The city may provide a system of credits against stormwater service charges for properties on which stormwater facility construction or maintenance substantially mitigates the peak discharge or runoff pollution flowing from such properties or substantially decreases the city's cost of maintaining the public stormwater system. The engineering department will develop written policies to implement the credit system. The amount of credit for maintenance may be limited to properties that have a specified minimum impervious surface area. The city's policies may make credits retroactive to the date stormwater service charges were initiated. 
(b)  A 100 percent credit, conditioned upon the continued maintenance of the drainage systems on such properties to city standards, shall be provided to the following properties: 
(1)  Improved public roads, not including internal roads within public facilities, which have been conveyed to and accepted for maintenance by the North Carolina Department of Transportation and which are used by the public for motor vehicle transportation; and 
(2)  Railroad corridors and tracks. 
(c)  The above credits are provided in recognition of the use and utility of the above properties as corridors with independently, regularly improved and maintained drainage systems that pass through numerous private and public properties and that collect and control the drainage through those properties.

Footnotes: 
--- (8) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 13948, § 2, adopted December 21, 2009, repealed and reenacted division 3 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, division 3, §§ 70-684-70-689, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from the Code of 1982, §§ 23-210-23-214; Ord. No. 11083, § 1, adopted April 23, 1997, and Ord. No. 12039, §§ 3-5, adopted August 21, 2000.  Section 3 of Ord. No. 13948 states the following: This ordinance shall become effective upon adoption. Notwithstanding this effective date, active drainage assistance projects for which the city has developed project scopes and estimates of probable cost prior to January 1, 2010 may be completed under the terms of the Code sections repealed by the enactment of this ordinance. 

Sec. 70-684. - Purpose and definitions. 
(a)  Purpose. This division establishes the conditions under which funds from the stormwater utility will be used for work on drainage system components located outside the city-owned drainage system or within city-owned rights-of-way. Drainage system components located within city-owned rights-of-way play an essential function in carrying stormwater and the public impact when such components malfunction is generally greater than when such components are located outside the rights-of-way. Therefore, the first priority use of stormwater utility funds is for maintenance of and improvements to drainage system components within city-owned rights-of-way. Stormwater utility funds may also be used to fund drainage system construction, improvement, repair, or maintenance on property outside of city rights-of-way. The city has an interest in helping to assure that components of the drainage system that have an impact on the overall system are maintained and/or improved, whether located inside or outside city rights-of-way. Such components are generally those that carry in whole or in part runoff from publicly maintained streets. 
    The intent of this section is not to transfer responsibility or liability to the city for drainage system components on property not owned by the city that carry such runoff. Rather, it is to establish criteria and priorities to be used when making available stormwater utility funds for work on drainage system components located outside of city-owned rights-of-way. No action or inaction of the city pursuant to this section shall impose upon the city, its agents, officers, or employees, any responsibility or liability of any kind, past or future, relating to any person or property. No action by the city, including but not limited to funding of work on drainage system components not owned by the city, shall be considered as a taking or appropriation of, or assumption of responsibility for any stream, drain, ditch or other drainage system feature that is outside city-owned property or right-of-way. 
    City participation in work on drainage system components outside of the right-of-way is limited to the extent to which funds are available for such purpose and no entitlement to receive funds for such work arises from this division. 
(b)  Definitions. In addition to definitions previously appearing in division 1 of this article, the definitions below also apply to this division. Interpretation and application of this division shall be by the director of public works, whose decisions are final and not subject to appeal. 
    Director means the city's director of the department of public works or any successor department in which primary responsibility for administering the stormwater services resides, and includes any individual to whom the director delegates responsibilities under this article. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland waters and/or, the rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Public street means an area for vehicular traffic that is maintained by the city or North Carolina Department of Transportation and is within publicly owned right-of-way. 
    Routine maintenance means activities that allow the drainage system to function properly by keeping it clean and free of blockage. It does not include construction or major repair. Examples include but are not limited to, cleaning grates and inlets, flushing pipes, removing blockages in pipes, removing litter and debris from channels and ditches, minor clearing of overgrown vegetation and minor repair of erosion control measures. 
(Ord. No. 13948, § 2, 12-21-2009) 
Sec. 70-685. - Criteria for use of stormwater utility funds for drainage assistance projects located outside of city-owned rights-of-way. 
(a)  Work on drainage projects may be funded with stormwater utility funds provided that all of the following eligibility criteria are met: 
(1)  The drainage system carries, in whole or in part, runoff from public streets. 
(2)  The property on which the drainage system is located has not received any credit under section 70-655 for stormwater service utility charges within the preceding five years. 
(3)  The drainage system is not part of a water quality treatment facility or water quantity control device that was required to be constructed and maintained as part of an approved development. 
(4)  The drainage system is not located on property which is undergoing development or redevelopment unless the development/redevelopment project is funded in part by other city funds. 
(5)  The condition of the drainage system must impact or threaten an existing inhabited or occupied building or a public street, sidewalk, or other public pedestrian walkway. 
Conditions that do not qualify include but are not limited to: 
 Moisture or ponding not attributable to flooding; 
 Groundwater seepage; 
 Landscaping;

(h)  Fees. The city is authorized to charge fees to recoup all estimated direct and indirect costs of administering this article, and such fees shall be reviewed and approved on a periodic basis by the city council. 
(i)  Severability. If any portion of this article is determined to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such determination shall not affect or invalidate the remaining portions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 14274, § 1, 6-4-2012) 
Sec. 70-738. - Peak runoff control requirements. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure that the increases in volume, velocity, and peak flow of stormwater discharges from development are addressed, in order to mitigate the impacts on downstream properties and receiving waters. All development, including development that may be exempt from pollutant reduction requirements set forth in remaining sections of this article, is subject to the requirements of this section unless exempted in subsection (b) below. 
(b)  Applicability; calculation of prior impervious area. This section 70-738 applies to the following development, assessed in comparison to pre-development prior impervious conditions as defined in subsections (1) and (2) below: (i) relocation of existing impervious area on a multifamily and other lot; (ii) increase in impervious area on any lot subject to limitations on impervious area in an approved plat or plan for reasons such as watershed protection or stormwater control measure requirements; (iii) increase of more than 200 square feet in impervious area on a multifamily and other lot; (iv) increase of more than 2,000 square feet of impervious area on a limited residential lot. For purposes of calculating these thresholds, subject development that is part of a common plan of development shall be assessed with other portions of such common plan that have not previously complied with peak flow requirements. 
(1)  For purposes of applying peak flow requirements for the two- and ten-year storms, the land cover (including type and location) existing as of April 23, 1997 shall be considered the "pre-development conditions"; 
(2)  For purposes of applying the peak flow requirement for the one-year storm, the land cover (including type and location) that existed as of March 9, 2001 for land in the Falls Basin and Lower Neuse Basin, and as of March 17, 2009 for land in the Jordan Basin shall be considered the "pre-development conditions"; 
(c)  Requirements. 
(1)  Stormwater impact analysis. Development that is not exempt under subsection (b) above shall submit a stormwater impact analysis or approved alternative to such analysis that complies with city stormwater standards as part of the application for site plan or subdivision plat approval, or if such is not required, as part of submittals for construction drawings or utility permit approval. Calculations shall be made in conformance with city stormwater standards. No subdivision plats, site plans, utility permits, or construction drawings shall be approved in the absence of a determination by the stormwater division that required submissions have been made and approved. 
(2)  One-year storm. Development that increases the peak runoff rate from the one-year storm from pre-development conditions shall provide stormwater management facilities in accordance with city stormwater standards such that there is no net increase in peak runoff rate. 
(3)  Two- and ten-year storms. Development that increases the peak runoff rate from either the two-year or the ten-year storm from predevelopment conditions may be required to provide stormwater management facilities to address the impact, as determined in accordance with city stormwater standards. 
(4)  Other design storms. Development that increases the peak runoff from other design storms such as the 100-year storm may be required to install stormwater management facilities to address the impact, as determined in accordance with city stormwater standards. 
(Ord. No. 14274, § 1, 6-4-2012) 
Sec. 70-739. - Stormwater pollutant standards; exemptions. 
    Sections 70-739 through 70-741 set forth requirements for stormwater pollutants, which include nitrogen, phosphorus, total suspended solids, and bacteria. All development shall comply with these standards unless exempted as set forth in this section. 
(1)  Exemptions for limited disturbances. Development in which land disturbance, calculated cumulatively as of the applicable baseline date, is less than the thresholds in Table 1 below is exempt from the standards in sections 70-740 and 70-741, subject to paragraphs a. and b. below. 
Table 1 
Thresholds for Application of Stormwater Pollutant Requirements 
Project Location Land Disturbance Limited Residential Multifamily and 
Other Jordan Basin 1 acre 0.5 acre Falls Basin 0.5 acre 12,000 sq. ft. Lower Neuse Basin 1 acre 0.5 acre  
a.  Common plan of development. Development that is part of a common plan of development shall be included in the calculation. If the applicable threshold set forth in Table 1 is exceeded, all other portions of the common plan are subject to the requirements of this article; 
b.  Redevelopment and existing development; maintenance of treatment. Redevelopment and existing development that are exempt under these thresholds must continue to maintain and reconstruct all SCMs in compliance with approved plans, prior ordinance requirements, and city standards. 
(2)  Other exemptions. Additionally, development is exempt if: 
a.  It qualifies in its entirety as existing development; 
b.  It is located in the downtown area and does not increase impervious area over the applicable baseline date; 
c.  It is undertaken by a state or federal entity (Note: Review and approval by the state must be demonstrated); or 
d.  It is a city transportation project in the Jordan basin. 
(Ord. No. 14274, § 1, 6-4-2012) 
Sec. 70-740. - Required reductions for nutrients and TSS; alternatives; calculations. 
(a)  Nutrient loading rate limits. Development not exempt under subsection 70-739 shall construct and implement SCMs so as to limit the post construction loading rate of nitrogen and phosphorus from the project area to the limits set forth in Table 2 below, or shall comply with an allowed alternative as set forth in subsections (b) through (d) below. A portion of the reduction requirements for nitrogen and phosphorus may be met through off site measures or payments as set forth in section 70-741. 
Table 2 
Nutrient Export Loading Rate Limits 
Project Location Export Limit lbs/acre/year Nitrogen Phosphorus Jordan Basin 2.2 0.82 Falls Basin 2.2 0.33 Lower Neuse Basin 3.6 not required  
(b)  Alternative percentage reduction option for redevelopment that increases impervious area. As an alternative to meeting the loading rate reductions described in subsection (a) above, Redevelopment not exempt under section 70-739 that increases impervious area may reduce the pre-development nutrient loading rate from the entire project site for nitrogen and phosphorus by the percentage loading rate reduction shown in Table 3 below. The pre-development nutrient loading rate is calculated as of the applicable baseline date. Load reductions already achieved shall be credited.

Percentage Reduction Option for Redevelopment 
Project Location Percent Loading Rate Reduction from Pre-Dev Loading Rate N P Jordan 35% 5% Falls 40% 77% Lower Neuse 30% N/A  
(c)  Alternative percentage reduction option for redevelopment that does not increase impervious area. Redevelopment not exempt under section 70-739 that is outside the downtown area and that does not increase impervious area shall reduce the-pre-development nutrient loading rate, calculated as of the applicable baseline date, by 10% if reductions are achieved entirely onsite, and by 15% if reductions cannot be entirely achieved onsite. Table 4 is not applicable to this alternative. 
(d)  Alternative for low impact development in Falls Basin. Development in the Falls Basin will be considered compliant with the nutrient reduction obligations of this section if it demonstrates that it meets the post development hydrologic criteria set forth in Chapter 2 of the North Carolina Low Impact Development Guidebook dated June of 2009, as it may be amended from time to time. 
(e)  TSS reduction. When the impervious percentage of a development that increases impervious area equals or exceeds 16 percent in the Falls or Jordan Basins, or 24 percent in the Lower Neuse Basin, TSS removal is required as further described in this subsection (e). All impervious surfaces, as reasonably practical, must drain to an SCM that is designed to provide a minimum of 85 percent TSS removal and is sized to capture runoff from the first one inch of rainfall from all surfaces that drain to the SCM. These requirements are expanded, and/or modified as follows: 
(1)  Piped areas in low density projects. Projects that do not require construction of SCMs because their impervious percentage is less than that described in the paragraph above must treat TSS from stormwater runoff that is conveyed in non-vegetated conveyances, such as stormwater pipes, but excluding road and driveway crossings. 
(2)  Overtreatment to address untreatable areas. Where treatment for TSS is not reasonably practicable, as determined by the department, such as when impervious areas include offsite transportation improvements or small noncontiguous areas at the edge of a project, additional reductions of TSS may be required in treatable areas, such as overtreatment in other project areas or treatment of offsite runon. 
(f)  Calculations for nutrient loading and TSS removal. Pollutant loading calculations shall be made using city stormwater standards. All increases in impervious surfaces shall be included, including but not limited internal and off site transportation improvements. Approved methodologies for calculating pollutant loading shall be maintained in writing by the public works department, and shall include those methodologies and calculations required to be used by the division of water quality or DWQ-approved alternate methodologies. 
(g)  Submittals. An applicant shall submit pollutant loading calculations for the pre- and post-development conditions as part of its application for approval of a subdivision or site plan, utility permit, or construction drawings for a street or utility. 
(Ord. No. 14274, § 1, 6-4-2012; Ord. No. 14429, § 1, 4-1-2013) 
Sec. 70-741. - On-site treatment requirements; offsite purchase and credit options; bacteria control. 
(a)  On site nutrient treatment requirements. Nitrogen and phosphorus reduction requirements may be met, in part, through offsite management measures or the purchase of nutrient credits. At a minimum, however, in the Jordan and Falls Basins a percentage of the required nitrogen and phosphorus reductions must be achieved through onsite treatment, in the amount shown in Table 4 below. In addition to meeting the percentage reductions below, in the Jordan and Lower Neuse Basins, nitrogen export loading rates from the site must not exceed six pounds per acre per year for limited residential, and ten pounds per acre per year for multifamily and other (Note: offsite credit purchases do not meet TSS removal requirements which must be met onsite).

* The "required reduction" is the difference between the post development loading in pounds per acre per year multiplied by the site area in acres before treatment minus the loading target, in pounds per acre per year multiplied by the acres. The percentage shown in the chart above is applied to that difference and the resulting number is the amount in pounds/year of nutrient reduction that must be achieved onsite. 
(b)  Offset payments to state approved nutrient mitigation banks. Development and redevelopment shall have the option of purchasing nutrient credits from state-approved nutrient banks to partially offset nitrogen and/or phosphorus loads as allowed by state law and regulation, including but not limited to 15A NCAC 02B.0235, 15A NCAC 02B.0282, and 15A NCAC 02B.0240, as they may be amended from time to time. In the Jordan Basin, calculation of credits required shall reflect state approved delivery factors. The number of pounds for which credits are purchased shall be increased by five percent if the nutrient bank is not located in the city. The following additional requirements shall apply: 
(1)  Location of nutrient banks. Development in the Falls Basin must use nutrient banks located in the upper Falls portion of the Falls Basin-the portion that is north and/or west of Highway 50. Development in the Jordan Basin must use nutrient banks located in the Upper New Hope arm of such basin, as defined in state regulations. 
(2)  Certification of nutrient bank provider. Offset credits may only be obtained from nutrient banks certified by the state. 
(3)  Utilization of NC Ecosystem Enhancement Program. Credits may also be obtained from the NC Ecosystem Enhancement Program if such credits are available, and if applicable state requirements regarding utilization of private nutrient banks are first met. 
(4)  Certification of credits. Credits purchased pursuant to this subsection (b) shall be verified by the state and proof of such verification that meets city requirements shall be presented prior to approval of a final plat, or if no plat is required, prior to issuance of the first building permit within the project, or such earlier deadline as may be required by city stormwater standards. 
(c)  Combination with noncontiguous donor parcels. Development that has met the onsite treatment requirement in section 70-741 may include within the proposed development noncontiguous properties (hereafter "donor parcels") deemed beneficial to water quality by the department and made available for nutrient reduction through an agreement recorded prior to October 1, 2011 that perpetually protects the donor parcels from development. Such parcels must meet the requirements detailed in the public works operating policy on the review criteria for acceptance of conservation easements for non-contiguous donor parcels. Use of donor parcels is also subject to the following additional restrictions: 
(1)  The donor and receiving parcels must be within the same reservoir basin; 
(2)  The donor parcels must be perpetually restricted from development though the recorded legal easement referenced above that can be enforced by the city or County of Durham; 
(3)  Areas within the donor parcels that the department has determined to be undevelopable such as areas within the floodway or within required 50 riparian foot stream buffers may not be used for credit; 
(4)  The amount of credit shall be as determined by the department through a legally binding agreement approved prior to October 1, 2011; 
(5)  All purchases or commitments for use of donor parcels shall be made prior to October 1, 2015. 
(d)  Bacteria removal; control of other identified stormwater pollutants. All development which constructs stormwater control measures in order to comply with this article and which is located in an area that is subject to a state approved total maximum daily load for bacteria shall be required to have at least one SCM for each stormwater discharge that is rated as medium or high for its ability to remove bacteria from stormwater. Ratings shall be those that appear in the most recent version of the NCDENR Stormwater SCM manual or as determined or approved by the director. In addition, SCMs required to be constructed under this article must also treat any other pollutant for which a total maximum daily load has been identified for the area within which the SCM is located. 
(Ord. No. 14274, § 1, 6-4-2012; Ord. No. 14429, § 1, 4-1-2013)

(5)  Performance guarantees. The owner or developer of a development in which the requirements of subsection (4) above have not been completed shall provide a performance guarantee of a type as set forth in city stormwater standards. The amount provided shall be as set forth in city stormwater standards, or as determined by the director, which shall at a minimum require that all direct and indirect costs of completion and compliance with city requirements be guaranteed. City stormwater standards shall also include deadlines for completion of facilities for which performance guarantees have been provided. Deadlines may be modified by the director to better ensure the protection of the city and the public, or to address special circumstances. A performance guarantee provided under this subsection may be used for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by law or the specific terms of such guarantee. 
(6)  Conditional certificates; reduction of guarantees. The city is authorized to issue conditional certificates of compliance for buildings for which stormwater guarantees have been provided and completion ensured consistent with city stormwater standards. In addition, city stormwater standards may allow for reduction of performance guarantees as approved by the department as stormwater facilities are completed and requirements are met. 
(7)  Obligation to complete facilities; city use of land. The owner of property for which a stormwater facility has been approved as part of a development, and any parties that have obligated themselves to construct such facilities under approved plans, permits, or agreements, are legally obligated to construct the facilities approved, or to pay for the construction of such facilities, if any land disturbing activity has occurred in the development. An owner that applies for and receives approval to construct a stormwater facility in a development agrees, without further written agreements or conditions, to allow the city and its agents to enter and construct such facilities and to a reasonable right of entry to such land for the city and its agents, without compensation for such entry or use, to construct facilities required under this article. Such agreement applies to all properties within the development that are conveyed by such owner, and to all persons or entities that utilize an approved plan requiring construction of a stormwater facility for further development. This provision does not: i) require the city to take any action, acquire any property, or construct any facility; or ii) create any right or entitlement for any persons or entities other than the city; or iii) limit the city's ability to require other persons or entities not identified in this subsection (7) to construct stormwater facilities that have not been constructed; or iv) limit the city's ability to utilize any other authority it may have under law to recoup the cost of construction of stormwater facilities, including but not limited to authority to assess properties served by such facilities. 
(8)  Rights under contracts. The city is entitled to enforce any third party rights for the benefit of the public or itself that may be expressly or implicitly created in contracts for the design and construction of SCMs or stormwater conveyances. Contractors that have not performed in accordance with such contracts may be considered responsible parties under this article. 
(Ord. No. 14274, § 1, 6-4-2012)

Sec. 70-751. - Payments to stormwater facility replacement fund; stormwater agreements and covenants. 
    The city shall ensure the continued maintenance, repair, and reconstruction of stormwater facilities through recorded agreements and covenants that meet the provisions of this section and other City Code requirements, and through financial guarantees that ensure that adequate funds are available to provide for the long term maintenance and replacement of facilities. Agreements, covenants, and requirements for type and amount of financial guarantees shall meet the written guidelines or policies of the public works department. These financial guarantees shall be in addition to performance guarantees the city may require to ensure initial construction of stormwater facilities. The department may allow a financial guarantee to be provided through payment to the stormwater facility replacement fund or through provision of an alternate security instrument which shall ensure repair and maintenance for a 20-year period. When accepted by the city, payments to the stormwater facility replacement fund for new facilities that meet department standards for construction and long term ownership and maintenance shall be 25 percent of the construction cost of the stormwater facility, as calculated by the department. Guidelines may allow a reduced payment of up to 50 percent for nonprofit, nongovernmental entities that demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city manager and public works director that the focus of the development project is on low-income housing for physically or mentally challenged persons. The department's written guidelines and policies for stormwater facility agreements and covenants shall ensure the long term maintenance, repair, and reconstruction of the facility by a financially capable owner. Requirements may include, among other things, ownership of other property or buildings in addition to the facility, timely recordation of agreements or covenants regarding responsibilities of future owners, creation of reserve funds, or other measures determined to be useful or necessary to ensure the long term performance and replacement of the facilities. Conversion of security instruments for maintenance and repair of stormwater facilities that are a condition of stormwater agreements entered into by a current or prior owner of a facility may, in the discretion of the department, be converted into payments to the stormwater replacement fund if the facility and provision for long term maintenance, repair, and reconstruction by a financially capable owner meet department requirements. For such facilities, the amount required to be paid into the fund may exceed that required for new facilities if all conditions cannot be met by existing facilities.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 14010, § 1, adopted June 7, 2010, changed the title of section 70-751 from "Payments to stormwater facility replacement fund" to "Payments to stormwater facility replacement fund; stormwater agreements and covenants." The historical notation has been preserved for reference purposes. 
Sec. 70-752. - Loans from stormwater facility replacement fund. 
(a)  Any person who owns a stormwater facility that has paid into the stormwater replacement fund, and that entered into a stormwater facility agreement and covenants with the city may apply for a loan from the fund, where: 
(1)  The stormwater facility has been damaged or destroyed by natural disaster or other catastrophe such that repair or reconstruction costs exceed 75 percent of the original cost of construction adjusted for inflation; 
(2)  Insurance does not provide for the reconstruction of the facility; and 
(3)  The person faces a financial hardship and cannot reasonably provide for the reconstruction of the facility without the benefit of the loan. 
(b)  The city shall determine in its reasonable discretion whether the applicant meets the standards set forth above. 
(c)  The city may loan money from the fund to such person(s) in an amount and for a term and in accordance with other conditions as determined in the reasonable discretion of the city. The term of the loan shall not exceed 15 years and the interest on the loan shall be set at the prevailing prime lending rate as published in the Wall Street Journal. 
(d)  The loan shall be used for the design, engineering, and reconstruction costs of stormwater facilities.

Unless exempted below, a traffic impact analysis (TIA) shall be required for changes of use to determine if roadway improvements will be required, zoning map changes utilizing a development plan, site plans, and preliminary plats that can be anticipated to generate at least 150 vehicle trips at the peak hour (as determined by Institute of Transportation Engineers Standards). Trips generated by separate developments meeting the criteria of paragraph 3.3.3, TIA Submission for Projects with Cumulative Impacts, shall be considered cumulatively.

3.3.2 Exemptions
The following projects shall not be required to submit a TIA:
A. Projects located within the Downtown Tier.
B. Developments that submitted a TIA in conjunction with a zoning map change or previously approved site plan, special use permit, or other plan, where the TIA remains valid, consistent with the provisions of paragraph 3.3.6, Period of Validity.
C. Redevelopment of any site on which the increase in traffic at peak hour represents an increase of less than 150 trips from the previous development, if the redevelopment is initiated within 12 months of the cessation of use of the previous development so long as no access road that leads directly to the site is operating at a level of service worse than the jurisdictions adopted level of service.

3.3.3 TIA Submission for Projects with Cumulative Impacts
A. Unified, Phased, or Otherwise Aggregated Developments
An applicant shall be required to submit a TIA, or obtain a transportation special use permit (TSUP) pursuant to Sec. 3.9, Special Use Permit, for a development plan, site plan, preliminary plat, special use permit, or other similar plan that does not otherwise meet the thresholds for submission of a TIA or for obtaining a TSUP if the development approval is for a project that:
    1. Shares features such as site access or other roadways, design elements, or other infrastructure with nearby unbuilt, but pending developments evidenced by valid, approved site plans or preliminary plats, or active site plan or preliminary plat submittals; and,
    2. When complete, will function in conjunction with such nearby developments as a single project, the impact on the infrastructure of which would exceed the thresholds for preparation of a TIA.
B. Determination
The City Transportation Director, or designee shall determine whether a development application meets the criteria in paragraph A, above, and shall determine whether one TIA shall be required for all of the aggregated development, or whether multiple TIAs may be employed for separate phases of the development.

3.3.4 Pre-Application Conference
The applicant shall schedule a pre-application meeting with the City Transportation Director or designee to discuss procedures, standards, and regulations required for TIA submittal and approval.

3.3.5 Requirements
A. Content
The City Transportation Director or designee shall set forth specific guidelines for preparation of TIAs. A TIA shall, at a minimum, provide the following information:
    1. An estimate of the traffic generated as a result of the proposed development;
    2. An analysis of the existing street system serving the proposed development; and
    3. An assessment of the improvements needed to the existing street system in order to support the traffic anticipated to be generated by the proposed development.
B. Preparer
A TIA shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer with experience in traffic engineering.
C. Sources of Data
Estimates of vehicle trips shall be calculated based on trip generation rates from the most recent edition of the Trip Generation Manual published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, unless an alternative source of information is approved by the City Transportation Director or the NCDOT.

3.3.6 Period of Validity
A TIA shall be valid for a specific site for no more than eight years, so long as no significant modifications to the development proposed for the site that substantially increase the traffic impact are made. A TIA submitted in connection with a project that is accessed by a road that is operating at a level of service lower than the jurisdictions adopted level of service shall be valid for no more than five years, however.

3.3.7 Coordination with Zoning Map Changes, Site Plans, and Preliminary Plats
Transportation mitigation measures may be required to address issues raised by a TIA, or as part of the approval of a Transportation Special Use Permit (TSUP.) Such measures may include, but not be limited to, onsite and offsite improvements related to reduction of traffic impact on the surrounding road system, bicycle facilities, pedestrian movement, and the environment. These measures shall be conditions of development approval. Deletion or modification of these conditions shall require the same approval process that was required for the original project, unless the approved mitigation measure is deemed to conflict with NCDOT or City Transportation Department requirements, in which case they shall be modified to resolve the conflicts through submittal of a revised site plan or preliminary plat, as applicable.

3.3.8 Coordination with a Transportation Special Use Permit (TSUP)
Projects that require a TIA may also require a TSUP pursuant to Sec. 3.9, Special Use Permit.

3.5.1 Description
[IMAGE: <3.5.1_001.png>]
A. Purpose
The purpose of a zoning map is to amend the zoning district boundaries of the Official Zoning Map.
B. Initiation
A zoning map change may be initiated by the governing body, the Planning Commission, the Board of Adjustment, the Planning Director or designee, a citizen or the property owner or their agent, except that a petition for a zoning map change with a development plan may only be initiated by the property owner or their agent.
C. Development Plans
A development plan provides additional information with a zoning map change petition. The purposes of the development plan are set forth in paragraph 3.5.6, Development Plan. The development plan establishes the level of development that will be allowed on the property. Subsequent site plans or plats shall not deviate from the plan, unless otherwise allowed, or required under this Ordinance. Deviation may require a zoning map change, as established in paragraph 3.5.12, Deviations from Approved Development Plans. Unless a development plan also functions as a site plan, it is not a site specific development plan. The right to develop pursuant to a development plan, whether approved under this Ordinance or any previous ordinance, accrues only for any portion of the plan for which a site plan or preliminary plat is approved, and then only for the period of validity specified in this Ordinance, or where a vested right is established pursuant to Sec. 3.20, Statutory Vested Rights Determination.
D. Mandatory Development Plans
The development plan may be used by the petitioner in any zoning district; however, the development plan shall be required in the PDR, CC, MU, and IP districts and in the RS-M district if the applicant proposes to develop a building greater than 35 feet in height or proposes a density greater than eight units per acre. A development plan shall be required for additions to the UC District after the initial zoning map change establishing the District on each campus. Development plans may also be required as otherwise set forth in this Ordinance. The development plan shall become a part of the zoning map change petition and shall be reviewed concurrently with the zoning map change petition.
E. Traffic Impact Analysis
A traffic impact analysis may be required if the proposed zoning map change meets the threshold requirements established in Sec. 3.3, Traffic Impact Analysis

3.5.2 Pre-Application Conference
Pursuant to paragraph 3.2.2, Pre-Application Conference, a pre-application conference is required prior to the submittal of a zoning map change application.

3.5.3 Neighborhood Meeting
An applicant petitioning for a zoning map change that requires a TIA pursuant to Sec. 3.3, Traffic Impact Analysis, shall hold a neighborhood meeting as set forth in paragraph 3.2.3, Neighborhood Meeting.

3.5.4 Coordination with the Comprehensive Plan 
A. All petitions for zoning map change shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. A petition for zoning map change shall not be approved by the governing body when there is a conflict with the Comprehensive Plan, as determined by the Planning Director or designee (see Sec. 3.4, Comprehensive Plan Amendment).
B. When required, an application for a plan amendment shall be submitted and reviewed concurrently with an application for zoning map change. The public hearings on both the plan amendment and zoning map change may be heard at the same meeting. The decisions, however, shall be rendered with separate motions.

3.5.5 Application Requirements
A. An application for zoning map change shall be submitted in accordance with paragraph 3.2.4, Application Requirements.
B. Zoning map changes should correspond with the boundary lines of existing platted lots or tracts. If the boundaries of a zoning map change request stop short of an exterior property line, that portion of the property outside the proposed zoning map change boundary shall be capable of being subdivided and developed in accordance with the existing zoning and other requirements of this Ordinance.
C. All zoning requirements shall be met within the boundaries of the area being proposed for change, unless the area being changed is utilizing a development plan and is an addition to an existing area zoned with a development plan. If all of the requirements cannot be met on the site being changed, the zoning map change shall be expanded to include necessary property being used to meet zoning requirements. Projects utilizing a development plan may be expanded without meeting this criteria if, considering the original development plan area, the requirement can be met without violating any committed elements. Projects utilizing this provision shall provide graphics and/or a chart demonstrating how the requirements are met.
D. (County Only) If the boundaries of a zoning map change request in process are modified so as to 1) remove property from the request, and 2) have the effect of separating other adjoining properties from the boundaries of the modified request, that change shall be considered a substantial change from the original request and shall result in the modified request being considered a new zoning map change request and requiring resubmittal with a new application and applicable fees.

3.5.6 Development Plan
A. Purpose
A development plan is intended to identify commitments that are equal to or greater than Ordinance requirements, including but not limited to:
    1. Intensity/density of the proposed development;
    2. Sensitive areas and related protection;
    3. Any limitations on number, type, or range of uses;
    4. Dedications or reservations;
    5. Design elements if required or otherwise provided; and
    6. Development phasing if required or otherwise provided.
B. Designation/Effect
When a proposed zoning map change includes a development plan, the letter D shall follow the proposed zoning district designation. If approved, the letter D shall remain as a part of the zoning designation of the property. The elements submitted as part of the development plan, called "commitments", are binding and establish the level of development permitted on the property absent further zoning action except as otherwise allowed or required under this Ordinance. "Commitments" may also be identified as "committed elements" throughout this Ordinance.
C. Authority of Planning Director
The Planning Director is authorized to:
    1. Delegate authority under this section to a designee;
    2. Determine whether modification of an unapproved development plan or deviation from an approved development plan is significant/substantial or minor, or more or less stringent, if not specified in this section;
    3. Interpret commitments;
    4. Determine whether a conflict exists between commitments. Any conflict between commitments, including design commitments, shall be resolved in favor of the most stringent;
    5. Determine whether an element is a commitment if it is not specified as such in this section; and
    6. Determine whether additional staff review time is necessary following addition of commitments at hearings through proffers or illustrative graphic depictions. Such determination may require consultation with other departments.
D. Requirements
A development plan shall comply with all applicable laws and guidelines. Requirements under this section shall consist of the following, which may be supplemented by guidelines of the Planning Department.
    1. A development plan shall be signed and sealed by a Professional Engineer, Registered Architect, or Registered Landscape Architect. All graphic depictions shall be accurately scaled, and separate or additional sheets may be required by the Planning Department.

    2. The request shall be accompanied by mailing labels imprinted with the names and addresses of the previously notified property owners and a fee sufficient to cover the postage for renotification of surrounding property owners if the withdrawal occurs after the Planning Commission hearing.
    3. The applicant petitioning for a zoning map change with a development plan may withdraw the application at any time prior to the opening of the public hearing before the governing body by withdrawing consent to the development plan being imposed on the applicants property.
    4. The governing body may vote to allow the applicant to withdraw an application for a zoning map change at any time.
C. Administrative Withdrawal
The Planning Director or designee may withdraw applications due to the failure of the applicant to submit required information within 90 days of a request for such information.
D. Resubmittal of Withdrawn Applications
Except in the case of an application where the applicant withdrew consent to a development plan, no application that was previously withdrawn may be resubmitted until at least six months have elapsed since the date of withdrawal. In the case of applications withdrawn as a result of the withdrawal of consent to a development plan after publication of a notice of a public hearing, no new application may be resubmitted until at least 12 months have elapsed since the date of withdrawal. The Planning Director or designee may waive this waiting period if the application has been substantially modified or if there has been a significant change in facts or circumstances since the application was withdrawn.

3.5.8 Action by the Planning Director
A. The Planning Director or designee shall prepare a staff report that reviews the zoning map change request in light of any applicable plans and the general requirements of this Ordinance.
The staff report shall consider the entire range of permitted uses in the requested classification regardless of any representations made that the use will be limited, unless a development plan is submitted that restricts the permitted range of uses to specific uses.

    4. When a recommendation is not made within the time periods established in this section, the governing body may process the request without a Commission recommendation.
    5. A zoning map change proposed as a County case shall not require rehearing by the Planning Commission if the property subject to the proposed change is annexed into the City before the Board of Commissioners has acted on the case and the annexation is within 12 months of the original Planning Commission recommendation on the zoning map change, unless the applicant has made a significant modification to the application.
B. Changed Application
If the applicant makes a significant modification to an application for a zoning map change after the Commission has made its recommendation, the Planning Director shall refer the modified request back to the Commission for an additional public hearing. In such case, the Commission shall make a recommendation to the governing body within 90 days of the public hearing on the modified application. If a recommendation is not made within this time frame, the governing body may hear the application without a recommendation from the Planning Commission.

The Planning Commission shall not continue a request for which an expedited hearing has been set, nor shall any deferrals be granted for such a request.

3.5.10 Written Recommendation, Review Criteria
The Planning Commission shall provide a written recommendation regarding whether each proposed map change is consistent with the comprehensive plan and other applicable adopted plans. The recommendation shall be based on the reasons articulated by Commission members voting in the majority, and the recommendation shall be developed as determined in the Commissions Rules of Procedure. In addition to plan consistency, Commissioners may also consider other matters deemed appropriate by the Commission, which may include but are not limited to:
A. Compatibility with the present zoning and conforming uses of nearby property and with the character of the neighborhood;
B. Suitability of the subject property for uses permitted by the current versus the proposed district;
C. Whether the proposed change tends to improve the balance of uses, or meets a specific demand in the City and County; and
D. The availability of adequate school, road, parks, wastewater treatment, water supply and stormwater drainage facilities for the proposed use.

3.5.11 Action by the Governing Body

3.5.12 Deviations from Approved Development Plans
A. Significant Deviations
The deviations from an approved development plan listed below are deemed significant and shall require that the entire plan be resubmitted for a zoning map change in accordance with the application requirements of this section, except as specified in paragraphs B, C, and D below. Deviations not listed below do not require a zoning map change unless they are otherwise deemed significant or substantial:
    1. Increase by any amount in the number of residential units or approved density of residential projects in the overall project, except through use of the density bonus pursuant to Sec. 6.6, Affordable Housing Bonus;
    2. Decrease by more than 20% in total density in residential projects, except in the Downtown Tier or Compact Neighborhood Tier;
    3. Decrease by more than five percent in total density in residential projects located within the Downtown Tier or Compact Neighborhood Tier, unless that decrease results from the application of UDO requirements relating to size or design;
    4. In a nonresidential or mixed-use development, a cumulative expansion adjacent to a residential district or use that exceeds five percent of total building floor area or 4,000 square feet, whichever is greater, or a cumulative decrease that exceeds 20% of total building floor area if creating or maintaining intensity was important to the zoning map determination;
    5. With regard to development plans that were approved before commitments, or committed elements, were required to be identified on development plans, any change to a development plan depiction that exceeds current Ordinance requirements for setbacks, open space, buffer width or planting, recreation areas, tree protection areas, landscaped areas, or limitations on height, unless such depiction is clearly identified as "conceptual" or "illustrative";
    6. Elimination or reduction of a dedication of right-of-way, greenway, or other public component;
    7. A change in the proposed phasing of the project where phasing plans are required or are commitments;
    8. A change in use category (for example, residential to office, office to commercial, commercial to industrial, as described in Article 5, Use Regulations), if limitations on the number, range, or types of uses were proposed with the development plan and the governing body limited its consideration of uses to those uses;
    9. A change in the number, location, or configuration of access points to the development; or a change to previously shown public road improvements;
    10. A change in the location, square footage, or size of a building adjacent to a residential district or use;
    11. A change in the architectural design or architectural guidelines unless explicitly indicated as conceptual or illustrative;
    12. If a Traffic Impact Analysis was originally submitted, a change that would increase the total vehicle peak hour trips by three percent or greater. If a Traffic Impact Analysis was not originally submitted, a change that would require a Traffic Impact Analysis;
    13. An increase of more than three percent in impervious surface area; and
    14. Any change that is otherwise prohibited under this Ordinance.
B. Changes to Portions of Development Plans
    1. Where a deviation is proposed from a portion of a development plan, for example from one phase or zoning district, the Planning Director may consider cumulative deviations and the impact of such portion on the overall development in a significance assessment. If the deviation is deemed significant, the Planning Director shall determine whether it requires a zoning map change to all or only a portion of the development plan.
    2. A petition to change a development plan must include the previously approved development plan documents in its entirety with elements proposed for change clearly delineated (graphically and in text format). Previously approved documentation will be replaced in its entirety with the modified development plan.
C. Changes Following Transfers to Residential Owners
Where a deviation is proposed from a development plan and a portion of the development has been transferred to a residential owner, the Planning Director may exclude such residential portion from a significance assessment if it meets all minimum ordinance requirements. If the deviation is deemed significant, the Planning Director shall determine whether it requires a zoning map change to all or part of the development plan.
D. Changes Required by Ordinance or Other Law
Notwithstanding the other requirements of this section and except as stated below, a site plan or preliminary plat shall deviate from an approved development plan to conform to the requirements of a new ordinance or other law adopted after development plan approval, and a zoning map change shall not be required. Exceptions are: 1) where the development plan is vested by the appropriate governing body pursuant to the statutory vested rights procedure; and 2) as authorized under paragraph 1.10.3A, Approved Site Plans, Plats, and Permits and Completed Applications. Under such exceptions, the site plan or preliminary plat may conform to the approved development plan.

3.5.13 Protest Petition Sufficiency and Procedures
A. Protest Petition Defined
A petition in opposition to a zoning map change shall be considered a "valid protest petition" if the petition meets the requirements of applicable state law.
Commentary: Session Law SL2015-160 repealed the protest petition process for municipalities, effective upon zoning map change applications submitted after August 1, 2015. This law did not repeal Session Law SL2010-80, which allows protest petitions for zoning map change applications within Durham Countys jurisdiction.
B. Standards
    1. The petition must meet the substantive requirements of GS 160A-385(2) or Session Law 2010-80, as appropriate, and in particular must be signed by the owners of either:
        a. 20% or more of the area included in the proposed change or
        b. Five percent of the area of a 100-foot wide buffer extending along the entire boundary of each discrete or separate area proposed to be rezoned. In evaluating the sufficiency of a protest under this provision:
            (1) A discrete or separate area shall be calculated for any noncontiguous part of an area proposed for zoning map change that is physically separated from other areas proposed for change by property (not including right of way) that is not part of the requested zoning map change;
            (2) A street right of way shall not be considered in computing the 100 foot buffer area as long as the street right of way is 100 feet wide or less.
            (3) When less than an entire parcel of land is being rezoned, the 100 foot buffer shall be measured from the property line of the entire parcel.
[IMAGE: <3.5.13_001.jpg>]
    2. Property Ownership
    Property ownership shall be determined based on available recorded property records. In the event of records that are incomplete or in conflict, County tax listings may be used to determine ownership.
    3. Other Required Information
    The petition shall contain all information required on the form supplied by the Planning Director or designee or the City Clerk or the Clerk to the Board of Commissioners, as appropriate.
C. Procedure
    1. A form for a protest petition shall be available from the Planning Director, or designee, or the City Clerk or the Clerk to the Board of Commissioners, as appropriate.
    2. Completed petitions shall be submitted to the appropriate Clerks office (City Clerk or Clerk to the Board of Commissioners) at least four working days prior to the day of the public hearing.
    3. The Planning Director, or designee, in consultation with the Attorney for the jurisdiction shall determine if the petition meets the criteria for classification of "valid protest petition". The Clerk shall inform the governing body that a petition has been filed and indicate the determination by the Planning Director, or designee, whether the petition is valid or invalid. The Planning Director, or designee, shall notify the petitioner as to the validity of the protest petition.
    4. Where a substantial modification to a zoning map change application that requires resubmission to the Planning Commission has been submitted, the Planning Director, or designee, shall notify the petitioner, in writing, that a new protest petition is required.
    5. Petitions for zoning map change for which a protest petition has been determined to be valid shall require a ¾ vote of the governing body for approval rather than a simple majority. Vacant positions and members who have been excused from voting because of a conflict of interest shall not be considered in computing governing body membership.
D. Withdrawal
Persons or entities who have signed protest petitions may withdraw their signatures at any time prior to the vote on the proposed map change. Any withdrawal must meet standards established for such withdrawals by the Planning Department. Withdrawals submitted less than two working days prior to the public hearing may result in a continuance of the hearing if the effect of the withdrawal on the validity of the protest cannot be determined prior to the public hearing.
E. Exemption
The foregoing provisions concerning protest petitions shall not be applicable to any zoning map change that establishes the Citys zoning designation on property that has been added to the Citys jurisdiction as a result of annexation, except as provided by general or local law.

3.5.14 Coordination with Site Plans
Approval of a zoning map change with a development plan shall enable the owner or an authorized agent of the owner to prepare a site plan in conformance with the zoning map change and development plan for the property. The site plan may be prepared for the entire property or phases of the development project in accordance with Sec. 3.7, Site Plan Review.

3.5.15 Subsequent Applications
When the governing body has taken action on a zoning map change, no new application may be filed for a similar zoning map change until at least 12 months have elapsed since the date of the previous action. The Planning Director, or designee, may waive this requirement if the application has been significantly modified or there has been a significant change in the facts or circumstances since the previous request.

3.8.1 Applicability
[IMAGE: <3.8.1_001.png>]
A. If required under Sec. 12.10, Sedimentation and Erosion Control, an approved sedimentation and erosion control plan and/or a land-disturbing permit shall be obtained before commencing land-disturbing activity.
B. Pursuant to Sec. 113A-57(4) of the North Carolina Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973, no person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity that will disturb more than one acre or requires a sedimentation and erosion control plan under Sec. 12.10 unless, 30 or more days prior to initiating the activity, an erosion and sedimentation control plan for the activity is filed with and approved by the County Sedimentation and Erosion Control Office.

3.8.2 Application Requirements
A. Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan
    1. Two copies of a sedimentation and erosion control plan and one preliminary set of construction drawings shall be filed with the County Sedimentation and Erosion Control Office. A digital copy of approved construction drawings must be submitted upon their approval.
    2. A sedimentation and erosion control plan shall contain site drawings, vicinity maps, assumptions, calculations, narrative statements, and a construction sequence as needed to adequately describe the proposed development and the measures proposed to comply with the requirements of this Article.
    3. A sedimentation and erosion control plan shall be prepared by, and bear the seal and signature of, a registered professional engineer, registered landscape architect, registered architect, registered land surveyor, or certified professional in erosion and sediment control. The County Sedimentation and Erosion Control Officer or designee may, however, deem such a seal and signature not necessary due to site simplicity (as the absence of sensitive geographical features and receiving watercourses) and the limited nature of the sedimentation and erosion control measures required.
    4. The approval of sedimentation and erosion control plan is conditioned on the applicants compliance with Federal, State and local water quality laws, regulations, and rules.
    5. An approved sedimentation and erosion control plan shall be kept on file at the job site.
B. Land-Disturbing Permit
    1. A land-disturbing permit may be obtained by submitting the following:
        a. Applicable fee;
        b. Verification of an approved site plan or written approval issued by the Durham City-County Planning Department;
        c. Completed Durham County Financial Responsibility/Ownership Form With Landowner Consent Form (FRO);
        d. Approved sedimentation and erosion control plan, if required;
        e. Improvement security, if required;
        f. Certification that tree protection fencing has been installed, if required; and
        g. Approval of the proposed project by the City or County as applicable.
    2. No permit shall be issued until such time as the Sedimentation and Erosion Control Officer or designee is assured that the proposed land-disturbing activity will be carried out in accordance with this section and Sec. 12.10, Sedimentation and Erosion Control, and the approved sedimentation and erosion control plan, if required. A land-disturbing permit application may be disapproved for the same reasons that a sedimentation and erosion control plan may be disapproved, as set forth in paragraph 3.8.7, Disapproval of Plan, of this Ordinance.
    3. The Sedimentation and Erosion Control Officer or designee shall require security to assure performance of the conditions of the permit whenever a land-disturbing activity is in excess of five acres or whenever the Officer or designee determines that the activity may result in significant off-site damage. The applicant shall file with the Officer or designee an improvement security in the form of a performance bond or letter of credit. The amount shall be that which the Officer or designee deems sufficient to cover all costs of protection or other improvements required for conformity with standards specified in this section and Sec. 12.10, Sedimentation and Erosion Control. The security may be adjusted or released as the amount of disturbed area changes. The security shall be released when the Officer or designee has certified that all of the requirements of such sections have been met. Forfeiture of the improvement security shall not release the person conducting the land disturbing activity of their obligation to install and maintain necessary erosion control measures, to stabilize the site, or any other obligation of this section or Sec. 12.10, Sedimentation and Erosion Control, or any rule or order promulgated in furtherance thereof.
    4. Prior to initiating land-disturbing activity, the permitee shall notify the Sedimentation and Erosion Control Office of the date that such activity will begin.

3.8.4 Action by Sedimentation and Erosion Control Office
A. The County Sedimentation and Erosion Control Officer or designee shall review each complete sedimentation and erosion control plan submitted and within 30 days of receipt shall notify the person submitting the plan that it has been approved, approved with modifications, or disapproved. Failure to approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove a complete plan within 30 days of receipt shall be deemed approval. Failure to approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove a revised plan within 15 days of receipt shall be deemed approval. Disapproval of a plan must specifically state in writing the reasons for disapproval.
B. If, following commencement of a land-disturbing activity pursuant to an approved sedimentation and erosion control plan, the County Sedimentation and Erosion Control Officer or designee determines that the plan is inadequate to meet the requirements of this section or Sec. 12.10, Sedimentation and Erosion Control, the Officer or designee may require such revisions as it deems necessary to comply with such sections. Failure to approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove a revised plan within 15 days of receipt shall be deemed approval. Pending approval of a revised plan, work shall cease or shall continue only as authorized by the Officer or designee.
C. The County Sedimentation and Erosion Control Officer or designee shall review each permit application that does not require an approved sedimentation and erosion control plan and within 14 calendar days of receipt shall notify the person submitting the application that it has been issued or denied.

3.8.5 Preconstruction Conference
When deemed necessary by the Sedimentation and Erosion Control Officer, or designee, a preconstruction conference may be required.

The landowner, the financially responsible party, or the landowners or the financially responsible partys agent shall perform an inspection of the area covered by the plan after each phase of the plan has been completed and after establishment of temporary ground cover in accordance with Sec. 12.10. The person who performs the inspection shall maintain and make available a record of the inspection at the site of the land-disturbing activity. The record shall set out any significant deviation from the approved erosion control plan, identify any measures that may be required to correct the deviation, and document the completion of those measures. The record shall be maintained until permanent ground cover has been established as required by the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan. The inspections required by this subsection shall be in addition to inspections conducted by the Durham County Sedimentation and Erosion Control Office.

3.8.7 Disapproval of Plan
A. An erosion control plan may be disapproved upon a finding that an applicant, or a parent, subsidiary or other affiliate of the applicant:
    1. Is conducting or has conducted land-disturbing activity without an approved plan;
    2. Has received notice of violation of a plan previously approved by the North Carolina Sedimentation Control Commission or a local government pursuant to the North Carolina Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973, as amended, and all rules and orders adopted pursuant to it (the Act) or local ordinance adopted pursuant to the Act, and has not or had not complied with the notice within the time specified in the notice;

C. Criteria for Approval
Applications for a transportation special use permit shall be approved only if the governing body makes the following findings:
    1. The traffic generated by the development and associated improvements to the street system will not have a significant adverse impact on the surrounding area. Significant adverse impact shall include:
        a. Substantial increases in traffic on local residential streets such that the majority of the traffic is not associated with the residential properties which front on the street; or
        b. The need to widen local residential streets, which would detract significantly from the character or basic function of the nearby streets.
    2. Adequate provisions have been made for safe and efficient vehicular circulation, parking and loading, and pedestrian access.
    3. The traffic generated by the proposed development and any proposed improvements to the street system will not have a significant adverse impact on the environment. Significant adverse impacts shall include but not be limited to undue concentration of air pollutants, or excessive noise or vibrations.
    4. The traffic generated by the development can be accommodated by the existing or funded transportation system, or adequate traffic mitigation measures have been proposed as part of the development application. Proposed mitigation measures shall become conditions of the special use permit. The adopted level of service for the adjacent roadways may be considered in making this determination but shall not be the sole factor considered by the governing body.

3.9.10 Coordination with Variances
Applications for variances may be submitted concurrently with requests for special use permits. However, decisions shall be rendered separately for any variance and the special use permit(s).

3.9.11 Coordination with Zoning Map Change Applications

3.9.13 Amendments
Alterations or revisions to approved special uses may be approved by the Planning Director or designee if the special use still meets the intent of the standards established with the original approval. Significant modifications to approved special uses, as determined by the Planning Director or designee, shall require submittal of a new application.

3.9.14 Expiration
A special use permit shall become null and void in any of the following cases:
A. If a site plan or architectural review, as applicable, is not approved within 12 months of the date of permit approval.
B. If an approved site plan, architectural review application, or building permit expires.
C. If a building permit is not issued within two years of the date of approval, in cases where a corresponding site plan or architectural review is not required.

3.14.1 Applicability
[IMAGE: <3.14.1_001.png>]
A. The Board of Adjustment may vary certain requirements of this Ordinance, in harmony with the general purpose of these regulations, where unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of the Ordinance.
B. Despite the above and pursuant to 15A NCAC 02B .0233 and 15A NCAC 02B .0267, a major variance from the requirements of Sec. 8.5, Riparian Buffer Protection Standards, including where incorporated by reference, shall be granted only by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission. A minor variance may be granted by the approval authority in accordance with paragraph 8.5.12, Variances.
C. No variance shall be granted that would have the effect of allowing a use not permitted in the use table in Sec. 5.1, Use Table, or by Sec. 8.4, Floodplain and Flood Damage Protection Standards.
Commentary: Variances may be granted for, among other things, height, structure size, lot dimensions, and setbacks.

3.14.2 Pre-Application Conference
All applicants seeking a variance shall schedule a pre-application conference with the Planning Director or designee to discuss the procedures, standards, and regulations required for variance approval in accordance to the provisions of this Ordinance.

3.14.3 Application Requirements

3.14.7 Action by the Board of Adjustment
A. Each decision shall be accompanied by a finding of fact by the Board of Adjustment which specifies the reasons for the decision.

3.14.8 Findings
In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment shall make the following findings:
A. Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the Ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
B. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.
C. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify granting a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.
D. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the Ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.

3.14.9 Watershed Protection

A recommendation from the Board of Adjustment for a variance shall constitute a request by the local government for a variance from the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission. Such variances shall be considered major variances in accordance with Title 15A NCAC .0104(r).
B. For all variance requests from Sec. 8.7, Watershed Protection Overlay Standards, except those from Sec. 8.5, Riparian Buffer Protection Standards, as referenced therein, the local government with jurisdiction shall notify and allow reasonable comment period for all local governments having jurisdiction within the watershed area of the water supply source and the entity using the water supply for consumption.
C. The Planning Director, or designee, shall keep a record of variances to Sec. 8.7, Watershed Protection Overlay Standards. This record of variances, not including those from Sec. 8.5, Riparian Buffer Protection Standards, as referenced in Sec. 8.7, shall be submitted to the Division of Water Resources, North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality by January 1st of each year. The record shall provide a description of each project receiving a variance and the reasons for granting a variance. The record of variances from Sec. 8.5 shall be included in the annual report to the North Carolina Division of Water Resources summarizing activities implementing the requirements of that section.

A. Application Process
    1. General
    Petitions to initiate the establishment of a local historic district are granted or denied by the applicable governing body, depending upon jurisdiction. Petitions shall first be considered by the Historic preservation Commission (HPC), which shall make a recommendation to the governing body as to whether the governing body should or should not initiate the request. If the governing body initiates the request, staff will proceed as directed with the designation of a local historic district zoning overlay (-H), including development of the required Historic District Preservation Plan.
    Commentary: As noted below, the HPC must consider findings before sending the request to the governing body. The governing body will consider information provided by the applicant, the HPC, and staff. Information provided by the applicant will include a percent of property owner support for the designation, which may factor in the governing bodys decision to initiate the establishment of the proposed historic district designation.
    2. Submittal
        a. Requests to establish a local historic district shall be submitted to the Planning Department, which shall in turn send the request to the HPC for its recommendation to the governing body.
        b. The Planning Department shall give notice in accordance with paragraph 3.2.5, Notice and Public Hearings, that a request has been filed and shall be considered by the HPC at a specified date and time.
    3. HPC Recommendation

        a. That the area is of special significance in terms of its prehistorical, historical, architectural or cultural importance; and
        b. That the area possesses integrity of design, setting, materials, feeling and association.
    4. Governing Body Action
    Upon reviewing information provided by the applicant and staff, and the findings and recommendation from the HPC, the governing body shall determine whether to initiate a formal designation process of the proposed local historic district, including development of the Historic District Preservation Plan.

B. Historic District Preservation Plan
    1. An Historic District Preservation Plan shall include an investigation and report describing the significance of the buildings, structures, features, sites, or surroundings included in the proposed historic district and a description of the boundaries of the proposed historic district, in accordance with NCGS §160A-400.4(1); principles and design review criteria (guidelines) for certificates of appropriateness as required in NCGS §160-400.9(c); and a preservation strategy tailored to the individual needs of the specific area.

In accordance with NCGS §160A-400.4(2), the NC Department of Natural and Cultural Resources shall make an analysis of and recommendations concerning the investigation and report contained in the Historic District Preservation Plan. Failure of the NC Department of Natural and Cultural Resources to submit its written analysis and recommendations within 30 days after a written request for such analysis has been received by the Department shall relieve the governing body of any responsibility for awaiting such analysis, and the governing body may at any time thereafter take action on the proposed historic district and Historic District Preservation Plan.

Consideration of the Historic District Preservation Plan shall be part of the consideration of the historic district designation.
E. Action by the Planning Commission
    1. The Planning Commission shall conduct a public hearing and give notice in accordance with paragraph 3.2.5, Notice and Public Hearings, on the proposed historic district designation and the Historic District Preservation Plan.

    3. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a property owner from making any use of his or her property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.
    4. No certificate of appropriateness shall be required for interior changes. However, this does not excuse the property owner from obtaining required building permits for interior work.

3.17.2 Coordination with Other Permits

C. Approval Criteria for Historic Districts
    1. For historic districts, the intent of these regulations is to ensure, insofar as possible, that buildings or structures in the historic district shall be in harmony with other building or structures located therein. However, it is not the intention of these regulations to require the reconstruction or restoration of individual or original buildings or to prohibit the demolition or removal of such buildings or to impose architectural styles from particular historic periods. In considering new construction, the HPC shall encourage contemporary design which is harmonious with the character of the historic district.
    2. In granting a COA, the HPC shall take into account, in accordance with the Historic Properties Local Review Criteria, as amended:
        a. The historic or architectural significance of the structure under consideration in relation to the historic value of the district;

    3. The HPC may place conditions upon a COA as part of the approval in order to facilitate compliance with the Historic Properties Local Review Criteria, as amended. A violation of any condition shall be considered a violation of the COA.
E. Deferral of Application
    1. An applicant for a COA may request that the HPCs consideration of the application be deferred to a specific date.
    2. Upon such request, the Planning Director, or designee, shall have the authority to grant the deferral.
    3. A request for deferral shall be made in writing to the Planning Director, or designee, at least ten days prior to the scheduled consideration of the application and shall indicate the date to which the deferral is requested and the reasons for the deferral. Only one deferral shall be permitted for each application.
F. Time Limits

However, the effective date of such a certificate of appropriateness may be delayed for a period of up to 365 days from the date of approval. This maximum period of delay shall be reduced by the HPC when it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from such structure or landmark by virtue of the delay. During such period, the HPC may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the structure or landmark.
B. If the HPC finds that the structure has no particular significance or value toward maintaining the character of an historic district, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal.
C. If the HPC finds that the structure has no particular significance or value toward maintaining the character of an historic district, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal. An application for demolition, destruction and relocation of a building, site or structure determined by the State Historic Preservation Officer as having statewide significance as defined in the criteria of the National Register of Historic Places may be denied except where the HPC finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use or return from such structure or landmark by virtue of the denial.

B. The provisions of this section that apply to COAs shall also apply to master COAs.
C. In addition to acquiring a master COA, the City and County and any public utility companies shall notify the City Manager or County Manager, as appropriate, prior to performing any work within any historic district. In emergency situations, as determined by the Inspections Director, or designee, notification by the next work day is acceptable. Such work shall be done in accordance with the Historic Properties Local Review Criteria, as amended, adopted for the historic district as part of the Historic District Preservation Plan. The City Manager or County Manager, as appropriate, may inspect all work done pursuant to a master COA.

3.17.8 Submission of New Application
If the HPC denies an application for a COA, a new application affecting the same property may be submitted only if substantial changes are made in plans for the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving or demolition, or if conditions related to the historic district or historic landmark or surrounding uses have changed substantially.

3.17.9 Local and State Coordination
The HPC shall use all reasonable efforts to expedite any concurrent process with the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources if such a process is desired by the applicant for the purpose of securing both a certificate of appropriateness and a Federal historic preservation tax credit.

3.17.10 Specific Enforcement
A. Compliance with the terms of a COA shall be enforced by the Inspections Director, or designee. Construction or other work which fails to comply with a COA shall be a violation of this Ordinance and subject to Article 15, Enforcement. The discontinuance of work for a period of six months shall be considered a failure to comply with a COA.
B. Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit, impair or limit in any way the power of the City or County to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration or removal of buildings, structures, appurtenant fixtures or outdoor signs in the historic district in violation of the provisions of this Ordinance.

C. Failure to obtain a required COA prior to commencing work shall be subject to Article 15, Enforcement.

    12. Deterioration that contributes to a hazardous or unsafe condition.

3.18.2 Process and Administration
A. Director Investigation and Determination
    1. Initiation by Petition
    The initial determination that there is a condition of neglect shall be made by the Planning Director, or designee, after an investigation that is initiated by a petition from any person who is familiar with the subject property, which may include but not be limited to a City employee.
    2. Notice of Investigation
    On receipt of a petition, the Director, or designee, shall notify the owners in writing of the allegation and the process for making a decision regarding the petition, including any applicable deadlines. Among other things, the notice shall offer the owner the opportunity to meet in person with the Director, or designee, and to present any relevant information. Notice shall be delivered by personal service, or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If certified mail is refused or unclaimed, notice may be delivered by first class mail, and shall be considered effective if such mail is not returned by the post office within 15 days of mailing. In the case of notice by first class mail, notice shall also be posted on the property. Notice of the investigation may also be given to the owners of nearby or adjacent properties or neighborhood associations.
    3. Responsibilities of Director
    The Planning Director or designee shall:
        a. Investigate the allegation that a condition of neglect exists;
        b. Hold one or more meetings at a time to be set by the Director, or designee, in which the owner, other persons who have received notice, or other interested persons may give information;
        c. Issue a written determination, supported by findings of fact, regarding the allegation within 45 days of the owners receipt of notice;
        d. Include within the determination a time period for correcting the condition of neglect, if a condition of neglect has been found;
        e. Retain all information presented by the owner or other persons;
        f. Deliver the written determination through any of the means for delivery of notice, as described above;
        g. Designate the written determination as a final administrative determination with the right of appeal to the HPC; and
        h. Include information regarding rights to a de novo hearing before the HPC.
B. Suspension of Process
The above process may be suspended in the event the owner agrees in writing to correct the alleged condition of neglect within a time period determined to be reasonable by the Director, or designee. If the condition is not corrected within that time period, the process shall continue where it was suspended.
C. Appeal of Directors Determination
If the property owner disagrees with the Directors determination, the owner can appeal and may request a de novo hearing before the HPC. The request shall be delivered to the Planning Department, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the Directors determination. The HPC shall hold a quasi-judicial hearing on the issue of whether demolition by neglect is occurring on the property. Procedures that would be followed by the Board of Adjustment (BOA) in a quasi-judicial proceeding shall be used. The Directors determination shall be considered an administrative determination, which has been appealed to the HPC, as the designated Planning Agency under GS 160A-388 or 153A-321 and all procedures applicable to the Board of Adjustment in GS 160A-388 and GS 153A-345 shall apply to such hearings. The HPCs determination to overturn the administrative determination shall be passed by the standards established in paragraph 2.4.6. The HPCs written decision shall include findings of fact and conclusions regarding demolition by neglect consistent with this subsection.

D. Safeguards from Undue Economic Hardship
    1. Right of Claim of Economic Hardship
    The property owner is entitled to make a claim of undue economic hardship if the owner is unable to make needed repairs to the property because it is economically unfeasible.
    2. Issuance of Stay for Economic Hardship
    In the event that the owner and/or other parties in interest do not wish to contest the determination regarding the condition of neglect, but do wish to petition for a claim of undue economic hardship, the Directors order shall be stayed until after the HPCs determination regarding the claim.
    3. Process
    If a claim of undue economic hardship is made, the Planning Director or designee shall receive all information from the property owners that the HPC is entitled to receive pursuant to this Ordinance, make a determination regarding whether there is undue economic hardship, and develop a plan for dealing with such hardship, if it is found to exist. The recommendation and plan shall be sent to the owner, by certified mail, return receipt requested, with notice of the owners rights to appeal to the HPC within 30 days of receipt. If the owner disagrees with the recommendation and plan, the owner may request a hearing before the HPC. In the event of such a request, the hearing shall be a quasi-judicial hearing, in the nature of a BOA hearing and the decision shall be in writing, supported by findings and conclusions. The Planning Directors determination as to economic hardship and the plan for dealing with that hardship shall be considered a final administrative determination, and any HPC decision altering such recommendation or plan shall be passed by the standards established in paragraph 2.4.6, Decisions.
    4. Evidence Regarding Undue Economic Hardship
    When a claim of undue economic hardship is made owing to the effects of this Article, the owner and/or parties in interest shall, where reasonably possible, provide the evidence below, describing the circumstances of hardship, and any additional evidence requested by the Director, or designee, or HPC or evidence the owner considers relevant.
        a. Nature of ownership (individual, business, or nonprofit) or legal possession, custody, and control.
        b. Financial resources of the owner and/or parties in interest.
        c. Cost of repairs.
        d. Assessed value of the land and improvements.
        e. Real estate taxes for the previous two years.
        f. Amount paid for the property, date of purchase, and party from whom purchased, including a description of the relationship between the owner and the person from whom the property was purchased, or other means of acquisition of title, such as by gift or inheritance.
        g. Annual debt service, if any, for previous two years.
        h. Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked, and offers received, if any.
        i. Annual gross income, if any, from the property for the previous two years.
        j. Itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two years, including proof that adequate and competent management procedures were followed.
        k. Annual cash flow, if any, for the previous two years.
    5. Plan to Relieve Economic Hardship
    A recommended plan to relieve the economic hardship shall include, but is not limited to, property tax relief as may be allowed under North Carolina law, loans or grants from the City, the County, or other public, private, or nonprofit sources, acquisition by purchase or eminent domain, changes in applicable zoning regulations, or relaxation of the provisions of this Article sufficient to mitigate the undue economic hardship. The Director, or designee, shall issue an order regarding the time period during which the property should be repaired, taking into account the provisions of the recommended plan.
E. Other City Powers; Citys Election of Remedies
Nothing contained within this Article shall diminish the Citys power to declare a building unsafe or in violation of the minimum housing code or any other applicable statute or code. In addition, the procedures described herein are mandatory only for determinations being made solely under the authority of this section. Where other sections of the City Code apply, the City may, in its discretion, choose to process any action regarding the property under such other provisions alone, or under such provisions along with these provisions concurrently, or solely under these provisions. The City may also suspend the procedures of this section at any time if an action has been initiated under other applicable law.
F. Penalties and Remedies
Enforcement of this Article shall be by any one or more of the following methods, and the institution of any action under any of these methods shall not relieve any party from any other civil or criminal proceeding prescribed for violations and prohibitions.
    1. Equitable Remedy
    The City may apply for any appropriate equitable remedy to enforce the provisions of this Article.
    2. Order of Abatement
    The City can apply for and the court may enter an order of abatement. An order of abatement may direct that improvements or repairs be made, or that any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with this Article. Whenever the party is cited for contempt by the court and the City has executed the order of abatement, the City shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing the order of abatement.
    3. Civil Penalty
    Civil penalties can be assessed for failure to comply with a final administrative determination or an un-appealed HPC decision under the provisions and guidelines for assessing such penalties for zoning code violations. Prior to imposing a civil penalty the City-County Planning Department shall deliver a written notice by personal service or by registered mail or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the person responsible for the violation indicating the nature of the violation and ordering corrective action. Where the violation is the failure to remedy a condition of neglect within the time periods provided by the Director, or designee, or the HPC no additional time period for compliance need be given. The notice shall include information regarding the possible assessment of civil penalties and other possible enforcement actions. If this notice is appealed to the Board of Adjustment, the Board shall not rehear any issue that was heard by the HPC or could have been so heard had an appeal to the HPC been made. Rather, the Board of Adjustment shall limit the scope of its review to whether there has been compliance with the Directors determination or the HPCs determination, as applicable.

[IMAGE: <3.20.1_001.png>]
A. This section establishes a procedure for obtaining a statutory vested right in conformance with NCGS §153A-344.1 and NCGS §160A-385.1.
B. New or amended zoning regulations shall not apply to a property with an established vested right until the vested right expires or is terminated.
C. A vested right may be established upon approval of a "site specific development plan." In order to qualify as a "site specific development plan," a plan shall be a development plan approved as a site plan or preliminary plat in accordance with Sec. 3.5, Zoning Map Changes; a preliminary plat approved in accordance with Sec. 3.6, Subdivision Review; or a site plan approved in accordance with Sec. 3.7, Site Plan Review.

3.20.2 Application Requirements
A. An application for vested rights determination shall be submitted in accordance with paragraph 3.2.4, Application Requirements.
B. Applications shall include, at a minimum, the following information in addition to the standard information required pursuant to paragraph 3.2.4, Application Requirements:
    1. Information on the proposed uses of the property that the applicant wishes to vest;
    2. The length of time for which vesting is requested;
    3. A listing of those provisions of this Ordinance from which vesting is requested;
C. Landowners seeking zoning vested rights on plats, special use permit applications, or other plans that would not normally receive site plan approval, can apply for vested rights protection through submittal of an application which contains the identical information, fee, and plans required for a complete site plan application and an additional fee for a vested rights public hearing.

3.20.3 Action by the Planning Director
Once the application has been determined complete, the Planning Director, or designee, shall schedule a public hearing, give public notice as set forth in paragraph 3.2.5, Notice and Public Hearings, and forward a copy of the application with all related materials to the appropriate governing body.

3.20.4 Action by the Governing Body
A. The governing body may hold the vested rights public hearing at the same time that the site plan is considered for approval.
B. Approval by the governing body shall confer upon the owner of the property a zoning "vested right" as defined in NCGS §160A-385.1 and NCGS §153A-344.1, effective on the date of approval. The governing body may condition the approval upon terms and conditions reasonably necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

3.20.5 Effect of Zoning Vested Rights
A. Following approval or conditional approval of a site specific development plan, nothing in this section shall exempt such a plan from subsequent reviews and approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original approval.
B. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the revocation of the original approval or other remedies for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions of the approval or with this Ordinance.
C. The establishment of a zoning vested right shall not preclude the application of new laws or regulations as is allowed under NCGS §160A-385.1. In addition, it shall not preclude overlay zoning that imposes additional requirements, but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land use regulation by the City or County. Otherwise applicable new or amended regulations shall become effective with respect to property that is subject to a site specific development plan upon the expiration or termination of the vested right in accordance with this section.
D. A zoning vested right is not a personal right, but shall be attached to and run with the applicable property. After approval of a site specific development plan, all successors to the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such right while applicable.

3.20.6 Duration
A. A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this section shall remain vested for the period specified by the governing body, which shall be a minimum of two years but no more than five years from the date of the vested rights determination. The expiration and validity of site plans and plats issued pursuant to the vested rights determination that extend beyond the vesting period shall be governed by the provisions of this ordinance. Substantial amendments and modifications to an approved site specific development plan shall not be accorded "vested rights" unless such changes are processed as a new "site specific development plan." Each approved site specific development plan shall contain the following notation: "Approval of this plan establishes a zoning vested right under NCGS §160A-385.1 or NCGS §153A-344.1. Unless terminated at an earlier date, the zoning vested rights shall be valid until (Insert date)."
B. A building permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the passage of time while a zoning vested right under this section is outstanding.
C. A right which has been vested as provided in this section shall terminate at the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to portions of the development that do not have approved and continuously valid site plans and preliminary plats, or buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed.

3.20.7 Termination
A zoning vested right as provided in this section shall terminate when any one of the following circumstances apply:
A. At the end of the applicable vesting period;
B. With the written consent of the affected landowner;
C. Upon findings by the governing body by ordinance and after public hearing, that natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the site specific development plan;
D. Upon payment of compensation to the affected owner for all costs, expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner together with interest;
E. Upon findings by the governing body by ordinance and after public hearing, that the landowner or the landowners representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations which made a difference in the approval by the governing body of the site specific development plan; or
F. Upon the enactment of a State or Federal law or regulation or local ordinances enacted in compliance with such laws or regulations that preclude development as contemplated in the site specific development plan.

3.20.8 Annexation
A. Property that is annexed shall retain any vested rights throughout the original vesting period subject to the limitations of paragraph B below.
B. A property owner petitioning for annexation shall submit a signed statement declaring any existing vested right with respect to the properties subject to annexation, if the owner wishes to maintain the vested right. The failure to sign such a statement shall terminate any such vested right.

Nothing in this section shall be deemed to create any vested rights other than those established under NCGS §160A-385.1 or NCGS §153A-344.1. In the event that either NCGS §160A-385.1 or NCGS §153A-344.1 is repealed, the provisions of this section are no longer effective to the jurisdiction involved.

3.23.1 Purpose
This section provides a procedure for making requests for reasonable accommodation to land use and zoning regulations, policies, practices, and procedures of the City and County of Durham to comply fully with the intent and purpose of Federal laws.

3.23.2 Applicability
A. This section shall apply to those persons who are defined as disabled or handicapped under Federal law. A person recovering from substance abuse is considered a person with a disability or handicap; however, a person who is currently engaging in the illegal use of controlled substances is not.
B. A request for a reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a disability or handicap, his or her legal representative, or a provider of housing for persons with disabilities or handicaps in the citys and countys land use and zoning regulations, when the application of such may act as a barrier to affording such person(s) equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling in accordance with the law.
C. A request for a reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards, and/or practices for the siting, development, and use of housing or housing-related facilities in this ordinance, that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability or handicap an equal opportunity to a dwelling of his or her choice.
D. Nothing in this section requires persons with disabilities or handicaps, or operators of family care homes, or group homes for persons with disabilities, or handicaps acting or operating in accordance with applicable zoning, licensing or land use laws or practices, to seek reasonable accommodation under this section.

3.23.3 Other Regulatory Obligations
A reasonable accommodation shall not affect an individuals obligations to comply with other applicable regulations not at issue in the requested accommodation.

3.23.4 Pre-Application Conference
If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable accommodation, the Planning Department will provide assistance to ensure that the process is accessible. Applicants seeking reasonable accommodation may request a pre-application conference with the Planning Director or designee to discuss the procedures, standards, and regulations applicable for submittal of an application. Such requests shall be made at least 10 days prior to the date of submittal.

3.23.5 Application Requirements
A. An application for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted in accordance with paragraph 3.2.4, Application Requirements. In addition, the following information shall be provided by the applicant:
    1. The current actual use of the property;
    2. The basis for the claim that the applicant is considered disabled or handicapped under Federal law;
    3. The UDO provision(s) or regulation(s) from which reasonable accommodation is being requested; and
    4. An explanation of why the reasonable accommodation is necessary to make the specific property available for the individual.
B. An application for a reasonable accommodation under this section shall be submitted to the Planning Director or designee.

3.23.6 Notice and Public Hearings
Once the application has been determined complete, the Planning Director or designee shall schedule a public hearing and give notice as set forth in paragraph 3.2.5, Notice and Public Hearings.

3.23.7 Burden of Proof
The applicant seeking reasonable accommodation shall have the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to allow the Board of Adjustment to make the findings set forth below, as well as the burden of persuasion on those issues.

3.23.8 Action by the Planning Director
The Planning Director or designee shall provide the Board of Adjustment with a copy of the application and all relevant materials pertaining to the request prior to the public hearing.

3.23.9 Action by the Board of Adjustment
A. Each decision shall be accompanied by a written finding of facts by the Board of Adjustment which specifies the reasons for the decision; and
B. The Board of Adjustment may prescribe whether the reasonable accommodation is granted to the applicant or shall be allowed to pass with transfer of property.
C. The Board of Adjustment may approve the request, deny the request, or continue the request. In approving the request, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe reasonable and appropriate conditions provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the request.

3.23.10 Findings
A. In granting a reasonable accommodation request, the Board of Adjustment shall find based on competent, material, and substantial evidence, that the proposed accommodation:
    1. Will be used by an individual or individuals with a disability or handicap protected under Federal law;
    2. Is "reasonable." An accommodation is reasonable if it will not undermine the legitimate purposes and effects of existing zoning regulations, and if it will not impose significant financial and administrative burdens upon the city or county and/or constitute a substantial or fundamental alteration of the ordinance provisions; and
    3. Is "necessary." An accommodation is necessary if it will provide direct or meaningful therapeutic amelioration of the effects of the particular disability or handicap, and it will afford handicapped or disabled persons equal opportunity to enjoy and use housing in residential districts in the city or county.
B. The Board of Adjustment shall issue a written order on a request for reasonable accommodation within 60 days of the date of the quasi-judicial decision.

3.23.11 Appeal
Appeal from final action by the Board of Adjustment on a reasonable accommodation request can be taken by filing a petition in the nature of certiorari with the Durham County Superior Court.

1Within Rural Villages as designated in the Comprehensive Plan only
2Within Suburban Transit Areas as designated in the Comprehensive Plan only, using Support Area standards as defined in Sec. 6.5, Residential Compact (RC) Development Intensity.
Commentary: Downtown Design District Core, Support 1, and Support 2 are the only districts allowed in the Downtown Tier. Therefore the Downtown Tier boundary and the Downtown Design District boundary are the same.
B. All development plans approved as part of a rezoning action shall continue in force, except as may be modified in the future under the provisions of paragraph 3.5.12, Deviations from Approved Development Plans.

4.1.2 Development Tier Map
A. The Development Tier Map is intended to ensure that development reflects the character of the area within which it occurs and to minimize the cost of extending infrastructure into areas inappropriately. The tiers shown on the map shall function as overlays, establishing guidelines within which different development patterns, intensities, and densities shall be utilized. The development tiers shall include the following:
    1. The Rural Tier  That area of Durham that lies outside the Suburban Tier and largely within watershed critical areas within which development should maintain a rural focus to encourage preservation of agriculture and protect important water resources. Development within this area should feature large lots to minimize demands on infrastructure, with limited commercial areas.
    2. The Suburban Tier  That area not included within the Downtown, Compact, Urban, or Rural Tiers in which urban services are expected to be provided with development at traditional suburban densities and patterns. This area is anticipated to absorb the majority of Durhams population growth and its attendant demands for housing, employment, and goods and services, including opportunities for affordable housing and recreation.
    3. The Urban Tier  That area surrounding the historic downtown of the City within which development was concentrated prior to the 1960s. Within this area, development should maintain an urban form with small lot sizes and differing uses in proximity to one another.
    4. The Compact Neighborhood Tier  That area near planned transit stations, within which development is intended to be transit-, bicycle- and pedestrian-oriented to enhance the street level experience and provide a mixture of goods and services. Auto-oriented and low intensity uses shall be discouraged.
    5. The Downtown Tier  That area covered by the Downtown Master Plan within which development is intended to be transit- and pedestrian-oriented in order to enhance the street level experience and provide a mixture of goods and services near transit. Auto-oriented and low intensity uses are discouraged.
B. The location and boundaries of the development tiers described throughout this Ordinance shall be as shown on the geographic coverage layer entitled "Tiers" that is maintained as part of the City's and County's geographic information systems (GIS) under the direction of the Planning Director, or designee. This depiction of tier boundaries shall constitute the Development Tier Map for the City's and County's jurisdiction and is adopted into this Ordinance by reference. The City or County Clerk, as appropriate, may, upon validation by the Planning Director, or designee, certify a paper copy of the Development Tier Map, or portions of the map, as a true and accurate copy of the Development Tier Map, or a portion thereof.
C. The Planning Director or designee shall revise the Development Tier Map when amendments are passed by the governing body in accordance with Sec. 3.4, Comprehensive Plan Adoption/Amendment. Such revisions shall be made as soon as possible after the effective date of the amendment but in no event later than five days after the effective date.
D. No unauthorized person may alter or modify the Development Tier Map. The Planning Director, or designee, shall correct errors in the map as they are discovered.
E. The Planning Director, or designee, shall revise the Development Tier Map, if necessary, following an interpretation of a Boundary Watershed Critical Area pursuant to paragraph 4.11.3, Rules for Interpretation of Overlay Boundaries, or an interpretation of zoning district boundaries pursuant to 4.1.4, Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries.
F. The Planning Director, or designee, may authorize printed copies of the Development Tier Map to be produced and shall maintain digital or printed copies of superseded copies of the map for historical reference.

4.1.3 Official Zoning Map
A. The location and boundaries of zoning districts shall be as shown on a geographic coverage layer entitled Zoning that is maintained as part of the City's and County's geographic information system (GIS) under the direction of the Planning Director, or designee. This depiction of zoning boundaries as shown on the GIS system shall constitute the Official Zoning Map for the City's and the County's zoning jurisdiction, and is adopted into this Ordinance by reference. The City or County Clerk, as applicable, may upon validation by the Planning Director, or designee, certify a paper copy of the Official Zoning Map, or portions of the map, as a true and accurate copy of the Official Zoning Map, or a portion thereof, under the authority of GS 160A-79(b) and GS 153A-50.
B. The Planning Director, or designee, shall revise the Official Zoning Map when amendments are passed by the governing body in accordance with Sec. 3.5, Zoning Map Change. The Planning Director, or designee, shall correct errors in the map as they are discovered.
C. No unauthorized person may alter or modify the Official Zoning Map. Errors in the Official Zoning Map shall be corrected as they are discovered, and the corrected information shown on the GIS system.
D. The Planning Director, or designee, may authorize printed copies of the Official Zoning Map to be produced, and shall maintain digital or printed copies of superseded versions of the Official Zoning Map for historical reference.

4.1.4 Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries
A. The Planning Director, or designee, may authorize periodic changes to the boundaries of the Official Zoning Map in conformance with this section.
    1. Interpretations of zone boundaries, except for watershed overlay boundaries, may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.
    2. Interpretations regarding watershed overlay boundaries shall be performed pursuant to paragraph 4.11.3, Rules for Interpretation of Overlay Boundaries.
B. Boundaries That Follow Lot Lines
    1. A boundary shown on the Official Zoning Map as following a lot line or parcel boundary shall be construed as following the lot line or parcel boundary as it actually existed at the time the zoning boundary was established, as shown on maps submitted or used when the boundary was established.
    2. If, subsequent to the establishment of the zoning boundary, a property line adjustment is made based upon a court ruling, the zoning boundary shall be construed to move with the lot line or parcel boundary if the adjustment is less than 10 feet.
C. Boundaries That Do Not Follow Lot Lines
    1. Where the ordinance establishing a zoning boundary identifies the boundary as following a particular natural feature such as a ridgeline, contour line, a river, stream, lake or other water course, or reflects a clear intent that the boundary follow the feature, the boundary shall be construed as following that feature as it actually exists. If, subsequent to the establishment of the boundary, such natural feature should move as a result of natural processes (slippage, subsidence, erosion, flooding, sedimentation, etc.), the boundary shall be construed as moving with the natural feature.
    2. A boundary shown on the Official Zoning Map as approximately following a street or railroad line shall be construed as following the centerline of the street or railroad right-of-way. If, subsequent to the establishment of the boundary, the centerline of the street or railroad right-of-way should be moved as a result of its widening or a minor realignment (such as at an intersection), the boundary shall be construed with moving with the centerline only if the centerline is moved no more than 25 feet.
    3. A boundary shown on the Official Zoning Map as approximately parallel to, or as an apparent extension of, a feature described above shall be construed as being actually parallel to, or an extension of, the feature.
    4. If a zoning boundary splits an existing lot or parcel, the metes and bounds description, if one was submitted at the time the zoning boundary was established, shall be used to establish the boundary.
    5. If the specific location of the boundary cannot be determined from application of the above rules to the Official Zoning Map, it shall be determined by scaling the mapped boundary's distance from other features shown on the map.

In addition to a mixture of compatible uses, development in this district shall provide amenities, walkways and open space to increase pedestrian activity, decrease reliance on individual vehicles, foster transit usage, enhance the attractiveness of Durham City and County, improve the overall quality of life, and provide for the welfare of the citizens.
The MU District is used to implement the Comprehensive Plan within those areas shown as the Suburban, Urban or Compact Neighborhood Tiers.

Sec. 4.5 Design District Intent Statements

Paragraphs:
4.5.1        Downtown Design (DD)
4.5.2        Compact Design (CD)
4.5.3        Compact Suburban Design (CSD)
4.5.4        Sub-Districts
Development guidelines for all Design districts may be found in Article 16, Design Districts.

4.5.1 Downtown Design (DD)
The Downtown Design (DD) District is established to encourage bicycling, pedestrian, and transit-oriented development through regulations appropriate to the downtown area. It focuses on the form of the private and public realm instead of on use and intensity. Regulated through sub-districts, the standards encourage a vital downtown economy that enhances Durhams position as a commercial, cultural and entertainment hub of the region while increasing livability. The DD District is intended to work in tandem with the Downtown Tier of the Durham Comprehensive Plan, Downtown Durham Master Plan and updates. Therefore the Downtown Tier boundary and the Downtown District boundary are the same.

4.5.2 Compact Design (CD)
The Compact Design (CD) District is intended to encourage development of appropriate urban streetscape and form through bicycling, pedestrian, and transit-oriented development through various sub-districts similar to the Downtown Design District. Compact Design Districts are located within areas designated as Design District within Compact Neighborhood Tiers of the Durham Comprehensive Plan.

4.5.3 Compact Suburban Design (CSD)
The Compact Suburban Design (CSD) District is intended to encourage development of appropriate urban streetscape and form through bicycling, pedestrian, and transit-oriented development through various sub-districts similar to the Downtown Design District. Compact Suburban Design Districts are located within areas designated as Design District within Compact Neighborhood Tiers of the Durham Comprehensive Plan with existing suburban character.

4.5.4 Sub-Districts
Sub-districts of Design Districts are individual zoning districts that reflect and promote different levels of development intensity reflective of the policies established within the Comprehensive Plan. Primary sub-districts are Core, Support-1, and Support-2. Additional special sub-districts are established to reflect unique development requirements for areas designated for Design District regulations.

    1. Pedestrian Business Sub-District (Ninth Street)
    The Pedestrian Business sub-district (Ninth Street) (CD-P(N)), which is located in the Compact Design District that incorporates a portion of Ninth Street, is created to protect the character existing along the east side of Ninth Street within the district and to ensure that any new development on the west side of Ninth Street within the district is in keeping with that character.

Sec. 4.6 Neighborhood Protection Overlay (-P)

Paragraphs:
4.6.1        Purpose
4.6.2        Establishment of Overlay
4.6.3        Modification of Standards
4.6.4        Design Guidelines
4.6.5        Tuscaloosa  Lakewood Neighborhood Protection Overlay
4.6.6        Old West Durham Neighborhood Protection Overlay
Commentary: This overlay district would be used to help protect the character of specific neighborhoods. An example might be providing flexibility for infill projects in an older area that has retained its original pattern of development, to ensure maintenance of the existing character of the neighborhood.

4.6.1 Purpose
The purpose of the Neighborhood Protection Overlay is to protect and preserve the established character of existing neighborhoods by limiting the flexibility of underlying base districts in order to more effectively match the density, intensity or established character of an existing area. The overlay may also be used to establish specific design guidelines that are more detailed than the standards of this Ordinance for use during review of development within the overlay.

4.6.2 Establishment of Overlay
A. A Neighborhood Protection Overlay may only be established as both a zoning map change in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 3.5, Zoning Map Change, to reflect the boundaries of the designated overlay, and a text amendment in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 3.19, Text Amendment, to codify the standards established within the overlay.
B. Multiple Neighborhood Protection Overlays shall not be designated over any individual property. A property may only be located within one Neighborhood Protection Overlay.
C. The overlay and any associated standards or guidelines shall reflect the prevalent intensity and consistent building design in the neighborhood, to ensure that new development reflects the identifiable physical character of the area. The standards or guidelines proposed for the overlay shall be included with the original petition for designation as defined in paragraph 4.6.3, Modification of Standards.
D. The Planning Director, or designee, shall review any proposed overlay and any associated standards or guidelines to determine their conformity with the requirements of this section. As part of this review, the Planning Department shall hold at least one neighborhood meeting to ensure continued neighborhood support for the request prior to initiating the public hearing process.
E. No review fee shall be required in the establishment of a Neighborhood Protection Overlay.

4.6.3 Modification of Standards
A. A Neighborhood Protection Overlay may allow for the modification of any of the following standards within this Ordinance:
    1. Restrictions to the use regulations in Article 5, Use Regulations (the proposed standards may impose stricter limitations governing uses than allowed by the underlying zoning but shall not permit uses not allowed by the underlying districts);
    2. District intensity standards in Article 6, District Intensity Standards;
    3. Site design standards in Article 7, Design Standards;
    4. Tree protection and tree coverage standards in Article 8, Environmental Protection;
    5. Landscaping and buffering standards in Article 9, Landscaping and Buffering;
    6. Parking standards in Article 10, Parking and Loading; or
    7. Sign standards in Article 11, Sign Standards.
B. A Neighborhood Protection Overlay may allow for restrictions on building design or placement details, including scale, mass, materials, and architectural style.
Commentary: North Carolina Session Law SL2015-86 limits the ability to place design or aesthetic regulations upon single-family and two-family residential structures.
C. Any modified standards and regulations applicable within a Neighborhood Protection Overlay shall be expressly set forth in the overlay district at the time of adoption.

4.6.4 Design Guidelines
Where appropriate and allowed by State statute, a Neighborhood Protection Overlay may require the application of specific design guidelines in the review of development. Such guidelines shall be established as part of the overlay district at the time of adoption, and implemented through review and approval of site plans pursuant to Sec. 3.7, Site Plan Review, or architectural review pursuant to Sec. 3.22, Architectural Review.

4.8.4        Additional Requirements

4.8.1 Purpose
The Airport Overlay is established to contribute to the safe operation of airports, to facilitate orderly development around airports, and to control and minimize impacts on surrounding activities. It is also the intent of this overlay to encourage land use patterns which are appropriate for the airport vicinity and public safety by avoiding concentrations of population. Standards are provided to ensure an attractive entrance to the area in order to encourage trade and commerce and thereby maintain economic vitality.

4.8.2 Applicability
The Airport Overlay applies to properties in the vicinity of Raleigh-Durham Airport. The specific boundaries are defined on the Official Zoning Map and are imposed on property as an addition to the underlying zoning district. The boundaries generally follow physical boundaries which are identifiable on the landscape and are related to the airport noise contours as determined by the Raleigh-Durham Airport Authority. The Airport Overlay is divided into two suboverlays which are further described below:
A. -A65
Shall be that area found within the 65 Ldn of the Raleigh-Durham Airport and shown on the Official Zoning Map.
B. -A60
Shall be that area located outside the 65 Ldn but within the 60 Ldn of the Raleigh-Durham Airport and shown on the Official Zoning Map.

4.8.3 Permitted Uses and Prohibitions
A. Permitted Uses in -A65
Only the following uses shall be allowed, pursuant to the permissibility of the underlying zoning district in Sec. 5.1, Use Table: Agricultural, Residential, and Utilities (per Public and Civic Uses).
B. Permitted Uses in -A60
All uses in the underlying zoning district shall be permissible pursuant to Sec. 5.1, Use Table, with the exception of outdoor firing ranges.
C. Prohibited Lighting
The lighting types below shall not be permitted:
    1. Any moving, pulsating, flashing, rotating, or oscillating light, which may interfere with air traffic other than navigational markings or lights marking potential obstructions in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration requirements.
    2. Flood lights, spot lights, or other lighting devices which are not shielded so as to prevent illumination in an upward direction.
    3. Any light which constitutes a misleading light within the meaning of Federal Aviation Administration regulations.
D. Prohibited Electronic Signals
Any electronic impulse or signal which interferes with communications between aircraft and the airport, or which interferes with established navigation aids shall be prohibited.
E. Prohibited Heights
Structures and signs of a height which obstruct the takeoff and landing of aircraft, as determined by the Federal Aviation Administration, shall be prohibited.

4.8.4 Additional Requirements
A. The Raleigh-Durham Airport Authority shall have the opportunity to review applications for a special use permit, variance, zoning map change, subdivision, or site plan approval within the airport overlay prior to a decision by the approving authority. All development shall also comply with the airspace regulations adopted by the Raleigh-Durham Airport Authority. Whenever said airspace regulations impose more stringent requirements or limitations than are required by this Ordinance, the provisions of the airspace regulations shall prevail.
B. Residential development within the Airport Overlay shall demonstrate that aircraft noise exposure within the dwellings shall not exceed decibel levels of 45 Ldn and be certified by an acoustical engineer or a board certified member of the Institute of Noise Control Engineering. Measures for reducing noise exposure may include: orientation of structures, design standards, landscaping, or construction materials used in walls, windows, doors, roofs, floors, or ceilings. Design guidelines for noise reduction are available from publications of the Raleigh-Durham Airport Authority.
C. Residential development within the Airport Overlay shall ensure that purchasers of the dwellings will be notified that the property may be subject to noise exposure from aircraft using Raleigh-Durham Airport. Measures used to notify purchasers may include notices on plats or deeds.

4.9.4        Freestanding Signs

4.9.1 Purpose
The MTC Overlay is established to enhance the economic and aesthetic appeal and orderly development of properties adjacent to major transportation corridors. Certain arterial streets, parkways and expressways are of critical importance to Durham City and County. Rights-of-way carrying high volumes of traffic are image makers for Durham City and County. They act as entryways for visitors and residents and also serve as an indicator of the quality of life found in the area. Standards are provided to ensure that highways, freeways, and other similar high-volume rights-of-way in this overlay develop with improved traffic efficiency and safety by reducing visual clutter and avoiding inappropriate site design.

4.9.2 Applicability
Except in design districts, the MTC Overlay shall apply to all property within 1,250 feet of a designated right-of-way, and may extend up to 2,500 feet at intersections. The actual boundaries shall be determined at the time of adoption of the MTC Overlay and shall be shown on the Official Zoning Map. The MTC Overlay shall be measured perpendicular to the edge of:
A. The right-of-way of the limited access highway; or
B. The right-of-way for a frontage road, if present.

4.9.3 Buffer Requirements
A. Location of Buffers
A buffer shall be provided along the perimeter of the property line adjacent to the designated right-of-way.
B. Buffer Width
    1. The buffer width shall be no less than 30 feet and no more than 100 feet. The actual buffer width shall be determined at time of adoption of the overlay. In determining the width of the buffer, the governing body shall consider the following factors:
        a. The topography of the area;
        b. The existing and proposed land uses;
        c. The size of the adjacent parcels;
        d. The traffic volumes of the corridor; and
        e. Any additional factors the governing body deems reasonable in carrying out the purpose of the Ordinance.
    2. The following buffer widths shall be provided for the following designated rights-of-way:

Sec. 4.11 Watershed Protection Overlay

Paragraphs:
4.11.1       Purpose
4.11.2       Establishment of the Districts
4.11.3       Rules for Interpretation of Overlay Boundaries
4.11.4       Nonresidential Land Use Restrictions

4.11.1 Purpose
A. The purpose of the Watershed Protection Overlay is to preserve the quality of the region's drinking water supplies through application of the development standards in Article 8, Environmental Protection. In general, water supply protection will be accomplished by establishing and maintaining low intensity land use and development on land near the region's water supply rivers and reservoirs. Where high density development is desired, water supply protection will be accomplished through the use of engineered stormwater controls. The overall objective is to:
    1. Reduce the risk of pollution from stormwater running off of paved and other impervious surfaces; and
    2. Reduce the risk of discharges of hazardous and toxic materials into the natural drainage system tributary to drinking water supplies.
B. Watershed protection regulations shall be adopted by the City of Durham and Durham County in accordance with the requirements of the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission, Title 15A NCAC 2B .0100, .0200 and .0300, (adopted pursuant to NCGS §143-214.5) and in accordance with NCGS §160A-381 through 383, and NCGS §153A-340 through 342.

4.11.2 Establishment of the Districts
A. The following six Watershed Overlays shall be established for lands within the watersheds of public drinking water rivers and reservoirs. Each Watershed Overlay is divided into two areas, a Critical Area (A) and a Protected Area (B), based on their distance from the protected water supply and ridge lines that define the drainage basin.
+---------+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------+

D. Where a general boundary crosses a parcel, parcels one-half acre or less shall be excluded from the Overlay, and parcels greater than one-half acre shall be included. Upon adoption of this Ordinance, the parcels included in each Overlay and their Watershed Overlay designation shall be shown on the Official Zoning Map.

4.11.3 Rules for Interpretation of Overlay Boundaries
A. When a property is divided by one or more of the arcs representing the one half-mile, the one-mile, or the five-mile distance from the reservoir, or by the ridgeline that defines the water supply reservoir, a request can be submitted for an interpretation of the Watershed Overlay boundary through the City-County Planning Department. The request can be submitted by any individual and shall include sufficient information to enable the Planning Director to make a recommendation to the governing body and NC Environmental Management Commission (EMC), as appropriate.
B. For all requests, the Planning Director will evaluate the request and will seek approval from the appropriate governing body for submission to the NC Environmental Management Commission (EMC). Upon such approval, the Planning Director will submit the proposed Watershed Overlay boundary change to the EMC, in accordance with 15A NCAC 02B .0104(o). Upon approval by the EMC, the Planning Director will complete the interpretation and modify the Watershed Overlay boundary in accordance with the interpretation. All such changes shall be shown on the Official Zoning Map and the Watershed Overlays Parcels Map, which shall be maintained by the Planning Department.
Commentary: The NC Administrative Code, in Rule 15A NCAC 02B .0104(o), states that all revisions (expansions and deletions) to the Environmental Management Commission (EMC) adopted critical and protected area boundaries or to the local governments interpreted critical and protected area boundaries must be approved by the EMC prior to adoption by the local government.
C. The Planning Director, or designee, shall interpolate the general boundary as shown on the Watershed Overlays Parcels Map, but may vary it to exclude lots of one-half acre or less in a proposed subdivision. In addition, the Planning Director, or designee, may use identifiable physical features, such as roads, streams or easements, as boundaries if they approximately coincide with the interpolated general Overlay boundary. All such changes shall be shown on the Development Tier Map, the Official Zoning Map, and the Watershed Overlays Parcels Map, which shall be maintained by the Planning Department.

5.1.1 Use Table Key
A. Types of Uses
    1. Permitted (P)
    A P in the use table indicates that a use is allowed by right in the respective district. Such uses are subject to all other applicable requirements of this Ordinance, including restrictions and prohibitions within an approved development plan of record for the property under consideration. They are not subject to the limited use standards found in Sec. 5.3, Limited Use Standards.
    2. Permitted Subject to Limitations (L)
    An L indicates that a use shall be permitted by right; provided, that the use meets the additional requirements imposed by the referenced section in the Notes column of the table. These could include appropriate limited use standards set forth in Sec. 5.3, Limited Use Standards, and, for residential uses, the intensity standards imposed in Article 6, District Intensity Standards; the design standards imposed in Article 7, Design Standards; and/or Article 16, Design Districts. Such uses are subject to all other applicable requirements of this Ordinance, including restrictions and prohibitions within an approved development plan of record for the property under consideration.
    3. Special Use Permit Required (M or m)
    An M (Major) or m (minor) indicates that a use is only allowed where approved as a special exception by the appropriate approving authority in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 3.9, Special Use Permit.
        a. Special uses are subject to all other applicable requirements in this Ordinance, including the additional listed use standards in Sec. 5.3, Limited Use Standards, except where expressly modified by the approving authority as part of the special use approval.

Sec. 5.2 Use Categories

Paragraphs:
5.2.1        General
5.2.2        Agricultural Use Categories
5.2.3        Residential Use Categories
5.2.4        Public and Civic Use Categories
5.2.5        Commercial Use Categories
5.2.6        Industrial Use Categories
Commentary: The following use categories are not zoning districts. These categories are intended only to provide a mechanism to group uses for regulatory purposes. The names of some use categories (for example, Commercial) may be similar to zoning districts (such as Commercial, General). A use listed in the examples below is only permitted by zoning district in accordance with the use table in Sec. 5.1.

5.2.1 General
A. Approach to Categorizing Uses
    1. The use categories found in the use table in Sec. 5.1, Use Table, are set forth in this section. Specific uses may be further defined in Article 17, Definitions.
    2. Use Determination
        a. If a use is not specifically set forth in the use category in this section the Planning Director, or designee, shall determine if the use is similar to a specific use in accordance with this section. Where such similar specific use is subject to limited use standards or special use permit approval, the proposed use shall also be subject to such standards or approval.
        b. If the Planning Director, or designee, cannot determine a similar specific use, then the Planning Director shall determine the most appropriate use group of the six use groups identified in this section and paragraph 5.1.2, Use Table, (agricultural, residential, public and civic, commercial, office, or industrial) to apply the unspecified use.
            (1) The same criteria in paragraph 5.2.1C, Use Not Specifically Listed, shall be used except for criteria #14.
            (2) The unspecified use is allowed with approval of a minor special use permit pursuant to Sec. 3.9, Special Use Permit, in any zoning district where a specific use within that use group is permitted with a P.
B. Basis for Classifications
Use categories classify land uses and activities based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, likely impact on surrounding properties, and site conditions. The use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning land uses to appropriate zoning districts.
C. Uses Not Specifically Listed
Determination of the appropriate use group and similar specific use shall be made by the Planning Director, or designee, in accordance with the criteria below. The following use information may be supplemented using NAICS codes as promulgated from time-to-time by the U.S. Census Bureau. The criteria below shall be used to determine both the appropriate group and category for a use not specifically listed in the use table or the examples in the use category descriptions, and whether a use is considered principal or accessory.
    1. The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use category;
    2. The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity;
    3. Relative amounts of sales from each activity;
    4. The customer type for each activity;
    5. The relative number of employees in each activity;
    6. Hours of operation;
    7. Building and site arrangement;
    8. Types of vehicles used and their parking requirements;
    9. The relative number of vehicle trips generated;
    10. Signs;
    11. How the use is advertised;
    12. The anticipated impact on surrounding properties;
    13. Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site; and
    14. When considering appropriate districts for a use not listed in the use table, the district intent statements in Article 4, Zoning Districts, shall be taken into consideration.
D. Developments with Multiple Principal Uses
Developments with multiple principal uses shall conform to the following:
    1. When all principal uses of a development fall within one Use Category, the entire development shall be assigned to that Use Category;
    2. When the principal uses of a development fall within different Use Categories, each principal use shall be classified in the applicable Use Category and each use shall be subject to all applicable regulations for that Use Category.
E. Principal Uses
    1. The Principal Uses portion of each use category lists principal uses common to that use category. The names of these sample uses are generic and are based on common meanings, not on what a specific use may call itself.
    Commentary: A use that calls itself Wholesale Warehouse, but sells mostly to retail consumers, is included in the Retail Sales and Service category rather than the Wholesale Trade category.
    2. Facilities proposed in support of a principal use, including, but not limited to, parking, access, and stormwater facilities, shall be considered part of the principal use and, unless otherwise authorized within this Ordinance, comply with the same zoning permissibility for the principal use per Sec. 5.1, Use Table. Connections to public utilities shall be excluded from this requirement.
    Commentary: Parking for a school, for example, must be located within a zoning district that would allow for the school. If the zoning district had limited use standards and/or required a special use permit, the proposed parking must also comply with those requirements.
F. Accessory Uses
Accessory uses are allowed by right in conjunction with a principal use unless otherwise stated elsewhere in these regulations. Some listed accessory uses can also be considered accessory structures. No accessory use shall be established on a site without a principal use.
G. Uses Not Included
The Uses Not Included portion provides cross-references to uses that may appear to be part of a particular category, but that are explicitly handled in a different use category.

6.1.1 Purpose
The district development standards of this Ordinance establish lot sizes and certain restrictions for all residential and nonresidential development. These standards allow for variety in housing and building types while striving to maintain the overall character of neighborhoods and commercial areas of Durham. Development standards established in this Ordinance are based on Durhams planning tiers as established in the Comprehensive Plan. Standards in this section are specific to each district and are above and beyond the general standards for all districts enumerated in Article 7, Design Standards, through Article 13, Additional Requirements for Subdivisions. Separate standards are established to regulate residential and nonresidential development in each tier and for certain nonresidential districts. This approach to district and tier development standards implements the Comprehensive Plan and has several public benefits:
A. It allows for development that is more sensitive to the environment and allows for the preservation of open and natural areas.
B. It promotes quality site layout and energy-efficient development.
C. It promotes affordable and life-cycle housing.
D. It promotes development intensities that match existing and proposed infrastructure investments.
E. It promotes infill development that is consistent in character and scale with established neighborhoods.
F. It promotes compact land development that supports alternate transportation, such as bicycling, walking, mass transit.
G. It promotes market-based development decisions while protecting shared public interests.

6.1.2 Flexible Development Tools by Plan Tier
The district intensity standards set forth in this Article provide for flexible development tools in each planning tier, as shown below. For the Downtown Tier and certain Compact Neighborhood Tiers, refer to Article 16, Design Districts.

1Please see Sec. 12.5, Recreation Land, for additional land dedication requirements that may apply.
2For conservation subdivision dimensional requirements, see below.
    2. Within a conservation subdivision:
        a. The minimum street yard shall be eight feet.
        b. No minimum side yard shall apply; however, a minimum building separation of 10 feet shall apply.
        c. Rear yards shall be those indicated for conventional subdivisions in the table in paragraph 6.2.1A.1 above.
        d. Minimum lot areas for conservation subdivisions shall be approved by the County Health Department for individual wastewater treatment systems. Where public or community wastewater systems are approved to serve the development, no minimum lot size or width shall apply.
    3. Additional height is permitted for non-farm structures at a rate of one additional foot for every one foot of additional setback provided. In no event shall the structure be more than 45 feet in height.
B. Development in the Rural Villages of Bahama and Rougemont as designated in the Comprehensive Plan can use the Suburban Tier dimensional standards subject to Sec. 8.4, Floodplain and Flood Damage Protection Standards, and Sec. 8.7, Watershed Protection Overlay Standards, and the availability of water and wastewater treatment systems.
C. Accessory Structure Requirements (Not Applicable to Bona Fide Farms in the County)
    1. In addition to the accessory structure requirements set forth in Sec. 5.4, Accessory Uses and Standards, the following accessory structures shall maintain a minimum 50-foot setback from all property lines:
        a. New farm buildings and equestrian facilities; and
        b. Pens, chicken coops, corrals, or similar enclosures where livestock are kept.
    2.  Livestock shall be kept in pens, chicken coops, corrals, or similar enclosures.
    Commentary: The Durham City Code of Ordinances considers the accumulation of refuse and debris a public nuisance pursuant to Sec. 26-179, Accumulation of refuse and debris declared public nuisance; abatement.

6.2.2 Permitted Housing Types
Only single-family detached houses, as described in paragraph 7.1.2, and manufactured homes shall be permitted. For conservation subdivisions in the Suburban Tier, single-family, duplex, and townhouse housing types are allowed.

6.2.3 Residential Density
Residential density shall not exceed the maximum densities set forth in paragraph 6.2.1A, Dimensional Standards.

6.2.4 Conservation Subdivision
A. Purpose
The conservation subdivision shall be established for the following purposes:
    1. To provide flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land;
    2. To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat;
    3. To preserve important historic and archaeological sites;
    4. To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development;
    5. To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development;
    6. To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community;
    7. To promote contiguous green space with adjacent jurisdictions;
    8. To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood;
    9. To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries;
    10. To promote construction of landscaped walking trails and bike paths conveniently located both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles;
    11. To conserve scenic views from public roadways and reduce perceived density; and
    12. To protect prime agricultural land and preserve farming as an economic activity.
B. Applicability of Regulations
    1. This conservation subdivision option is available as a use by right subject to subdivision approval in accordance with Sec. 3.6, Subdivision Review; and in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph 6.2.4A, Purpose, and paragraph 6.2.4H, Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas.
    2. As required under Sec. 3.6, Subdivision Review, a conservation subdivision shall conform to the requirements of this Ordinance, including Article 8, Environmental Protection, and other development-related ordinances; except that the requirements of this section shall supersede any conflicting ordinance provisions.
    3. Spray irrigation for the treatment of wastewater within a conservation subdivision shall require a major special use permit under Sec. 3.9, Special Use Permit, unless the area to be irrigated is a primary conservation area that is farmland or agricultural land.
C. Ownership of Development Site
The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.
D. Density Calculation
Maximum density in a conservation subdivision shall be determined by multiplying the gross area of the tract of land, including all areas typically excluded from density calculations in Article 8, Environmental Protection, by the maximum gross density for the site as defined in subsection 6.2.1A, Dimensional Standards.
E. Mass Grading
Mass grading is allowed in conservation subdivisions that receive public water/sewer service or use community wastewater treatment facilities or package treatment plants. It is prohibited in all other conservation subdivisions.
F. Open Space Requirements
    1. Relationship to other open space requirements
    Except for paragraph 7.2.5, Ownership and Management of Open Space, the requirements of Sec. 7.2, Open Space, do not apply to conservation subdivisions.
    2. Amount of open space
    The amount of open space shall be 50% of total gross area as required under Sec. 6.2, Residential Rural (RR) Development Intensity, and shall be apportioned as set forth below in paragraph G, Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas and Other Open Space.
    3. Ownership
    Open space shall be held in common ownership or dedicated to the public or a land trust or similar conservation-oriented non-profit organization rather than platted as part of individual private lots, and shall be subject to the requirements of paragraph 7.2.5, Ownership and Management of Open Space.
    4. Notwithstanding the above requirements, area within required riparian buffers can be used to satisfy any open space requirement.
G. Application Requirements
    1. Submittal Requirements
    In addition to all subdivision application materials required in accordance with Sec. 3.6, Subdivision Review, the applicant shall submit a site analysis map. The complete site analysis map shall first be presented for discussion at the pre-application conference required under paragraph 3.2.2, Pre-Application Conference.
    2. Site Analysis Map
    The purpose of the site analysis map is to ensure that the important site features have been adequately identified prior to the creation of the site design, and that the proposed open space will meet the requirements of this section. The site analysis map shall include the following features:
        a. Property boundaries;
        b. All streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands and other hydrologic features;
        c. Topographic contours of no less than 10-foot intervals unless a more precise vertical scale is available;
        d. All primary and secondary conservation areas labeled by type (see paragraph H. below);
        e. General vegetation characteristics;
        f. General soil types and areas suitable for installation of on-site wastewater treatment systems;
        g. The planned location of protected open space;
        h. Existing roads and structures; and
        i. Potential connections with existing open space and trails.
H. Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas and Other Open Space
    1. Primary Conservation Areas
    At least 80% of the required open space in a conservation subdivision shall consist of primary conservation areas.
    Commentary: Because 50% of the total gross area in a conservation subdivision must be open space under paragraph 6.2.1, Development Standards, 40% of the total gross area must be primary conservation areas.
    The following are considered primary conservation areas and shall be included within the required open space in the order of preference listed below. Secondary conservation areas and other open space can be included only after primary conservation areas comprise 80% of required open space.
        a. Special Flood Hazard Areas and Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas;
        b. Riparian buffers along all perennial and intermittent streams;
        c. Wetlands protected by the Army Corps of Engineers or the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality and any provided or required buffers;
        d. Lakes, ponds, and other water bodies, excluding created stormwater management facilities;
        e. Areas at least 5,000 contiguous square feet in size with any natural slopes greater than 25%;
        f. Existing forests (meeting the standards in paragraph 8.3.1D, Preserved Tree Coverage, except any that conflict with the provisions of this section), at least one contiguous acre in size, in which healthy hardwood trees at least 10 inches in diameter at breast height comprise at least 50% of the area;
        g. Wildlife corridors, wildlife habitats, and other sites identified in the Durham County Inventory of Important Natural Areas, Plants and Wildlife (Inventory) or adopted plans;
        h. Greenways, rail trails, and other open space identified in adopted plans;
        i. Historic sites or structures currently designated in, or eligible for, the National Register of Historic Places;
        j. Sites identified in the Durham Architectural and Historic Inventory;
        k. Sites identified in the Durham County Archaeological Inventory and other identified archeological sites, including cemeteries and burial grounds;
        l. Sites at least five contiguous acres in size identified by the City, County, State, or federal government as farmland or agricultural land that is prime, unique, or of statewide or local importance; and
        m. Viewsheds from designated federal and North Carolina Scenic Byways.
    2. Secondary Conservation Areas
    The following are considered secondary conservation areas and shall be included within the required open space in the order of preference listed below if additional space is still required after all primary conservation areas have been included:
        a. Existing forests (meeting the standards in paragraph 8.3.1D, Preserved Tree Coverage, except any that conflict with the provisions of this section), at least 12,000 contiguous square feet in size, in which healthy hardwood trees at least 10 inches in diameter at breast height comprise at least 50% of the area;
        b. Areas with any natural slope greater than 20%, unless identified as primary conservation areas;
        c. Buffers in excess of Ordinance requirements around any primary conservation area;
        d. Individual existing healthy trees greater than 18 inches in diameter at breast height; and
        e. New or existing improved pedestrian trails that are not identified as primary conservation areas or located in other conservation areas and that do not negatively impact other conservation areas. Such trails can be located in utility easements only if all utilities in the easements are buried, and in such cases only the improved trails, and not the easements, shall be considered secondary conservation areas.
    3. Other Open Space
    The following areas can be included within the required open space if additional space is still required after all primary and secondary conservation areas have been included:
        a. Any land used for agricultural purposes that is not a primary conservation area;
        b. Naturally vegetated areas, or areas re-vegetated to appear naturally vegetated, that are not primary or secondary conservation areas;
        c. Playing fields surfaced with natural turf;
        d. Golf courses identified by the City or County as "green" due to use of best management practices, excluding club houses, parking areas, and other impervious surfaces;
        e. Stormwater management facilities engineered as bioretention areas or wetlands, including easements for such facilities, can comprise a maximum of 10% of required open space.

2Only pursuant to paragraph 6.4.3B, Thoroughfare Density Bonus.

6.4.3 Residential Density
A. Major Roadway Density Bonus Area
For projects located adjacent to streets with a right-of-way over 50 feet in width, the area for the project may be calculated to include that portion of right-of-way in excess of 50 feet for purposes of determining density.
Sample Calculation: A project includes recombination of three lots measuring 75 by 100 feet, and lies adjacent to a right-of-way measuring 80 feet in width.
75 x 100 = 7,500 SF x 3 existing lots = 17,500 SF (standard calculation)
Frontage of 225 feet x 30 feet (in excess of 50-foot ROW) = 6,750 SF Bonus Area
Density Allocation = 24,250 SF (.56 ac.) multiplied by 7.4 units per acre = 4.1 units (4 lots)
[IMAGE: <6.4.3_001.png>]
B. Thoroughfare Density Bonus
    1. Projects located along major or minor thoroughfares, or boulevards, with rights-of-way greater than 50 feet in width can develop as townhouses, using the dimensional provisions of paragraph 7.1.7, Townhouse, so long as the average width of the townhouse lots is at least 20 feet. Projects developed utilizing this option shall meet all of the requirements of Sec. 6.8, Infill Development in Residential Districts, where applicable;
    2. Projects located along major thoroughfares or boulevards, with rights-of-way greater than 50 feet in width can develop as multiplexes, using the dimensional provisions of paragraph 7.1.8, Multiplex. Projects developed utilizing this option shall meet all of the requirements of Sec. 6.8, Infill Development in Residential Districts, where applicable.
C. Lot Averaging
Lot area averaging, as more specifically set forth in Sec. 7.1, Housing Types, is permitted, provided that:
    1. The maximum reduction allowed is 15% of the minimum lot area;
    2. The average area of all lots in the subdivision meets or exceeds the minimum lot area; and
    3. The overall density of the subdivision does not exceed the maximum permitted residential density.

B. Minimum Number of Units Required
Projects must commit to providing affordable housing dwelling units in the amount of at least 15% of the maximum number of units permitted with the base density.
Example #2: If the zoning of a five-acre project allows 60 units/acre, then 300 dwelling units are permitted. To qualify for a density bonus, at least 45 of the 300 dwelling units shall qualify as affordable housing dwelling units.
C. Residential Density
    1. For the purpose of calculating the bonus residential density within projects utilizing the affordable housing bonus, the base density is the maximum density allowed in the zoning district prior to applying any potential bonuses, and multiplied by the gross acreage of the tract of land, including all areas typically excluded from density calculations in Article 8, Environmental Protection. The resulting number shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
    2. For each affordable housing dwelling unit that is constructed, a bonus of two additional dwelling units can be constructed beyond the base density.
    Example #3: The project is in the Urban Tier, and 15% (i.e., 45 units) of the 300 maximum units qualify as affordable housing dwelling units affordable. Thus, an additional 90 dwelling units are allowed above the maximum 300 units, totaling 390 dwelling units.
D. Height
When the affordable housing density bonus is utilized, an additional 15 feet of height shall be allowed.

6.8.2 Yards
A. Street Yards
    1. Context Area
        a. The context area for the required street yard of the subject lot shall be the established street yards (as defined by the distance between the primary structure on each property and the edge of the right-of-way) on residential lots, including structures converted to nonresidential use, with residential zoning along the same block face.
            (1) For the purposes of this section, all lots on both sides along a cul-de-sac or other similar street section shall be considered a block face.
            (2) Corner lots shall be included only if the main entrance of the primary structure on the lot faces the subject block face.
        b. Vacant lots shall apply if the primary structure was demolished after January 1, 2006. GIS maps, demolition documents, and any available surveys shall be used to determine the street yard of the demolished building. If no documentation is available, then the minimum or maximum street yard of the zoning district, as applicable, shall be used.
        c. Flag lots shall not be used for considering street yards. For flag lot yard requirements, see paragraph 6.12.5, Flag Lots.
    2. Required Street Yard
        a. The required street yard shall be any distance between the smallest and largest street yards within the context area. However, in no instance shall the smallest street yard be less than five feet.
        Example: The subject infill lot (B) and four other lots with residential zoning make up the block face. One lot is undeveloped prior to January 1, 2006, and thus shall not be considered. The street yards along the block face of the three other lots are 10 feet (A), 15 feet (C), and 20 feet (D). Therefore, the required street yard for the subject lot (B) can be anywhere between 10 feet (the smallest) and 20 feet (the largest).
        [IMAGE: <6.8.3_002.jpg>]
        b. If there are fewer than two lots that qualify within the context area, then the subject infill lot shall use the base zoning district requirements.
    3. Alleys shall not be considered to create a new block. Parcels on the opposite side of an alley shall be considered along the same block face.
    4. Corner Lots
        a. Each street yard shall be determined separately.
        b. At the discretion of the applicant, the minimum street yard shall be either:
            (1) The average street yard of the nearest two developed parcels (as defined by the distance between the primary structure on each property and the edge of the right-of-way) along the same block face and within the same zoning district; or
            (2) The base zoning district requirement.
B. Side Yards
Porte cocheres can extend into the side yard when incorporated into the design and construction of the primary structure, but in no case shall they be permitted to be closer than three feet from the property line.
C. Landscaping
In addition to required street trees, at least one canopy or understory tree shall be planted or retained on the lot. For planting, the Durham Landscape Manual shall be used for species and planting area.

6.8.3 Buildings
A. Building Width
New construction shall not exceed the average building width for existing residential structures in the context area established in paragraph 6.8.2A.1, Context Area, by more than 25%, unless a building articulation of at least six feet in depth at a point that mimics the average building width in the context area is provided.
B. Building Height
The maximum height of a primary structure shall not exceed the height of the lesser of either of the following:
    1. The maximum height permitted by the zoning district; or
    2. More than 14 feet taller than the shortest height of primary structures on adjacent lots along the block face.
        a. If there is not a primary structure on an adjacent lot, the next lot along the block face shall be used.
        b. If the next lot also lacks a primary structure, then the height of the vacant adjacent lot shall be the maximum allowed by the zoning district.
C. Main Entrance
Except for single-family and two-family residential structures, every principal structure shall have a main entrance on a street other than an alley. On corner lots, the main entrance can face either street or can be oriented toward the corner. For buildings that have more than one main entrance, only one main entrance shall be required to face a street.
D. Garages and Access
    1. Where a lot abuts a publicly improved and maintained alley, all vehicular access shall be taken from the alley.
    2. When a garage entrance faces a street other than an alley, a single garage entrance shall be no more than 22 feet in width.
    3. The construction material of the garage shall match that of the primary structure. This shall not apply if the primary structure is a single-family or two-family structure.
E. Downspouts
For sites in the Urban Tier where no other stormwater controls are required, downspouts shall direct stormwater runoff over pervious area and not piped to right-of-way.

6.8.4 Vehicular Use Areas
A. Residential
    1. No on-site parking is required if placement of a single-family or two-family primary structure, based upon the required street yard, conflicts with the minimum dimensional standards for on-site parking. This parking exemption shall apply to lots measuring 40 feet in width or less.
    2. A vehicular use area includes all surface area designated or utilized for vehicle parking or vehicle access.
    3. The maximum width of the vehicular use area shall be 12 feet; however, the vehicular use area can expand up to 24 feet in width to accommodate garage access or parking. The total additional vehicular use area beyond 12 feet in width shall:
        a. Be behind the front building line;
        b. Be at least 20 feet from the front property line; and
        c. Not exceed 400 square feet.

6.11.1 Purpose
Planned districts shall be established to allow for design flexibility and to encourage efficient use of land and public services and high quality design. These regulations are intended to allow innovative development that is integrated with proposed adjacent uses and compatible with existing patterns of nearby development.

6.11.2 General Requirements
A. A development plan meeting the requirements of paragraph 3.5.6, Development Plan, shall be required as part of the zoning map change application to any planned district, except in the UC and UC-2 districts as indicated below.
B. The initial zonings to establish the UC and UC-2 districts on each campus, which shall be initiated by the appropriate governing body for each university/college campus, shall not require a development plan, though the university or college can submit a development plan providing additional details and restrictions beyond minimum Ordinance requirements, for all or parts of the area associated with the initial zoning map change. A basic zoning map change application shall be required for the initial zoning map change, along with documentation on the availability of adequate parking and a limited surcharge fee to cover public notification requirements.
C. Except in the MU District, uses shall be permitted only in the location shown on the approved development plan. Development of the property shall not begin until a site plan has been approved for that portion of the property. Site plans shall be reviewed for conformance with an approved development plan. Should alterations or changes represent a substantial departure from the approved plan, an amendment is required. The same procedures as required for the original approval shall be required for development plan amendments.
D. Unless alternative standards are explicitly established in the provisions below, all relevant standards and provisions of this Ordinance shall apply to development within any planned district.

6.11.3 Planned Development Residential (PDR)
A. Uses
    1. The primary use allowed within the PDR District shall be residences, including manufactured homes.
    2. Manufactured homes shall be permitted only where they have been expressly indicated on the approved development plan. Manufactured house subdivisions and parks shall be designated as such on the development plan and show lot layouts and the orientation of the house to the street in the development plans.
    3. Nonresidential uses allowed in the PDR District shall be limited to those uses listed in the Sec. 5.1, Use Table. Nonresidential uses can be approved subject to the use limitations established in Sec. 5.3, Limited Use Standards, and the following conditions.
        a. Except for Public and Civic uses pursuant to Sec. 5.1, Use Table, the development shall provide for at least 100 dwelling units. When both nonresidential and residential uses are proposed:
            (1) The dwelling units can be separate structures from the nonresidential uses or located in the same structure as the nonresidential uses.
            (2) To assure that commercial and office uses are supportive of the PDR project, Certificates of Compliance shall be issued for at least 25% of the residential units before Certificates of Compliance are issued for the commercial or office uses. This requirement shall not apply when residences are located in the same building as the commercial or office uses.
        b. Nonresidential acreage shall not be included in any calculations of residential density.
        c. The building heights, location, orientation, and building-to-building spacing, shall be specified in the development plan.
        d. Nonresidential uses shall be located with street access deemed adequate by the City Transportation Department.
        e. Nonresidential square footage shall promote a range of services for residents. Except for Public and Civic uses pursuant to Sec. 5.1, Use Table, the nonresidential component within a PDR shall not exceed 50,000 square feet and shall be devoted to more than one business.
B. Dimensional Requirements
    1. Site Area
        a. The area required for the initial approval of the zoning district shall be as follows:
            (1) Within the Urban Tier, no minimum acreage shall be required.
            (2) Within the Suburban Tier, a minimum of four contiguous acres shall be required.
        b. Additions to an existing approved PDR can be made in increments of any size.
    2. Minimum Lot Area
        a. No minimum lot area shall be required to be specified.
        b. Lot areas described on a development plan may be increased by the appropriate State agency or County Health Department in order to ensure adequate waste treatment.
C. Intensity
    1. Residential Density
    The specific maximum density in units per acre, other than the areas proposed for nonresidential development and areas precluded from consideration for density in paragraphs 8.4.4, Development in Special Flood Hazard Areas and Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas; and 8.8.5, Density Credits, shall be included in the application. The allowable density shall be consistent with the land use designation shown in the  Comprehensive Plan.
    2. Nonresidential Intensity
    The maximum nonresidential intensity shall reflect the CN and/or OI intensity, as appropriate, consistent with Sec. 6.10, Nonresidential District Development Intensity, for the tier in which the project is located.
    3. Height
    Maximum building height shall be 90 feet. Any building over 35 feet shall be identified on the development plan submitted for approval.

    1. Single-Family Detached
    The building envelope for each lot shall be shown on the recorded plat.
    2. Building Separation
        a. Unless alternative building separation standards are established in Article 7, Design Standards, the minimum building separation shall be as follows:
        +---------------------------+---------------------------------------+
        | Height of Taller Building | Distance Between Vertical Projections |
        +---------------------------+---------------------------------------+
        | Under 35 feet             | 10 feet                               |
        +---------------------------+---------------------------------------+
        | 35.1 to 40.0 feet         | 30 feet                               |
        +---------------------------+---------------------------------------+
        | 40.1 to 50.0 feet         | 60 feet                               |

Paragraphs:
6.12.1       Height
6.12.2       Width
6.12.3       Required Yards
6.12.4       Density
6.12.5       Flag Lots

6.12.1 Height
A. Height shall be calculated by the vertical distance from the average of the finished ground level to the finished roof surface of a flat roof or the point at the average height of a roof having a pitch; except for mansard roofs, which shall be measured to the highest finished surface. For buildings with more than one façade along the street, each building façade shall be measured independently. Height for any building with multiple roof levels shall be determined by the highest roof level.
[IMAGE: <6.12.1_001.jpg>]
    1. The average finished ground level shall be calculated by averaging the spot elevations for all building corners on a single structure. Multiple, unattached structures on the same site shall have independently calculated average grade for the purposes of measuring the height of each individual structure.

    2. Required yards and other open areas provided for one lot or structure shall not be considered as providing yard space for another structure or lot.
    3. Required yards shall be calculated from the adjacent property line or street right-of-way. If a new right-of-way width has been established by the adoption of an official transportation planning document, then the yard requirement shall be measured from the proposed right-of-way line.
B. Encroachments into Required Yards
Unless otherwise regulated within this Ordinance, the following encroachment standards shall apply:
Commentary: Easements, other ordinances, or other legally established restrictions may limit encroachments otherwise allowed by this Ordinance.
    1. Chimneys, pre-fabricated chimneys, flues, or smokestacks can extend into yard spaces but shall not occupy more than 30 square feet of the required yard space.

Sec. 7.2 Open Space

Paragraphs:
7.2.1        Purpose
7.2.2        Required Open Space
7.2.3        Design and Use of Required Open Space
7.2.4        Open Space Calculation
7.2.5        Ownership and Management of Open Space

7.2.1 Purpose
Open space adds to the visual character and uniqueness of each development and allows for recreational and aesthetic enjoyment by the residents. In the Rural Tier, open space is intended to serve as land preserved for passive enjoyment. In the Suburban and Urban Tiers, improved open space provides centrally located community gathering spots, and play spaces that are integral to the livability of the neighborhoods, while the preservation of natural areas ensures habitat. In the Compact Neighborhood Tier, a limited quantity of open space is required as relief from the intensity of the built environment. Except for paragraph 7.2.5, Ownership and Management of Open Space, the requirements of this section do not apply to conservation subdivisions under paragraph 6.2.4, Conservation Subdivision.

7.2.2 Required Open Space
A. Open space shall be required in all districts in accordance with Article 6, District Intensity Standards, except that certain residential developments can make payment in lieu of providing required open space provided that the development:
    1. Is not a conservation subdivision under paragraph 6.2.4, Conservation Subdivision;
    2. Is not a cluster subdivision under Sec. 6.7, Cluster Subdivision;
    3. Contains ten or fewer units; and
    4. Contains no engineered stormwater controls.
Payment in lieu of required private open space for recreational purposes under this section is available in addition to payment-in-lieu available under Sec. 12.4, Pedestrian and Bicycle Mobility, and Sec. 12.5, Recreation Land.
B. Payment-in-lieu shall be an amount equivalent to the tax value of the amount of usable property that would have been required for open space. Payments, when authorized, shall be expended within the respective recreation district within which collected.
C. In Cluster Subdivisions, the quantity of open space shall be equal to the reduction in total lot area, in addition to the open space required in the zoning districts in Sec. 6.3, Residential Suburban Development Intensity, Sec. 6.4, Residential Urban Development Intensity, or Sec. 6.5, Residential Compact Development Intensity, as applicable.
D. For Design Districts, all open space requirements shall be pursuant to Article 16, Design Districts, unless otherwise indicated. If conflicts arise between Article 16, Design Districts, and this section, the more stringent regulation shall apply.
E. Cluster Box Units (CBUs)
CBUs, if required, shall be considered a component of any open space. However, all applicable development requirements shall apply.

7.2.3 Design and Use of Required Open Space
A. Recreational Open Space
Where open space is required, at least one-third shall consist of recreational open space.
    1. Table of Recreational Open Space

Sec. 8.1 Purpose
Durham County is endowed with an abundance of natural resources, including land, forests, streams and rivers, lakes, wildlife and natural beauty. Inappropriate development threatens the quality of the natural resources that make it a special place to live and work. Durham's governing bodies recognize that establishing standards for the protection of Durham County's natural resources represents prudent stewardship of the land and good business. The multiple purposes of natural resource protection standards are:
A. To preserve and enhance the quality of the water in rivers, streams, ponds and lakes that flow into and out of Durham County;
B. To minimize future flooding problems by restricting development in flood prone areas;
C. To preserve the water carrying capacity of watercourses and the natural water storage capacity of the floodplain;
D. To protect land and watercourses from pollutants, sedimentation and erosion;
E. To retain open spaces in order to protect their environmentally-sensitive character;
F. To protect and conserve significant natural resources from degradation due to inappropriate development. Such natural resources include Inventory Sites, wildlife and plant life habitats, wetland areas and riparian areas;
G. To minimize the impact of development by controlling the location, intensity, pattern and design of development and construction activities;
H. To enhance the aesthetic appearance of Durham as a means of improving quality of life and attracting new businesses and residents;
I. To improve air quality by reducing the heat island effect by reducing pollution and fossil fuel used for transportation by encouraging walking, bicycling and transit; and
J. To protect environmentally sensitive lands while recognizing the legitimate expectations of property owners and Durham's economic development goals.

8.3.1 Tree Coverage Standards
A. Purpose
The primary purpose of the tree coverage standards is the preservation and maintenance of undisturbed tree cover and the provision of replacement tree cover on development sites in the Urban and Suburban Tiers. Tree coverage serves to reduce glare, noise, air pollution, and soil erosion; to moderate temperatures; to reduce stormwater runoff; to preserve remnants of Durham's native ecology; to provide habitat for native plants and wildlife; to provide a healthy living environment; and to make Durham County a more attractive place to live.
B. Applicability
    1. Tree coverage standards shall only be applied in the Urban and Suburban Tiers.
    2. Developments of less than two acres in size in the Urban Tier shall be exempt from tree coverage requirements if enforceable assurances are provided that no mass grading as defined in Sec. 17.3, Defined Terms, or clear-cutting as defined in paragraph 8.3.4, Clear-Cutting, will be utilized during the development process.
    3. Additions to existing residential structures, excluding multiplexes and apartments, are exempt from tree coverage requirements.
C. Tree Coverage
    1. New development shall include tree coverage areas on a portion of the development tract.
    2. Site plans for additions to development shall provide tree coverage as a percentage of the area proposed for disturbance, unless tree coverage in an amount consistent with the required amounts of this Ordinance was provided on the original site plan for the original development.
    3. Locations
        a. Tree coverage areas in new subdivisions shall be located in common open space or buffers required by other provisions of this Ordinance, except that new subdivisions without buffers that make payment in lieu of required open space under paragraph 7.2.2, Required Open Space, can locate tree coverage areas on private lots or as otherwise specified below.
        b. Any forested land in the floodway, non-encroachment area, floodway fringe, non-encroachment area fringe, or Areas of Shallow Flooding (Zone AO) (unless proposed to be filled or developed in accordance with paragraph 8.4.4, Development in Special Flood Hazard Areas and Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas), preserved wetlands and wetland buffers, steep slope areas, riparian buffers, Durham Natural Inventory Sites, Major Transportation Corridor (MTC) buffers, and any portion of the tract left undisturbed in order to create required perimeter buffers that satisfies the minimum size requirements established in paragraph 8.3.1D , Preserved Tree Coverage, or paragraph 8.3.1E, Replacement Tree Coverage, below can be used as tree cover.
    4. Tree coverage standards can be met either by preserving existing trees on the site, by planting replacement trees, or a combination of both, as required below.
        a. Suburban Tier
        The percentage of a tract which shall have tree coverage is as indicated below. The total tree coverage area shown reflects the addition of replacement tree coverage area to the preserved tree coverage area shown. For certain calculation exclusions in paragraph 8.3.1C.5, Tree Coverage Calculation Exclusions, the total required tree coverage may be adjusted.

            (2) Required Trees on Individual Residential Lots
                (a) In addition to street tree requirements pursuant to Sec. 9.6, Street Trees, an existing tree shall be retained, or a new tree planted, prior to receiving a certificate of compliance for a new primary structure on a single-family or two-family residential lot.
                (b) A planted tree shall be an allowable canopy or understory tree pursuant to the Durham Landscape Manual and comply with the minimum planting area.
            (3) Single-family and two-family residential developments required to meet standards under Sec. 6.8, Infill Development in Residential Districts, shall meet the standards of that section in lieu of the requirements in paragraphs (1) and (2) above.
            (4) All other development shall provide a minimum of three percent tree coverage.
        c. (County Only) SRP-C District
        A minimum of three percent tree coverage is required, and can be provided anywhere within the contiguous zoning area.
    5. Tree Coverage Calculation Exclusions
        a. For the purposes of calculating tree coverage requirements, the following shall be excluded from the total area of the development tract:
            (1) The water surface area of ponds, lakes and other water bodies (excluding stormwater control structures).
            (2) Right-of-way dedication for the widening of existing road right-of-way.
        b. Utility Easements (City Only)
            (1) The exclusion shall only apply to single-family and two-family residential development for the area within a utility easement of record (power, gas, water, or sewer) that measures at least 50 feet in width and exists at the time of application submittal.
            (2) The exclusion shall only be applied to the area calculation for replacement tree coverage and shall allow for adjustment to the overall tree coverage percentage requirement to accommodate the exclusion.
            Example: An application requires tree coverage for a 100-acre development tract, with five acres within a qualifying easement. Per the table in paragraph 8.3.1C.4.a, Suburban Tier, 15% is proposed for tree preservation, therefore requiring eight percent for tree replacement for a total of 23% tree coverage. The exclusion shall be applied as follows:
             15% of 100 acres = 15 acres for tree preservation
             Eight percent of 95 acres (5 acres removed from the 100 acres) = 7.6 acres
             The total tree coverage required = 22.6 acres, or 22.6% (adjusted from the original 23% requirement to accommodate the exclusion)
    6. Tree preservation and tree replacement areas shall be shown on all preliminary plats, final plats, site plans and development plans in order to clearly assign tree replacement responsibility to future owners. Tree preservation and tree replacement areas on any individual lot shall be clearly shown on all plot plans for the lot.
    7. Property owners shall be responsible for protecting and preserving tree preservation and tree replacement areas during and after the development process in accordance with standard horticultural practice and paragraph 8.3.2, Protection of Existing Vegetation.
    8. Trees can satisfy both tree coverage requirements, and landscaping and buffering requirements within Article 9, Landscaping and Buffers, as applicable, as along as all applicable standards can be met.
D. Preserved Tree Coverage
Areas proposed as tree preservation shall meet the following requirements to satisfy the tree coverage standards in paragraph 8.3.1, Tree Coverage and Protection Standards:
    1. The provisions of paragraph 8.3.2, Protection of Existing Vegetation, shall be fulfilled.
    2. Tree preservation areas shall be located in the areas listed in paragraph 8.3.1, Tree Coverage Standards, above. Additional tree preservation areas can be located outside of these areas, in which case they shall be located in order to preserve major specimen trees and to preserve clusters of trees.
    3. Clusters of Trees
        a. The tree coverage area for a cluster of trees shall be determined by the exterior boundary of the total root protection zones for all of the trees in the cluster.
        b. For parcels greater than one acre, no tree preservation area for a cluster of trees shall be counted toward meeting the tree coverage standard unless it includes a minimum of 1,000 square feet (or such smaller area as required by paragraph 8.3.1C.4 above) and has no individual dimension of less than 13 feet. The area protected shall include the entire root protection zone of the tree cluster, and adequate tree protection measures, as defined in paragraph 8.3.2, Protection of Existing Vegetation, shall be taken during the construction and grading of the project.
        c. For parcels one acre or less, no single tree preservation area for a cluster of trees shall be counted toward meeting the tree coverage standard unless it includes a minimum of 500 square feet (or such smaller area as required by paragraph 8.3.1C.4 above) and has no individual dimension less than 13 feet.
        d. At least 60% of the tree coverage included within any tree preservation area shall be composed of trees with at least a one inch dbh as determined through use of landscape sampling pursuant to paragraph 9.3.3, Sampling.
        e. At least 75% of the root protection zone for trees within the cluster measuring at least six inches dbh shall remain undisturbed for it to be considered a protected cluster. Root zones extending into rights-of-way shall be considered disturbed areas, unless legally binding protections are placed upon those areas.
    4. Individual Trees
        a. The tree coverage area for an individual tree shall be determined by the tree's root protection zone.
        b. At least 75% of the root protection zone for an individual tree shall remain undisturbed in order for that tree to count as preserved. Root zones extending into rights-of-way shall be considered disturbed areas, unless legally binding protections are placed upon those areas.
        c. An individual tree can be counted toward tree coverage credit, provided that its diameter is six inches dbh or greater.
    5. Construction in Preserved Tree Coverage Area
        a. Preserved tree coverage areas shall not be used for active recreational purposes, except the following:
            (1) Unpaved walking paths and foot trails constructed with minimal disturbance of tree roots and existing vegetation. No tree eight inches dbh or greater shall be removed for the construction of the trail.
            (2) Paved trails that are public trails and are shown on the most recent version of the Durham Trails and Greenways Master Plan. In no case shall the clearing of the trail corridor exceed 16 feet in width.
            (3) Amenity areas containing such items as picnic tables and benches provided that such areas are unpaved and no larger than 200 square feet or 10% of the tree coverage area, whichever is smaller. No tree eight inches dbh or greater shall be removed for the construction of an amenity area.
        b. All buildings, utilities, and stormwater facilities shall be set back at least 10 feet from the edge of any preserved tree coverage area. No easements, except conservation, greenway, and landscape easements, shall be included within a tree coverage area.
E. Replacement Tree Coverage
Areas proposed as tree replacement shall meet the following requirements to satisfy the standards found in paragraph 8.3.1C, Tree Coverage:
    1. For parcels greater than one acre, no tree replacement area shall be counted toward meeting the tree coverage standard unless it includes a minimum of 1,000 square feet (or such smaller area as required by paragraph 8.3.1C.4 above) and has no individual dimension of less than 25 feet.
    2. For parcels one acre or less, no tree replacement area shall be counted toward meeting the tree coverage standard unless it includes a minimum of 500 square feet (or such smaller area as required by paragraph 8.3.1C.4 above) and has no individual dimension less than 15 feet.
    3. When replacement trees are provided in order to satisfy the requirements of paragraph 8.3.1C, Tree Coverage, coverage credit shall be accrued in accordance with the following table with credit calculated based on the required planting area for the proposed trees.

    4. At least 50% of replacement trees shall be one inch caliper or greater.
    5. A minimum of 50% of replacement trees shall be hardwood canopy species native to Durham County. The remainder of the replacement trees shall be a mix of canopy and understory hardwood and non-hardwood species, as long as no more than 50% of this remainder is pines.
    6. Replacement trees shall be provided as a mix of species, in accordance with the standards set in paragraph 9.2.3B.6, Mixing of Tree Species, and shall consist of species allowed for Tree Coverage in tables 1A through 1H within the Landscape Manual for Durham, North Carolina.
    7. At least 75% of the replacement trees planted to augment preserved tree coverage clusters pursuant to paragraph 8.3.1D.3, Clusters of Trees, shall be native understory hardwoods of one inch caliper or greater.
    8. Areas designated as replacement tree coverage shall be subject to the use limitations imposed on preserved tree coverage in paragraph 8.3.1D.5, Construction in Preserved Tree Coverage Areas, except that stormwater control measures designed as bioretention facilities shall be allowed.
    9. Replacement trees shall be planted before any Certificate of Compliance is issued, unless the planting has been deferred to an appropriate season in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 9.11.2, Extensions for All Other Development.

8.3.2 Protection of Existing Vegetation
Any trees preserved on a development tract in order to meet Ordinance requirements or otherwise indicated to be preserved shall meet the following protection standards.
A. Protection measures to be used during grading and construction, including details of the tree protection fence(s) and its location(s), shall be shown on the site, landscape, grading, utility, demolition, and erosion control plans.
B. Root protection zones shall be established around all trees to be preserved. The root protection zone shall either be a six-foot radius around the tree or a one foot radius for every inch of tree dbh, whichever is greater.
C. A tree protection fence constructed of a material resistant to degradation by sun, wind, and moisture for the duration of the construction, shall be installed at the same time as the erosion control measures, and shall remain in place until all construction is complete. Such fencing shall be mounted on metal posts placed no further than ten feet apart. Silt fencing shall not serve as tree protection fencing.
D. At the start of grading involving the lowering of the existing grade around a tree or stripping of topsoil, a clean, sharp, vertical cut shall be made at the edge of the tree save area at the same time as other erosion control measures are installed. Tree protection fencing shall be installed on the side of this cut farthest away from the tree trunk. This procedure shall be incorporated as a note on the grading and erosion control plans.
E. No storage of materials, dumping of waste materials, fill, or parking of equipment shall be allowed within the root protection zone, and no trespassing shall be allowed within the boundary of the root protection zone, and shall be so noted on the grading and erosion control plans and posted at each end of the tree protection fence with perimeter signs spaced a maximum of 100 feet on center thereafter. Each sign shall read no trespassing/tree protection area and prohibido entrar/zona protectora para los arboles.

8.3.3 Tree Survey
A. Purpose
The primary purpose of the tree survey requirements is to provide better information about the presence and location of significant trees on sites proposed for development. This information is needed before plans for development are so far advanced that it is unreasonable and impractical to modify the plans to protect the trees identified on the tree survey. Knowing the location and size of major specimen trees helps the staff and governing body evaluate possible modifications to the proposed plans to preserve significant trees and improve the appearance of proposed development.
B. Land Disturbance Tree Survey
    1. A land disturbance tree survey shall be required for any area for which the limits of disturbance are within 30 feet of a preserved tree coverage area, floodplain, steep slope area, riparian buffer, required landscape buffer, inventory site, wetland, or conservation area.
    2. The land disturbance tree survey shall show the specific location, species, size and root protection zone of any tree(s) six inches dbh or greater that is within 30 feet of any area proposed for disturbance, and meets the qualifications in the above paragraph.
    3. The land disturbance tree survey shall be shown on all site, grading, and erosion control plans, as well as preliminary plats.
    4. The survey shall be prepared in accordance with paragraph 9.2.4, Landscape Plans and Surveys.

8.3.4 Clear-Cutting
A. Standard
Properties shall not be clear-cut during the conduct of forestry activities. To maintain the visual character of the site from adjoining properties and right-of-way, a vegetated perimeter buffer shall be maintained while tree harvesting for forestry occurs. A 32-foot wide buffer of naturally existing vegetation shall be maintained along all boundaries of the property being forested that adjoin other properties. Along public rights-of-way, a 50-foot buffer of naturally existing vegetation shall be maintained, exclusive of areas required for access to the site.
B. Penalties
    1. City
    Site plans proposing development of properties on which all or substantially all of the trees protected in a 32-foot buffer required under this section, a 50-foot buffer required under this section, or both, are removed shall be denied for a period of three years from the date of removal or five years from the date of removal if removal is a willful violation of this section.
    2. County
    Site plans proposing development of properties on which all or substantially all of the trees protected in a 32-foot buffer required under this section, a 50-foot buffer required under this section, or both, are removed shall be denied for a period of three years from the date of removal.

8.3.5 Major Specimen Trees
A. A major specimen tree shall be defined pursuant to Sec. 17.3, Defined Terms.
B. Major specimen trees that are saved and protected under the requirements of paragraph 8.3.2 shall be granted tree coverage credit at one and one-half times the size of the root protection zone. Major specimen trees that are located in the floodway, non-encroachment area, floodway fringe, non-encroachment area fringe, or Areas of Shallow Flooding (Zone AO) (unless proposed to be filled or developed in accordance with paragraph 8.4.4, Development in Special Flood Hazard Areas and Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas), preserved wetlands and wetland buffers, steep slope areas, riparian buffers, Major Transportation Corridor (MTC) buffers, and Durham Natural Inventory Sites are not eligible for additional credit as described above.
C. In order to receive additional credit for major specimen trees, a major specimen tree survey shall be required showing specific location, species, size, and root protection zone of all specimen trees to be saved. This survey shall be included on all site, landscape, grading, utility, demolition, and erosion control plans.

Sec. 8.4 Floodplain and Flood Damage Protection Standards

Paragraphs:
8.4.1        Purpose
8.4.2        Applicability
8.4.3        Standards
8.4.4        Development in Special Flood Hazard Areas and Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas

8.4.1 Purpose
The primary purpose of the floodplain and flood damage protection standards is to preserve and maintain the natural floodplain in an undisturbed vegetated state in order to maintain flood storage capacity, control stormwater, improve water quality and conserve plant and wildlife habitat. Additionally, these standards serve to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas.
In addition, this section serves to facilitate implementation of the Federal Flood Insurance Program and to minimize the possibility that new construction will sustain damage from flooding by:
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses that are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, or other development that may increase erosion or flood damage;
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other lands;
F. Minimizing damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; and
G. Ensuring that property owners and potential property owners are notified that property is a Special Flood Hazard Area or Future Conditions Flood Hazard Area.
Commentary: Losses in floodprone areas are the result of the cumulative effects of obstructions, removal of vegetative cover, and construction practices that cause an increase in flood heights and velocities. Increased flood heights and velocities create a greater threat to land uses and structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or are otherwise unprotected from flood damage. Occupancy in flood prone areas by uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards can result in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur. Actual flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the Special Flood Hazard Areas and Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of Durham City or County or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

8.4.2 Applicability
This section shall apply to all Special Flood Hazard Areas and Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas within the City and County of Durham as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or produced under the Cooperating Technical State (CTS) agreement between the State of North Carolina and FEMA in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated December 6, 2019, for Durham County, and its accompanying flood maps, such as the Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) (FIRM) for the City of Durham and Durham County dated May 2, 2006; February 2, 2007; April 16, 2007; June 4, 2007; August 2, 2007; May 16, 2008; October 19, 2018; or December 6, 2019, as applicable. These maps are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance and all revisions thereto after January 1, 2021. Subsequent Letter of Map Revisions (LOMRs) and/or Physical Map Revisions (PMRs) shall be adopted. Also adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance are associated Physical Map Revisions and Letters of Map Change issued by FEMA as of December 6, 2019. The Special Flood Hazard Areas and Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas also include those defined through standard engineering analysis for private developments or by governmental agencies, but which have not yet been incorporated in the FIRM. This includes, but is not limited to, detailed flood data:
A. Generated as a requirement of paragraphs 3.21.2B.11 and 12, Duties and Responsibilities;
B. Preliminary FIRMs where more stringent than the effective FIRM; or
C. Post-disaster Flood Recovery Maps.

8.4.3 Standards
A. General
In all Special Flood Hazard Areas and Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas the following provisions are required:
    1. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure;
    2. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;

    4. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. These include but are not limited to HVAC equipment, water softener units, bath/kitchen fixtures, ductwork, electric meter panels/boxes, utility/cable boxes, appliances (i.e., washers, dryers, refrigerator, etc.), hot water heaters, electric outlets/switches;
    5. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
    6. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters;
    7. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
    8. Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which is in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance, shall meet the requirements of new construction; and
    9. New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not be permitted. A structure or tank for chemical or fuel storage incidental to an allowed use or to the operation of a water treatment plant or wastewater treatment facility can be located in a Special Flood Hazard Area only if the structure or tank is either elevated or floodproofed to at least the regulatory flood protection elevation and certified according to the certification requirements in Sec. 3.21, Floodplain Development Permit.
    10. Fill material shall be used for all new construction and substantial improvements to create an elevation that is two feet above base flood elevation or future conditions flood elevation, except as otherwise authorized pursuant to paragraph 8.4.4, Development in Special Flood Hazard Areas and Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas. The fill material shall be required to extend for a distance of 40 feet from the exterior walls of a building. Where the distance to the property line is less than 40 feet, the fill shall extend to the property line. The required fill material distance shall include a sloped edge with a maximum 3:1 slope [for example, for a fill three feet deep: 31 feet of flat fill plus nine feet of sloped fill] or a retaining wall in lieu of the slope [for example, a side yard of flat fill and a retaining wall]. Residential accessory structures which are defined as nonhabitable structures by the North Carolina Building Code are exempt from requirements to extend the fill material away from the base but are required to be placed on fill which is two feet, or five feet in Zone A, above base flood elevation. Exceptions from any of these requirements resulting from special storm water considerations shall be forwarded to the approving authority if other than the Floodplain Administrator, with a recommendation from the Floodplain Administrator.
    11. Nothing in this ordinance shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of this ordinance and located totally or partially within the floodway or non-encroachment area, provided there is no additional encroachment below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation in the floodway or non-encroachment area, and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this ordinance.
    12. When a structure is partially located in a Special Flood Hazard Area, the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction and substantial improvements.
    13. When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in a flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest Base Flood Elevation (BFE) shall apply.
B. Specific Standards
In all Special Flood Hazard Areas where Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data has been provided and in Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas where future conditions flood elevations data has been provided, as set forth in paragraph 8.4.2, Applicability, or paragraph 3.21.2B (11 and 12), Duties and Responsibilities, the following provisions are required:

            (4) have Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data provided if development is greater than the lesser of five (5) acres or fifty (50) lots/manufactured home sites. Such Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference per paragraph 8.4.2, Applicability, to be utilized in implementing this code.
    2. Residential Construction
    New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation.
    3. Non-Residential Construction
    New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial (other than hazardous, solid waste, salvage yards, chemical storage facilities or similar uses which are prohibited) or other non-residential structure shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. Structures located in AE and X (Future) Zones can be floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required flood protection elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in the certification requirements in Sec. 3.21, Floodplain Development Permit.
    4. Manufactured Homes
        a. New or replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation.
        b. Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement in accordance with the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured/Mobile Homes, 1995 Edition, and any revision thereto adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to NCGS §143-143.15 or a certified engineered foundation. Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis thirty-six (36) inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength. When the elevation of the chassis is above thirty-six (36) inches in height, an engineering certification is required.
        c. All foundation enclosures or skirting shall be in accordance with paragraph 8.4.3B.5, Elevated Buildings.
        d. All new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within Special Flood Hazard Areas or Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas shall prepare an evacuation plan for evacuation of all residents. The plan shall be filed with the Inspections Director, or designee (as the Floodplain Administrator) and the Emergency Management Coordinator prior to the time of site plan approval, plat approval, or building permit, if site plans or plats are not required.
        e. Manufactured homes, except replacement manufactured homes located in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, shall not be permitted in the floodway or non-encroachment area. Permitted manufactured homes shall be subject to the non-encroachment standards of paragraph 8.4.3E, Floodway and Non-Encroachment Areas.
    5. Elevated Buildings
    New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas that are below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall not be designed to be used for human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials below the regulatory flood protection level in Zone AE and X Zone (Future) and meet the following design criteria:
        a. Measures for complying with this requirement shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the foundation must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum design criteria:
            (1) Provide a minimum of two openings on different sides of each enclosed area subject to flooding.
            (2) The total net area of all openings must be at least one (1) square inch for each square foot of each enclosed area subject to flooding.
            (3) If a building has more than one enclosed area, each area must have openings on exterior walls to allow floodwater to directly enter;
            (4) The bottom of all required openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above the adjacent grade; and
            (5) Openings can be equipped with screens, louvers, or other opening coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. For purposes of this provision, vinyl or sheet metal skirting shall not be considered an enclosure for regulatory and flood insurance rating purposes and therefore shall not require hydrostatic openings.
        b. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms, except to enclose storage areas.
    6. Additions/Improvements
        a. Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are:
            (1) not a substantial improvement the addition and/or improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-conforming than the existing structure; or
            (2) a substantial improvement, the existing structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new construction.
        b. Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the existing structure shall require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
        c. Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures whereas the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are:
            (1) not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction; or
            (2) a substantial improvement, the existing structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new construction.
        d. Where a fire wall or independent perimeter load-bearing wall is provided between the addition and the existing building, the addition(s) shall be considered a separate building and only the addition must comply with the standards for new construction.
    7. Recreational Vehicles
    Recreational vehicles shall not be located within Special Flood Hazard Areas or Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas for 180 days or more and shall be licensed and ready for highway use (on wheels attached to a site by quick-disconnect type utilities with no permanently attached additions). Recreational vehicles not meeting these standards shall meet the standards of manufactured homes above.
    8. Temporary Structures
    Prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, Applicants must submit to the Floodplain Administrator a written plan for the removal of such structure(s) in the event of a hurricane or flash flood warning notification. The plan must include the following information:
        a. a proposed time period for which the temporary use will be permitted;
        b. the name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible for the removal of the temporary structure;
        c. the time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be removed (i.e. minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or immediately upon flood warning notification);
        d. a copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with a trucking company to ensure the availability of removal equipment when needed; and
        e. designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside the Special Flood Hazard Area or Future Conditions Flood Hazard Area to which the temporary structure will be moved.
    9. Accessory Structures
    When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages, etc.) are to be placed within a Special Flood Hazard Area or Future Conditions Flood Hazard Area, the following criteria shall be met:
        a. Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation (including work, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas);
        b. Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage potential;
        c. Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;

        f. Openings to relieve hydrostatic pressure during a flood shall be provided below regulatory flood protection elevation in conformance with elevated building requirements in paragraph 8.4.3, Standards; and
        g. An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet does not require an elevation or floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing certifications are required for all other accessory structures in accordance with the certification requirements in Sec. 3.21, Floodplain Development Permit.
C. Floodplains without Base Flood Elevations
Within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in paragraph 8.4.2, Applicability, where no Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data has been provided, the following provisions shall apply:
    1. No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20 feet each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
    2. The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be determined based on one of the following criteria set in priority order:
        a. If Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this ordinance and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in paragraph 3.21.2B (11&12).
        b. All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development proposals shall provide Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data if development is greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference per paragraph 8.4.2, Standards, to be utilized in implementing this ordinance. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) shall be required prior to the approval of construction drawings for development requiring BFE data to be provided.
        c. When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is not available from a Federal, State, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be elevated to or above five feet above the highest adjacent grade.
D. Floodplains with Base Flood Elevations but no Established Floodway or Non-Encroachment Areas
Along rivers and streams where Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is provided but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are identified for a Special Flood Hazard Area on the FIRM or in the FIS, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.
E. Floodway and Non-Encroachment Areas
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in paragraph 8.4.2, Applicability, are areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas, which are extremely hazardous due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential projectiles. In such areas no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) authorizes conditional approval of the proposed encroachment via a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) or a professional engineer registered in the State of North Carolina certifies that such uses will result in no increases in flood levels during the occurrence of a base flood, as demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice if required by the Floodplain Administrator.
F. Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (Zone AO)
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in paragraph 8.4.2, Applicability, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to the general standards in 8.4.3A, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the following requirements.
    1. The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a freeboard of two feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least five feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
    2. Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be floodproofed to the same level as required in paragraph 8.4.3F.1 so that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below that level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required as per paragraph 3.21.6, Certification Requirements, and paragraph 8.4.3B.3, Non-Residential Construction.
    3. Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

8.4.4 Development in Special Flood Hazard Areas and Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas
A. General
    1. Development and land disturbing activity within Special Flood Hazard Areas and Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas shall be prohibited, except as provided below.
    2. The Floodplain Administrator and the Board of Adjustment, as applicable, shall not approve development that is located below the regulatory flood protection elevation if such development is otherwise required to be located at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or is not permitted within the Special Flood Hazard Areas or Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas.
    3. Development addressed under paragraph 8.4.3C, Floodplains without Base Flood Elevations, and paragraph 8.4.3D, Floodplains with Base Flood Elevations but no Established Floodway or Non-Encroachment Areas, shall be deemed floodway development for purposes of this section.
B. Development Allowed
Land can be used for the following purposes, with no special approvals required:
    1. Agricultural uses, including active agriculture, pasture forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farms, and similar uses; and
    2. Lawns and gardens.
C. Development Requiring Floodplain Administrator Approval
The following shall only require Floodplain Administrator approval in association with any applicable site plan, plat, construction drawings, or building permit approval.
    1. Development of, or substantial improvements to, a single-family or duplex structure, and associated site improvements such as accessory structures, driveways, walkways, and utility crossings, on a single lot of record recorded on or before January 1, 2006, or recorded prior to being mapped in the floodway fringe, non-encroachment area fringe, or Areas of Shallow Flooding (Zone AO). Such projects can utilize fill, pursuant to a floodplain development permit per Sec. 3.21, Floodplain Development Permit, in the floodway fringe, non-encroachment area fringe, or Zone AO.
    2. Floodproofing or elevation by design in lieu of required fill for new construction or substantial improvements on lots of record that were recorded on or before January 1, 2006, pursuant to a floodplain development permit issued under Sec. 3.21, Floodplain Development Permit. If the Floodplain Administrator approves floodproofed or elevated-by-design construction or improvements rather than use of fill in Zone AE or Zone X (Future), the approval shall specify the minimum foundation opening requirements and limitations on below-BFE enclosures uses, if applicable.
    3. Development with a valid site plan or preliminary plat approval prior to the most recent and applicable Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) (FIRM) for Durham County. This shall also include any necessary site plan or preliminary plat amendment that is a result of the impacts of the FIRM.

8.5.1 Purpose
The primary purpose of Sec. 8.5, Riparian Buffer Protection Standards (which may be referred to herein as this section) is to maintain land adjacent to surface waters in a vegetated state in order to enhance and maintain water quality, protect stream channel wetlands, minimize stormwater runoff, reduce sedimentation and erosion, provide nutrient removal, conserve plant and wildlife habitat and protect wildlife movement corridors.

8.5.2 Applicability
This section shall apply to any person or entity conducting activities within the City or County of Durham, except where such activities are otherwise regulated by the State of North Carolina or the United States. Outside of the Neuse River Basin, activities otherwise regulated by the State include forest harvesting and agricultural activities, activities conducted by a local, state, or federal government, and activities under multiple jurisdictions except where such multiple jurisdictions are the City and County of Durham exclusively. This section shall supersede all locally implemented buffer requirements stated in 15A NCAC 02B .0214 through .0216 as applied to WS-II, WS-III, and WS-IV waters in the Jordan watershed. Where any requirement of this section conflicts with any other valid law, the most stringent requirement shall apply.
The requirements of this section shall apply in all cases, including where State standards are less stringent. Review and approval by the City or County is always required, except in the case of an exempt use, and shall occur pursuant to the applicable process in each case (e.g., Preliminary Plat, Major Site Plan, etc.). Within the Neuse River Basin, final review by the City or County shall occur after any State action is completed.

8.5.3 Definitions
Within the Neuse River Basin, the definitions contained or referenced in 15A NCAC 02B .0233 and .0242 shall apply to this section. Outside of the Neuse River Basin, the definitions contained or referenced in 15A NCAC 02B .0263, .0267, and .0268 shall apply to this section. Such definitions shall supersede any conflicting UDO definition for purposes of this section.

8.5.4 Riparian Buffers Protected
A. Regulated Activities
This section shall apply to any activity conducted within any riparian buffer, and to any activity conducted outside of any riparian buffer that has hydrologic impacts upon that buffer in violation of the diffuse flow requirements of paragraph 8.5.5, Diffuse Flow Requirements. There is no disturbed area minimum for regulated activities and they include but are not limited to activities conducted pursuant to building permits. As stated in paragraph 8.5.2, Applicability, compliance with this entire section is required even where State standards are less stringent. Within the Neuse River Basin, final review by the City or County shall occur after any State action is completed.
B. Buffers Protected
    1. General Riparian Buffers
    Riparian buffers as depicted on the table below shall be required adjacent to the following surface waters: intermittent streams; perennial streams; modified natural streams; lakes; and ponds including beaver ponds. The table includes the additional buffer width required for certain surface waters in watershed protection overlays. It does not include the 10-foot setback required under paragraph 8.5.9C below. A lake or pond shall receive the same buffer as the stream to which it is connected at the point of initial connection. A gap of 300 feet or less in a stream, as determined by the City or County, shall receive the same buffer as the upstream portion of such stream.
    Commentary: UDO Sec. 17.3, Defined Terms, defines adjacent as [p]roperty abutting directly on the boundary of, touching, or sharing a common point. The applicable state rules define modified natural stream as an on-site channelization or relocation of a stream channel and subsequent relocation of the intermittent or perennial flow as evidenced by topographic alterations in the immediate watershed. A modified natural stream must have the typical biological, hydrological, and physical characteristics commonly associated with the conveyance of water.Key:

    1Stream buffer minimum of 100 feet if a high density option is utilized per paragraph 8.7.2B.1
    2. Riparian Reservoir Buffers
    Riparian buffers shall be required adjacent to reservoirs pursuant to Sec. 8.6, Water Supply Reservoir Buffer.
    3. Riparian Wetland Buffers
    Riparian buffers shall be required adjacent to wetlands pursuant to Sec. 8.9, Wetlands Protection Standards.
    4. Wetlands adjacent to, or within 50 feet of, surface waters shall be considered part of the riparian buffers but are regulated pursuant to 15A NCAC 2B .0230 and .0231, 15A NCAC 2H .0500, 15A NCAC 2H .1300, and Sections 401 and 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.
C. Buffer Measurement
Riparian buffers shall be measured as follows:
    1. For intermittent and perennial streams, begin at the top of the bank and extend landward the required distance on all sides of the surface water, measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to a vertical line marking the top of the bank;
    2. For ponds, lakes and reservoirs located within a natural drainage way, begin at the normal water level and extend landward the required distance, measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to a vertical line marking the normal water level;
    3. Where an intermittent or perennial stream begins or ends, including but not limited to when it goes underground, enters or exits a culvert, or enters or exits a wetland, begin at the top of the bank and extend landward the required distance in a radius around the beginning or end; and
    Commentary: The radius requirement does not apply to a continuous stream that flows through a culvert within an existing stream buffer.
    4. Where an intermittent, perennial, or modified natural stream contains a gap of 300 feet or less, as determined by the City or County, extend the upstream buffer in a straight line through the gap, or in an alternative manner if approved by the Planning Director or designee, until it meets the downstream buffer.
D. Buffer Identification
    1. Riparian buffers shall be clearly indicated on all development plans, site plans, preliminary plats, final plats, sedimentation and erosion control plans, any other plans required before, during, or after construction, and any other documents as required under applicable law or policy.
    2. Signs or other mechanisms that clearly demarcate riparian buffer boundaries shall be required for all new development or redevelopment.
        a. Temporary signs shall be installed before clearing and grading begins and maintained until permanent signs are installed. Tree save or silt fencing may be used in lieu of temporary signs with prior approval from the City or County as appropriate.
        b. Permanent signs shall be installed prior to issuance of certificate of occupancy and maintained in perpetuity.
        c. All signs shall be posted at intervals of one per parcel or every 50 feet, whichever is less.
        d. Each sign shall be [at least, City only] four inches by six inches in size, shall face away from the buffer, and shall read Riparian Buffer  Do Not Disturb Except as Authorized by the City [County] of Durham.
        e. All signs must be placed on metal or wood posts installed securely in the ground, except that permanent signs may be placed on permanent fencing along the buffer boundary. If wood posts are used they must be at least two inches by two inches in size and be made of treated wood. Posts must extend a minimum of three feet above ground and be sunk at least two feet below ground.

8.5.5 Diffuse Flow Requirements
Diffuse flow shall be maintained in riparian buffers by dispersing concentrated flow prior to its entry into a buffer and reestablishing vegetation as listed below. These requirements apply to all development, including development that does not propose to impact or conduct an activity within a riparian buffer.
A. Concentrated runoff from new ditches or man-made conveyances shall be converted to diffuse flow at non-erosive velocities before the runoff enters a riparian buffer except as authorized under paragraph 8.5.10, Uses.
B. Corrective action to restore diffuse flow shall be taken as necessary and shall be designed to impede the formation of erosion gullies.
C. New stormwater conveyances including drainage ditches, roadside ditches, and stormwater BMPs shall not be allowed in or through riparian buffers except as authorized under paragraph 8.5.10, Uses.

8.5.6 Maps and On-Site Determinations
A. Maps
All of the following maps shall be used to identify surface water subject to the requirements of this section:
    1. The most recent version of the soil survey map prepared by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, which means the most recent hard copy paper bound map or CD-ROM or PDF of such map; and
    2. The most recent version of the 1:24,000 scale (7.5 minute) quadrangle topographic map prepared by the United States Geologic Survey (USGS); and
    3. Outside of the Neuse River Basin, any map approved by the Geographic Information Coordinating Council, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission and both governing bodies as more accurate than the maps listed in paragraphs 1 and 2 above. However, such map shall not be used for buffer delineation on projects that are existing and ongoing under paragraph 8.5.7, Existing Use Exemption.
    Surface water shall be deemed present if it is at least approximately shown on any map. If any surface water is depicted differently on different maps, the most restrictive depiction shall apply.
B. On-Site Determinations
    1. Within the Neuse River Basin
    A landowner or other affected party who believes that surface water is inaccurately depicted shall consult the North Carolina Division of Water Resources (Division) and may request an on-site determination by the Division.
    2. Outside the Neuse River Basin
        a. The Division or another party may request an on-site determination by the City or County as appropriate of the specific origination point of a stream where it is in question.
        b. A landowner or other affected party, including the Division, who believes that one or more maps inaccurately depict, or omit based on site-specific evidence, surface water shall consult the City or County as appropriate and may request an on-site determination by the City or County.
        c. When an on-site determination is requested, a City or County representative, or other party authorized or accepted by the City or County, who has successfully completed the Divisions Surface Water Identification Training Certification course, its successor, or other equivalent training curriculum approved by the Division, shall make the on-site determination following submission of any fees, information or documents required by the City or County. An origination point shall be established using the latest version of the Division publication, Identification Methods for the Origins of .
        d. A City or County representative, or other party authorized or accepted by the City or County, who has successfully completed the training required above may also make either type of on-site determination absent an outside consultation or request.
        e. An on-site determination shall be valid for five years from the date of the determination unless specified otherwise therein.
    3. Surface water shown on a map shall be exempt from Sec. 8.5, Riparian Buffer Protection Standards, if it is determined on site to be: 1) a manmade pond or lake located outside of a natural drainage way, meaning the pond or lake is not fed by, and has no direct discharge to, an intermittent or perennial stream; 2) an ephemeral stream; 3) not present on the ground, except for any stream gap of 300 feet or less; or 4) a ditch or other manmade conveyance other than a modified natural stream unless constructed for navigation or boat access.
    4. Surface water not shown on a map shall be governed by Sec. 8.5, Riparian Buffer Protection Standards, if it is determined on site to be: 1) a pond or lake located in a natural drainage way, meaning the pond or lake is fed by and has a direct discharge to an intermittent or perennial stream; 2) a perennial stream, including any gap of 300 feet or less; 3) an intermittent stream, including any gap of 300 feet or less; or 4) a modified natural stream, including any gap of 300 feet or less.
    5. Despite the provisions of Section 2.4, Board of Adjustment, any dispute shall be referred to the Division Director c/o the 401 Oversight Express Permitting Unit, or its successor, in writing. The Directors determination is subject to review as provided in Articles 3 and 4 of G.S. 150B.

8.5.7 Existing Use Exemption
A. General
This section shall not apply to the portion of a riparian buffer occupied by the footprint of a legal existing and ongoing use. An existing and ongoing use is a use that was present within the riparian buffer as of July 22, 1997 within the Neuse River Basin, or as the effective date of this section outside of the Neuse River Basin, and has continued to exist since that time. Such uses may include but are not limited to agriculture, buildings, industrial facilities, commercial areas, transportation facilities, maintained lawns, utility lines and on-site sanitary sewage systems. A use that converts from an existing and ongoing use to another use shall no longer be exempt. Conversion includes but is not limited to changing an agricultural operation to non-agricultural use, failing to maintain a lawn, or failing to meet the criteria specified below for activities allowed.
B. Exemption Maintained
The following activities do not convert an existing and ongoing use to another use:
    1. Activities necessary to maintain a use provided that no impervious surface is added to the riparian buffer where it did not exist as of the applicable date, existing diffuse flow is maintained, and either 1) outside of the Neuse River Basin, the site remains similarly vegetated, or 2) within the Neuse River Basin, no additional vegetation is removed except that grazed or trampled by livestock;
    2. Grading and revegetating of the outer 20 feet of a buffer that is not located in a watershed protection overlay, provided that the health of the vegetation in the inner 30 feet of the buffer is not compromised, the ground is stabilized and existing diffuse flow is maintained; or
    3. Outside of the Neuse River Basin, change of ownership through purchase or inheritance.
C. Outside the Neuse River Basin
Outside of the Neuse River Basin, a project that meets at least one of the following criteria is also existing and ongoing:
    1. The project requires a 401 Certification and 404 Permit and they were issued prior to the effective date of this section;
    2. The project requires a state permit (e.g., landfill, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) wastewater discharge, land application of residuals, road construction activity), has started construction or is under contract to start construction, and received all required state permits and certifications prior to the effective date of this section;
    3. The project is reviewed through the Clean Water Act Section 404/National Environmental Policy Act Merger 01 Process or its immediate successor and reached agreement with the NC Department of Environmental Quality on avoidance and minimization prior to the effective date of this section; or
    4. The project can avoid review under the Clean Water Act Section 404/National Environmental Policy Act Merger 01 Process or its immediate successor due to a Finding of No Significant Impact and received written approval from the City or County as appropriate prior to the effective date of this section.
D. Development of Existing Single-Family Lots within the Neuse River Basin under Certain Conditions
    1. Applicability
    Where application of the Neuse River Basin riparian buffer requirements would preclude construction of a single-family residence and necessary infrastructure, such as an on-site wastewater system, the single-family residence may encroach into the buffer if all of the following criteria are met.
        a. The lot was platted and recorded prior to August 1, 2000.
        b. The lot area is two acres or less.
        c. The lot is adjacent to the buffered surface waters.
        d. The lot is not within a watershed protection overlay, or the lot is within a watershed protection overlay but was recorded prior to the effective date of the applicable watershed protection overlay.
    2. If documentation demonstrates the lot meets all of the above criteria, then a single-family residence can encroach into the buffer with the following conditions:
        a. The residence is set back the maximum feasible distance from the top of the bank, rooted herbaceous vegetation, normal high-water level, or normal water level, whichever is applicable, on the existing lot and designed to minimize encroachment into the riparian buffer;
        b. The residence is set back a minimum of 30 feet landward of the top of the bank, rooted herbaceous vegetation, normal high-water level, or normal water level, whichever is applicable;
        c. Stormwater generated by new impervious surface within the riparian buffer is treated, and diffuse flow of stormwater is maintained through the buffer; and
        d. If the residence will be served by an on-site wastewater system, no part of the septic tank or drain field shall encroach into the riparian buffer.
    3. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, a buffer authorization is required for any encroachments into the riparian buffer.

8.5.8 Piping Streams
Piping of streams is prohibited except where necessary to accomplish a use that is authorized under paragraph 8.5.10, Uses, and approved as required.
Commentary: Approved piping is a use within an existing buffer and the buffer remains in effect. There is no gap in the buffer, so buffer requirements apply along the piped portion of the stream.

8.5.9 Uses
A. As stated in paragraph 8.5.2, Applicability, compliance with this entire section is required even where State standards are less stringent. Within the Neuse River Basin, final review by the City or County shall occur after any State action is completed.
B. No new clearing, grading, or development shall take place nor shall any new building permits be issued in violation of this section. Parties subject to this section shall abide by all state rules and laws regarding waters of the state including but not limited to 15A NCAC 2B .0230 and .0231, 15A NCAC 2H .0500, 15A NCAC 2H .1300, and Sections 401 and 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.
C. Buildings and other features that require grading and construction shall be set back at least ten feet from the edge of the riparian buffer. When an encroachment into a riparian buffer is permitted either by right, through required authorization, or from approval of a variance, grading and construction necessary for that encroachment shall be allowed within the set back.
D. Any use authorized by this section shall be designed, constructed and maintained to minimize the amount of intrusion into the riparian buffer and to minimize clearing, grading, erosion, water quality degradation, and damage to vegetation.
E. Where any use involves temporary land clearing, revegetation shall occur pursuant to an approved vegetation plan. Such plan shall include trees as specified under paragraph 9.2.3B.6, Mixing of Tree Species, and the Durham Landscape Manual, planted at a density sufficient to provide 320 trees per acre at maturity with at least 50% of those trees having the potential of attaining a two and a half inch or greater dbh within seven years.
F. Use Category Requirements
    1. Exempt
    An exempt use may occur without authorization provided it adheres to the limitations contained in the Table of Uses below. In addition, an exempt use shall be designed, constructed, maintained and monitored to minimize soil disturbance and maximize water quality protection.
    2. Allowable
    An allowable use requires written authorization from the North Carolina Division of Water Resources, City, or County as appropriate and may occur following a finding of no practical alternatives and issuance of an Authorization Certificate pursuant to paragraph 8.5.10, No Practical Alternatives/Authorization Certificate.
    3. Allowable with Mitigation
    An allowable with mitigation use requires written authorization from the North Carolina Division of Water Resources, City, or County as appropriate and may occur following a finding of no practical alternatives and issuance of an Authorization Certificate pursuant to paragraph 8.5.10, No Practical Alternatives/Authorization Certificate, and approval of a mitigation strategy pursuant to paragraph 8.5.11, Mitigation.
G. Table of Uses
The following table sets out potential new uses within the riparian buffer, or outside of the buffer with impacts upon the buffer, and categorizes them as exempt, allowable, or allowable with mitigation. The requirements for each category are contained in paragraph F, Use Category Requirements, above. All uses not categorized as exempt, allowable, or allowable with mitigation are prohibited and may not occur within the riparian buffer or outside of the riparian buffer with impacts on the buffer unless a variance is obtained pursuant to paragraph 8.5.12, Variances. Uses include construction, monitoring, and maintenance activities.

8.5.10 No Practical Alternatives/Authorization Certificate
A. A person who wishes to undertake a use designated as allowable or allowable with mitigation shall first submit a request for a no practical alternatives determination. Within the Neuse River Basin, the request shall be submitted to the North Carolina Division of Water Resources (Division). Outside of the Neuse River Basin, the request shall be submitted to the City or County as appropriate. In the request, the applicant shall certify that the project meets all of the following criteria:
    1. The basic project purpose cannot be practically accomplished to better minimize disturbance, preserve aquatic life and habitat, and protect water quality;
    2. The use cannot practically be reduced in size or density, reconfigured or redesigned to better minimize disturbance, preserve aquatic life and habitat, and protect water quality; and
    3. Best management practices shall be used if necessary to minimize disturbance, preserve aquatic life and habitat, and protect water quality.
B. The applicant shall also submit at least the following information:
    1. The name, address and phone number of the applicant;
    2. The nature of the activity to be conducted by the applicant;
    3. The location of the activity, including the jurisdiction;
    4. A map of sufficient detail to accurately delineate the boundaries of the land to be utilized in carrying out the activity, the location and dimensions of the riparian buffers, and the location and dimensions of any disturbance in riparian buffers associated with the activity;

    6. Best management practices proposed to control the impacts associated with the activity.
C. Within 60 days of a complete submission, the appropriate jurisdiction (the Division acting pursuant to 15 NCAC 02B .0233 (8)) shall review the entire project and make a finding of fact as to whether the criteria in paragraph 1 above have been met. If they have, no practical alternatives has been established and the jurisdiction shall issue an Authorization Certificate. Failure to act within 60 days shall be construed as a finding of no practical alternatives and an Authorization Certificate shall be issued to the applicant. Outside of the Neuse River Basin, however, such 60-day deadline may be extended if one of the following occurs:
    1. The applicant agrees, in writing, to a longer period;
    2. The jurisdiction determines that the applicant requires an additional reasonable period of time in which to furnish requested information the jurisdiction deems necessary to its decision; or
    3. The final decision is to be made pursuant to a public hearing.
D. The appropriate jurisdiction may attach conditions to an Authorization Certificate that support the purpose, spirit and intent of the state riparian buffer protection program and/or this section.
E. Outside of the Neuse River Basin, the Authorization Certificate shall be denied if the applicant refuses access to its records or premises for the purposes of gathering information the appropriate jurisdiction deems necessary to its decision or if the jurisdiction determines that the applicant has failed to furnish requested information the jurisdiction deems necessary to its decision within the 60-day period or an additional period as authorized under paragraph C.2 above.
F. Despite the provisions of Section 2.4, Board of Adjustment, appeals from Authorization Certificate determinations shall be to the Division Director, c/o the 401 Oversight Express Permitting Unit, or its successor, in writing. The Directors decision is subject to review as provided in Articles 3 and 4 of G.S. 150B.

8.5.11 Mitigation
Mitigation is required where: 1) a person wishes to undertake a use designated as allowable with mitigation and has obtained a no practical alternatives determination; and 2) a person is required to perform mitigation as a condition of variance approval under this section. Within the Neuse River Basin, the proposal shall be submitted to the North Carolina Division of Water Resources (Division), which shall proceed pursuant to 15A NCAC 02B .0242. Outside of the Neuse River Basin, the proposal shall be submitted to the City or County as appropriate, which shall proceed pursuant to this section as authorized under 15A NCAC 02B .0268.
The appropriate jurisdiction (the Division acting pursuant to 15 NCAC 02B .0242) shall issue a mitigation approval upon determining that a proposal meets the requirements of this section. Within the Neuse River Basin, the approval shall specify the required area and location of mitigation. Outside of the Neuse River Basin, the approval shall identify at a minimum the option chosen, the required and proposed areas, and the mitigation location or offset payment amount as applicable. As stated in paragraph 8.5.2, Applicability, compliance with this entire section is required even where State standards are less stringent. Within the Neuse River Basin, final review by the City or County shall occur after any State action is completed.
A. Mitigation Options
The mitigation requirement may be met through one of the following options:
    1. Participation in a private compensatory mitigation bank in the same hydrologic area, as defined in NCGS 143.214(11), as the proposed impact that is approved by the NC Department of Environmental Quality;
    2. Payment of a compensatory mitigation fee to the Riparian Buffer Restoration Fund pursuant to 15A NCAC 02B .0269 contingent upon acceptance of payments by the Division of Mitigation Services. This option is available to a nongovernment applicant only if option 1 is not available;
    3. Donation of real property or of an interest in real property pursuant to paragraph D, Donation of Real Property, below to satisfy a compensatory mitigation fee in whole or in part;
    4. Restoration or enhancement of a non-forested riparian buffer pursuant to paragraph E, Riparian Buffer Restoration or Enhancement, below; or
    5. Construction of an alternative measure that reduces nutrient loading as well as or better than the riparian buffer that is lost in the same river basin as the riparian buffer that is lost and that is approved by the Division.
B. Mitigation Area
The appropriate jurisdiction shall determine the required area of mitigation as follows:
    1. Add the following areas to determine the impacts in square feet to each portion of the riparian buffer:
        a. The area of the footprint of the use causing the impact to the riparian buffer;
        b. The area of the boundary of any clearing and grading activities within the riparian buffer necessary to accommodate the use; and
        c. The area of any ongoing maintenance corridors within the riparian buffer associated with the use; and
    2. Apply the following multipliers to the impacts determined in paragraph 1 to each portion of the riparian buffer:
        a. Impacts to the inner 30 feet of the riparian buffer shall be multiplied by three;
        b. Impacts to the outer 20 feet of the riparian buffer shall be multiplied by one and one-half; and
        c. Impacts to wetlands within those two portions of the riparian buffer that are subject to mitigation under 15A NCAC 2H .0506 shall comply with the mitigation ratios in 15A NCAC 2H .0506.
C. Mitigation Location
    1. Within the Falls Reservoir Watershed, mitigation shall be located within the Upper Falls Watershed, as defined in 15A NCAC 2B.0275 and .0276, and the same distance from, or closer to, the Upper Falls Reservoir, as defined in 15A NCAC 2B.0275 and .0276, as the proposed impact, and as close to the location of the impact as feasible. Alternatively, mitigation may be located anywhere within the Upper Falls Watershed provided that the mitigation proposal accounts for differences in delivery of nutrients to the Upper Falls Watershed resulting from differences between the locations of the buffer impact and mitigation.
    2. Within the Jordan Reservoir Watershed, mitigation shall be located within the same subwatershed, as defined in 15A NCAC 02B.0262, and the same distance from, or closer to, the reservoir as the proposed impact, and as close to the location of the impact as feasible. Alternatively, the applicant may propose mitigation anywhere within the same subwatershed, as defined in 15A NCAC 02B.0262, provided that the mitigation proposal accounts for differences in delivery of nutrients to the affected arm of the reservoir resulting from differences between the locations of the buffer impact and mitigation.
    3. In any location, mitigation of riparian buffer loss in the watershed of a drinking water supply shall be performed in the watershed of that drinking water supply and as may be further limited by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission.
    Additional location requirements for the property donation option are enumerated in paragraph D, Donation of Property, below.
D. Donation of Property
    1. Donation of real property interests that meet the requirements listed below may partially or fully satisfy payment of a compensatory mitigation fee to the Riparian Buffer Restoration Fund, calculated pursuant to 15A NCAC 02B .0269. The value of the property interest shall be determined by an appraisal performed in accordance with paragraph 4 below. The donation shall satisfy the mitigation requirement if the appraised value of the donated property interest is equal to or greater than the required fee. If the appraised value of the donated property interest is less than the required fee, the applicant shall pay the balance.
    2. A conservation easement shall be accepted only if it is granted in perpetuity.

If proof is not presented within this timeframe, the applicant shall be in violation of both the State and local riparian buffer protection programs;
    7. The mitigation area shall be placed under a perpetual conservation easement that provides for protection of the propertys nutrient removal functions;
    8. The applicant shall submit annual reports for a period of five years after the restoration or enhancement showing that the trees planted have survived and that diffuse flow through the riparian buffer has been maintained. The applicant shall replace trees that do not survive and restore diffuse flow if needed during that five-year period.

8.5.12 Variances
A person who wishes to undertake a prohibited use shall first submit a request for a minor or major variance to the appropriate jurisdiction as stated below. A minor variance is required for any activity that impacts only the outer 20 feet of a riparian buffer. A major variance is required for any activity that impacts any portion of the inner 30 feet of a riparian buffer. Such variances are separate from variances authorized under Sec. 3.14, Variance.
A. Within the Neuse River Basin
    1. Minor Variance
    Pursuant to 15 NCAC 02B .0233 (9), a minor variance request shall be submitted to the North Carolina Division of Water Resources (Division) for review and decision. The Division may attach conditions to approval that support the purpose, spirit and intent of the riparian buffer protection program. Appeal from the Division decision shall be to the Office of Administrative Hearings.
    2. Major Variance
    Pursuant to 15 NCAC 02B .0233 (9)(c), a major variance request shall be submitted to the Division for initial review. If the Division determines that the request meets the requirements of paragraph 3, Variance Requirements, below, it shall submit preliminary findings to the NC Environmental Management Commission c/o the Division of Water Resources, 401 Oversight Express Permitting Unit, or its successor. Within 90 days after receipt by the Director of a complete application, the Commission shall approve, approve with conditions or stipulations, or deny the request. Upon and in accordance with the Commissions decision, the Division shall issue a final decision granting, granting subject to conditions or stipulations, or denying the major variance. Appeal from either the initial Division determination or the Commission decision shall be to the Office of Administrative Hearings.
    3. Variance Requirements
    Pursuant to 15 NCAC 02B .0233 (9)(a), the Division shall make a finding of fact as to whether the following requirements have been met:
        a. There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that prevent compliance with the strict letter of the riparian buffer protection requirements; Practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships shall be evaluated in accordance with the following:
            (1) If the applicant complies with the provisions of this section, he/she can secure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, his/her property. Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit from the property shall not be considered adequate justification for a variance. Moreover, the Division shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this section that shall make reasonable use of the property possible;
            (2) The hardship results from application of this section to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship;
            (3) The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicants property, such as its size, shape, or topography, which is different from that of neighboring property;
            (4) The applicant did not cause the hardship by knowingly or unknowingly violating this section;
            (5) The applicant did not purchase the property after the effective date of 15A NCAC 02B .0233, Neuse River Basin: Nutrient Sensitive Waters Management Strategy: Protection and Maintenance of Existing Riparian Buffers, and then requesting an appeal; and
            (6) The hardship is unique to the applicants property, rather than the result of conditions that are widespread. If other properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction, then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others, and would not promote equal justice;
        b. The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this section and preserves its spirit; and
        c. In granting the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured, water quality has been protected, and substantial justice has been done.
B. Outside of the Neuse River Basin
    1. Minor Variance
    A minor variance request shall be submitted to the City or County as appropriate for review and decision. The City or County may attach conditions to approval that support the purpose, spirit and intent of the riparian buffer protection program and this section. Despite the provisions of Section 2.4, Board of Adjustment, appeal from the City or County decision shall be to the Division Director, c/o the 401 Oversight Express Permitting Unit, or its successor. The Directors decision is subject to review as provided in Articles 3 and 4 of G.S. 150B.
    2. Major Variance
    A major variance request shall be submitted to the City or County as appropriate for initial review. If the City or County determines that the request meets the requirements of paragraph 3, Variance Requirements, below, it shall submit preliminary findings to the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission c/o the Division of Water Resources, 401 Oversight Express Permitting Unit, or its successor. Within 90 days after receipt by the City or County of a complete application, the Commission approves, approves with conditions and stipulations, or denies the request. Despite the provisions of Section 2.4, Board of Adjustment, appeal from the initial City or County determination or the Commission decision shall be to Superior Court.
    3. Variance Requirements
    The City or County shall make the following three findings of fact in order to determine that the variance requirements are met:
        a. There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that prevent compliance with the riparian buffer protection requirements. The following criteria must all be met in order to make such finding:
            (1) If the applicant complies with the provisions of this section, he/she can secure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, his/her property. Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit from the property shall not be considered adequate justification for a variance. Moreover, the variance shall be the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this Ordinance that shall make reasonable use of the property possible;
            (2) The hardship results from application of this section to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship;
            (3) The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicants property, such as its size, shape, or topography, such that compliance with provisions of this section would not allow reasonable use of the property;
            (4) The applicant did not cause the hardship by knowingly or unknowingly violating this Ordinance;
            (5) The applicant did not purchase the property after the effective date of this Ordinance, and then request a variance; and
            (6) The hardship is rare or unique to the applicants property.
        b. The requested variance is in harmony with the general purpose, spirit and intent of the state riparian buffer protection requirements and/or this section; and
        c. In granting the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured, water quality has been protected, and substantial justice has been done.

B. Tree Grates
Tree grates for required trees shall not be permitted in the Rural Tier. When used, such grates shall be sized and maintained to ensure continued health of any required tree and installed so as not to create any pedestrian hazard.
C. Groundcovers and Mulch
    1. Groundcovers can be planted around trees, provided they are located outside of the planting hole.
    2. Mulch shall be used in all areas where no other ground cover or grass is used to avoid bare spots.
D. Certification
The Planning Director, or designee, may authorize licensed landscape architects to certify that landscape plantings have been installed in conformance with the approved landscaping plan including planting sizes, species, and installation techniques in lieu of inspection by the Planning Department.

Sec. 9.3 Existing Vegetation Credits for Required Landscaping

Paragraphs:
9.3.1        Existing Vegetation
9.3.2        Existing Trees
9.3.3        Sampling

9.3.1 Existing Vegetation
A. Healthy vegetation that is retained can be credited toward landscaping requirements.
B. Vegetation to be saved shall meet all requirements of paragraph 8.3.2, Protection of Existing Vegetation.

9.3.2 Existing Trees
A. Healthy canopy trees can be retained and credited toward landscaping requirements if each tree proposed for credit has a dbh of at least one inch, or larger if specified elsewhere in this ordinance, and all requirements of paragraph 8.3.2, Protection of Existing Vegetation, are satisfied. Credit given for existing, healthy, protected trees shall be a number equal to the value of the dbh of each protected tree divided by two inches, but no fraction thereof.
B. Credit shall be allocated on a one-for-one basis for healthy evergreen trees, deciduous understory trees, evergreen understory trees or shrubs. The size of material shall not be taken into account, except where such material is below the required minimum planting size, in which case no credit shall be granted.
C. In order to receive credit for any retained trees, at least 75% of the root protection zone shall remain undisturbed. Root zones extending into rights-of-way shall be considered disturbed areas, unless legally binding protections are placed upon those areas. Trees whose root protection zones fall outside the protected area, but are within larger groups of trees, shall not count toward any landscaping requirements but shall be left in place unless they are diseased or otherwise hazardous to the integrity of the buffer or the development.
D. Existing trees located within 30 feet of power lines or within utility easements shall not be eligible to receive credit, unless the tree is a species appropriate for underneath power lines or received approval to be located within the utility easement.

9.3.3 Sampling
A. All trees, shrubs and groundcover within a minimum 20-by-20-foot area for each unique stand of vegetation proposed to be retained shall be inventoried and identified on the landscape plan.
    1. Photographs can be used to supplement the sample but shall not replace it.
    2. For purposes of determining preserved tree coverage, shrubs and groundcover need not be included in the sampling.
B. The Planning Director, or designee, can require additional sample areas as needed to ensure a representative sample of the existing vegetation.

How to Use this Table: The second number represents the Total Buffer, which normally occurs across the property line, with unequal responsibility for buffering on both sides of the line based on intensity of the use or district. Therefore:
    1. The first number indicates the required opacity when adjacent to undeveloped land.
    2. The second number is the opacity required when adjacent to a development without a buffer.
    3. If a buffer exists on adjacent property, the required opacity on the property to be developed shall be the difference between the opacity on the adjacent property from the total, or second, opacity number.
    4. A zero means no project boundary buffer is required.
    Example: A new development in the CG District abutting a developed RS District without a buffer would be required to provide a buffer with a total opacity of .8 (80% opaque). If the adjacent RS property were undeveloped, the requirement would be reduced to .6 (60% opaque), and the developer of the RS property would provide the remaining .2 (20%) at the time of development of the residential property.
C. Modifications of the Project Boundary Buffer Table
    1. Multiplex and apartment development proposed in any district to be adjacent to single-family districts or single-family developments on other properties shall provide buffers in accordance with the provisions for RS-M or RU-M districts.
    2. Nonresidential development proposed in a residential district to be adjacent to residential districts or residential developments (except for upper story residential or with any intervening street or railroad right-of-way) on other properties, that would not otherwise require a buffer, shall provide buffers in accordance with the provisions of the CN District in determining buffer requirements. Principal uses listed in paragraph 5.2.4F, Parks and Open Areas, except playgrounds and zoos, are exempt from this requirement.
    3. Nonresidential uses proposed next to property used for residential purposes, although nonresidentially zoned, shall provide a buffer along the side of the property adjoining the property used residentially equivalent to one-half of the buffer width that would have been required for property with a residential zoning designation within that Tier.
    4. The buffer requirement for a subject property zoned Industrial Light (IL) adjacent to property zoned Industrial (I), per the table in paragraph 9.4.3B, shall be 0.2/0.4 when the subject property is four acres or less in size.
    5. Some uses may require additional buffering, as set forth in the specific use standards of Sec. 5.3, Limited Use Standards.
    6. For residential development utilizing mass grading in the Suburban Tier, a minimum opacity of 0.4 shall be required, unless a greater opacity is otherwise required.
D. Major Specimen Trees Protected
Existing major specimen trees located within a required project boundary buffer shall be surveyed and protected as described in paragraphs 8.3.5 and 9.3.2, Existing Trees. Removal of such trees is allowed only as required to provide access to the property.

9.4.4 Natural Buffers
A. Natural Buffer Required
    1. Existing healthy, natural forest cover and other vegetation shall be used to meet buffer requirements in the Rural and Suburban Tiers in the following instance:
        a. Where a buffer with an opacity of 0.6 or greater is required;
        b. Where the existing tree cover exceeds 15 feet in height; and
        c. Where the existing tree canopy covers at least 25% of the required buffer area.
    2. The minimum width of a required natural buffer shall be 30 feet.
B. Natural Buffer as an Option
In the Urban Tier and in projects in the Rural and Suburban Tiers that do not require use of a natural buffer, a natural buffer can be employed. A minimum natural buffer width of 20 feet or the width required to satisfy paragraph 9.4.5, Constructed Buffer, whichever is greater, shall be required in these instances.
C. Tree Protection in Natural Buffers
In addition to the requirements of paragraph 8.3.2, Protection of Existing Vegetation, trees within natural buffers shall be protected as follows:
    1. For the trees with a dbh of 30 inches or less, 75% of the root protection zone shall be undisturbed; and
    2. For trees over 30 inches dbh, at least 90% of the root protection zone shall be undisturbed.
D. Additional Planting
If a natural buffer does not meet the opacity standards required by paragraph 9.4.3B, Project Boundary Buffer Table, then additional plant material based upon the applicable planting table in paragraph 9.4.5, Constructed Buffer, shall be provided to meet those standards. Sampling of existing vegetation within a natural buffer pursuant to paragraph 9.3.3, Sampling, shall be required to determine if it meets this standard.

9.4.5 Constructed Buffer
A. Plant Units
The plant units listed below shall be considered comparable, and therefore interchangeable, as set forth below.
    1. The following plant unit alternatives shall be used, unless otherwise specified in this Article, to satisfy the project boundary buffer requirements:
        a. Alternative 1: Mixed Evergreen
        b. Alternative 2: Deciduous
        c. Alternative 3: Evergreen
        d. Alternative 4: Overhead Utility
        e. Alternative 5: Intense
    2. Alternative 2, Deciduous, shall not be permitted adjacent to residential districts or uses unless employed with a wall pursuant to paragraph 9.4.8, Walls, Berms and Fences in Buffers.
    3. Alternative 4, Overhead Utility, shall be permitted only where overhead utilities would conflict with the drip-line of canopy trees.
    4. All shrubs used to meet plant unit requirements shall be upright shrubs.
B. Rural and Suburban Tier
    1. The buffer width and planting requirements in the table below shall be used to meet the opacity standards established in paragraph 9.4.3, Standards. Use of the interactive buffer model established pursuant to paragraph 9.4.7, Interactive Buffer Model, shall not be permitted, except where the slope of the buffer is at least 15%, in which case the requirements of paragraph 9.4.5D, Existing Slope Impacts, shall be applied.

    2. When proposed residential units adjoin an active agricultural use, the minimum buffer width shall be 50 feet, with a minimum opacity of 0.2.
    3. Buffer widths can be reduced by up to 25% through the incorporation of a wall or berm pursuant to paragraph 9.4.8, Walls, Berms and Fences in Buffers. Application of this reduction in width shall provide a corresponding reduction in the number of required shrubs.
C. Urban, Compact Neighborhood, and Downtown Tiers
    1. The buffer width and planting requirements in the table below shall be used to meet the opacity standards established in paragraph 9.4.3, Standards, for the Urban Tier and those areas of the Downtown and Compact Neighborhood Tiers that adjoin development in the Urban or Suburban Tiers and the opacity standards established in paragraph 9.4.1C for Design districts.

1Use of the Intense Buffer will permit reduction of buffer width up to 25%.
2A solid hedge composed of a minimum of 40 evergreen understory trees per 100 linear feet can be substituted for a 6-foot wall.
    2. The interactive buffer model established pursuant to paragraph 9.4.7, Interactive Buffer Model, shall be permitted to calculate acceptable reductions in buffer width or variable mixes of plant units. The model can also be used when the slope of the buffer is at least 15%, as set forth in paragraph 9.4.5D, Existing Slope Impacts.
    3. For projects within the CI District and Design Districts, an alternative to project boundary buffers shall be permitted with the following provisions:
        a. A solid hedge composed of a minimum of 40 evergreen understory trees per 100 linear feet, with a minimum height of six feet at time of planting; or
        b. A wall pursuant to paragraph 9.4.8, Walls, Berms and Fences in Buffers, is provided so long as any wall that is a structural part of a building may only be used if there is no glazing in the wall.
D. Existing Slope Impacts
Existing slopes shall be considered those that are naturally occurring and not created through the grading of the site.
Commentary: Proposed projects may require more than one type of buffer. For example, a project site might include a modest slope along the southern property line (requiring a flat land buffer) and a 20% hill on the northern property line (requiring an Upslope Buffer).
    1. Buffers with at Least 15% Slope
        a. General
            (1) Buffer design changes depending on the degree of slope and whether the property being developed is up or down slope from the property being protected.
            (2) On slopes of at least 15% but less than 25%, for each 100 feet of buffer section length, an upslope or downslope buffer shall be required.
            (3) On slopes of least 25% for each 100 feet of buffer section length, a steep slope buffer shall be required.
            (4) Sloped buffer areas less than 100 feet in length, as measured parallel to the property line, and with less than five feet of difference in elevation between the project site and the adjacent property shall be considered flat lands and be exempt from providing slope buffers.
        b. Downslope Buffer
        [IMAGE: <9.4.1_001.png>]
            (1) Where the area containing the buffer slopes down from the adjacent property line toward the interior of the project at a slope of at least 15% but less than 25%, the buffer may be less effective because roof areas may be exposed (the adjacent property looks down onto the proposed site). In such cases, a steep slope buffer retaining the forest cover, or a standard project boundary buffer can be used buffer.
            (2) If a constructed buffer is to be provided, 60% of the buffer width (starting at the property line) shall be graded to a slope of less than 15% with the adjacent land. The fill shall return to grade at a slope not to exceed 1:3 (33%). This may require a wider buffer to accommodate the fill. The interactive buffer model established pursuant to paragraph 9.4.7, Interactive Buffer Model, shall be used to determine whether the buffer achieves the required opacity.
        c. Upslope Buffers
        [IMAGE: <9.4.1_002.png>]
            (1) Where the area containing the buffer slopes up from the adjacent property line toward the interior of the project site at a slope of at least 15% but less than 25%, the buffer may be more effective due to the masking potential of the slope. In such cases, a standard project boundary buffer, a steep slope buffer, or the interactive buffer model established pursuant to paragraph 9.4.7, Interactive Buffer Model can be utilized.
    2. Steep Slope Buffer (Slope at least 25%)
        a. Tree Covered Slopes
        If a buffer area has a slope of at least 25% and tree coverage meeting the standards of paragraph 8.3.1D, Preserved Tree Coverage, exists on the site, the slope area shall be assumed to meet the requirements of a natural buffer with no healthy trees or shrubs removed and no grading or clearing permitted.
        b. Slopes with Minimal Tree Coverage
        If a buffer area has a slope of at least 25% but lacks the tree cover as specified above, then tree replacement pursuant to paragraph 8.3.1E, Replacement Tree Coverage, shall be required, except that:
            (1) No trees greater than two inches caliper shall be planted; and
            (2) A minimum of ten understory trees shall be provided per acre.
E. Buffer Width Modification
 Buffer width shall normally be calculated as perpendicular to the property line, however, width modifications are allowed and shall be calculated based on the average width of the buffer per 100 feet or portion thereof.
    1. In no case shall the minimum width of the buffer be less than one-half the required width.
    2. The maximum width, for the purposes of installing required landscaping or receiving credit for existing vegetation, shall not be more than one and one-half times the required buffer width.

9.4.6 Off-Site Vegetation
A. Existing plant material on adjacent property can be credited toward buffer requirements, provided that such material is in a permanently protected area such as a conservation easement or similarly preserved area.
B. Plant material, either existing or proposed, on an adjacent property can be credited toward buffer requirements through use of a landscape easement.

9.4.7 Interactive Buffer Model
A. Alternative Buffers Permitted
To allow flexibility in buffer design, the interactive buffer model, maintained by the Planning Director or designee, can be used to create a buffer meeting or exceeding the opacity standards using a variety of widths, plant material, walls or berms under the following circumstances:
    1. In the Downtown, Compact Neighborhood, and Urban Tiers, the interactive buffer model can be used; however, no alternative buffer shall be permitted to be less than one-half the minimum width shown in the tables in paragraph 9.4.5C, Urban, Compact Neighborhood, and Downtown Tiers, above.
    2. In the Rural and Suburban Tiers, the interactive buffer model shall not be used, except where the slope of the buffer exceeds 15%. Buffer width shall not be reduced through use of the model.
B. Settings of the Model
Settings for the interactive buffer model are maintained at the offices of the Planning Department. Model settings can be obtained upon request at the Planning Department during normal business hours.

9.4.8 Walls, Berms and Fences in Buffers
Where walls, berms or fences are built within any required project boundary buffer, they shall meet the following requirements:
A. Walls
    1. Walls located within a buffer can be used to permit a reduction the buffer width pursuant to paragraph 9.4.5, Constructed Buffer.
    2. All walls, when located within a buffer, shall have planted on the side facing the adjacent property with at least one upright shrub for every six feet of wall length. These shrubs can be counted towards meeting the opacity requirement for the buffer.
    3. Where shrubs are planted adjacent to a wall, the minimum distance between the wall and the property line shall be four feet.
    4. The applicant shall be required to demonstrate provision for access and maintenance of landscaping and the wall structure at the time of landscape plan approval.
    5. Walls used within the CI District in lieu of a required buffer width shall be permitted, with the following provisions:
        a. The wall shall have a height of eight feet; and
        b. The wall is not within sight distance triangle(s).
    6. Within the CI District and Design Districts, no project boundary buffer shall be required when the adjoining lot has a wall included as part of a required buffer, the wall is located within five feet of the property line, and a recorded easement exists for the wall and buffer.
    7. Walls used within Design Districts in lieu of a required buffer width shall be permitted, with the following provisions:
        a. The wall shall have a minimum height of six feet;
        b. A minimum of one upright, evergreen shrub shall be installed per four linear feet along the side of the wall facing off-site; and
        c. The wall is not within sight distance triangle(s).
    8. Walls shall comply with the height requirements pursuant to Sec. 9.9, Fences and Walls, except that walls located outside of areas that qualify as street frontage shall be a minimum height of six feet.
B. Berms
    1. Berms located within a buffer can be used to permit a reduction in buffer width in the Suburban and Rural Tiers.
    2. The minimum height shall be four feet.
    3. Berms shall have side slopes of not less than three feet horizontal for each one foot vertical and a minimum crown width of two feet. Prior to issuance of the first certificate of compliance, berms shall be planted to ensure coverage by live plant material within five years.
C. Fences
    1. No reduction in buffer width shall be provided based on the provision of a fence.
    2. Fences shall be maintained in a structurally safe and attractive condition and with finished faces and plantings located towards the adjacent property with at least one upright shrub for every six linear feet of fence length.

9.4.9 Separate Parcels for Stormwater Management
Where a separate legal parcel is permitted for stormwater management, buffers consistent with those required for the remainder of the project shall be required, except that if the stormwater parcel adjoins a street or railroad right-of-way 50 feet or less in width, a buffer with a minimum opacity of 0.2 shall be required and planted in accordance with the Public Works Departments Reference Guide for Development.

9.4.10 Permitted Activity Within Project Boundary Buffers
A. Vehicular and pedestrian passageways such as driveways, railroad right-of-way, and bicycle and pedestrian paths, and utilities can cross a project boundary buffer, provided they cross at a maximum of 15 degrees from perpendicular.
B. Stormwater management facilities can be located in a buffer provided that an upland area that meets or exceeds the opacity requirements of paragraph 9.4.3, Standards, is provided.

Sec. 9.5 Mass Grading Buffers and Revegetation

Paragraphs:
9.5.1        Mass Grading Buffers
9.5.2        Exemption
9.5.3        Revegetation

9.5.1 Mass Grading Buffers
A. Applicability
    1. Mass grading buffers shall only apply to activity within the City jurisdiction.
    2. Mass grading, as defined in Sec. 17.3, in the Rural, Suburban, Urban, and Compact Neighborhood Tiers where no other site improvements are proposed shall require perimeter mass grading buffers at all exterior lot lines pursuant to this section.
    3. Buffers required by this section shall no longer be required upon approval of a site plan for other site improvements, although buffers may be required by other provisions of this article. If such a site plan or a final plat is approved, the required mass grading buffer shall be retained until a project boundary buffer pursuant to Sec. 9.4, Project Boundary Buffers, is installed. A preliminary plat does not relieve the applicant of the requirements of this paragraph.
    4. A site plan for buildings, not just utilities, must be approved to be relieved of the requirements of this section.
B. Buffer Standards
    1. General
    No grading shall be allowed within mass grading buffers except to provide reasonable access and for utility installation. All crossings and intrusions into the mass grading buffer shall be at an angle between 75 and 105 degrees, with minimal disturbance to the buffer.
    2. Adjoining Other Properties
        a. Perimeter mass grading buffers adjoining other properties (along exterior property lines), shall be a minimum of 65 feet in width if the adjoining property is developed, or 32 feet if the adjoining property is undeveloped, measured perpendicular to the boundary of the site, and shall be in place prior to such grading activity.

Sec. 9.11 Extensions

Paragraphs:
9.11.1       General Request for Extension of Compliance
9.11.2       Extensions for All Other Development

9.11.1 General Request for Extension of Compliance
It is recognized that land development occurs continuously and that vegetation used in landscaping or screening should be planted at certain times to ensure the best chance of survival.

9.11.2 Extensions for All Other Development
A. In order to ensure compliance and to reduce the potential expense of replacing landscaping or screening materials which were installed at an inappropriate time or under unfavorable conditions, a letter of request for extension of compliance with landscaping requirements can be filed with the Planning Director, or designee, which states the reasons why the request is being made. This letter shall acknowledge that the applicant is aware of all landscaping and screening requirements, and will comply with those requirements within 90 days, or discontinue use of the property.
B. The Planning Director, or designee, shall grant the extension on requests for planting extensions for single-family development submitted between May 15 and September 15 of each year and may grant the extensions for other uses and at other times if there are unfavorable conditions for planting.
C. If the initial letter of request for extension of compliance with landscaping requirements has expired and conditions are still deemed unsuitable for planting, an applicant can request one additional extension of up to 90 days. During periods of extreme drought, as evidenced by the official declaration of Stage 3 or greater mandatory water conservation requirements, the Planning Director, or designee, may authorize additional 90-day extensions beyond the one extension typically allowed. These extensions may be continued throughout the period in which the extreme drought conditions remain.
D. The applicant shall also acknowledge that while a Conditional Certificate of Compliance may be issued, no Final Certificate of Compliance shall be issued while there is an active (pending) letter of request for extension of compliance with landscaping requirements unless a performance guarantee (such as a letter of credit or performance bond) sufficient to cover 125% of the installed landscaping costs has been posted with the Inspections or Planning Department.

            (1) Pervious paving shall be considered surface improvements such as interlocking concrete paving blocks, brick pavers, grid pavers, or other similar improvements which permit the infiltration of water through the improved surface.
            (2) Sub-surface preparation to accommodate the water infiltration allowed through the surface material shall be required.
            (3) Gravel shall not be considered a pervious paving surface.
        b. The additional parking spaces shall be provided as structured parking subject to the following requirements:
            (1) The footprint of proposed structured parking cannot exceed 75% of the footprint of a surface parking lot designed to accommodate 100% parking; and
            (2) The maximum height shall be the height permitted within the zoning district.
        c. The additional parking spaces are underground where parking areas are not visible from the right-of-way or adjacent properties.
        d. For all sites except in Design Districts: a sealed alternative parking rate analysis, prepared by an engineer with expertise in transportation, that utilizes the following criteria to substantiate the need for additional parking. The City Transportation Director or designee, or NCDOT, as applicable, shall be the approving authority for the analysis.
            (1) Data or studies of similar sites and uses;
            (2) Comparisons to minimum standards in national published data sources such as Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), Urban Land Institute (ULI), National Parking Association (NPA), American Planning Association (APA), or other professionally recognized data sources; and

        a. Shared Parking
            (1) Proposed developments or change of use with two or more uses can reduce the total minimum parking requirements by a maximum of 20% if the following factors are demonstrated through a parking generation analysis, prepared and sealed by a registered engineer with transportation expertise, documenting the following:
                (a) The peak hours for each use do not overlap; and
                (b) The proposed amount of parking is sufficient to accommodate the anticipated demands for each of the uses at peak hour.
            (2) Bicycle parking can be reduced by the same percentage if the amount of bicycle parking provided would accommodate each use individually.
        b. Additional Bicycle Parking and Public Transit
        A maximum 5% reduction is permitted if either of the following is met, and a maximum of 10% if both are met:
            (1) Proposed development sites or change of use sites where public transit stops exist or will be provided at a location approved by the transit provider as part of the site plan submittal.

    1. Minimum Total Required
    This amount indicates the gross minimum number of bicycle parking spaces required.
    2. Short-term parking
        a. This amount, if required, shall be the minimum amount of the minimum total required parking that shall be dedicated to short-term parking.
        b. Short-term parking shall be publicly accessible parking located outdoors at primary entrances of buildings or within parking structures.
    3. Long-term parking
        a. This amount, if required, shall be the minimum amount of the minimum total required parking that shall be dedicated to long-term parking.
        b. Long-term parking is not required to be publicly accessible or located outdoors.
        c. Long-term parking shall not be placed within individual dwelling units.
        d. If placed outdoors, the parking facility shall be lit in accordance with storage areas (security lighting) pursuant to paragraph 7.4.3, Standards; covered to provide protection from rain and snow; and, if provided for residential uses, be located within a secured enclosure.
    4. Remaining Required Parking
    Remaining required parking not required to be short- or long-term parking can be provided as either type of parking at the discretion of the applicant.
    Example: The minimum total required bicycle parking spaces for a 100-dwelling unit development is 50 spaces. Of the 50 spaces:
    1Six short-term spaces are required (because 5% of 50 is less than six); and
    2Thirty-eight long-term spaces are required (75% of 50 is 37.5 spaces, which requires rounding up to 38).
    3The remaining spaces can be short- or long-term parking.
    5. Small Projects
    Projects that do not generate enough required bicycle parking to satisfy short and/or long term parking minimum requirements, as applicable, shall provide the minimum overall requirement as either type at the discretion of the applicant.

Sec. 11.2 General Requirements for Signs

Paragraphs:
11.2.1       Sign Defined Interpretations
11.2.2       Sign Calculation Standards
11.2.3       Substitution of Noncommercial Message
11.2.4       Illumination

11.2.6       Placement of Signs
11.2.7       Changeable Copy on On-Premise Signs
11.2.8       Nonconforming Signs

11.2.1 Sign Defined Interpretations
A. A sign shall be considered any words, lettering, parts of letters, figures, numerals, phrases, sentences, emblems, devices, structures, designs, trade names, or trade marks by which anything is made known such as are used to designate an individual, a firm, an association, a corporation, a profession, a business, or a commodity or products, which are legible from any public street or adjacent property and used to attract attention.
B. This definition includes the structure or the face on which a sign message is displayed.
C. For the purposes of this section, this definition shall not include "trade dress," i.e.; architectural features identified with a product or business, as a sign.
D. Various kinds of signs are further defined in this section.
E. (County Only) Signs within the SRP-C District shall be regulated pursuant to this Article if legible from property not zoned SRP-C, instead of adjacent property as indicated in paragraph A, above.

11.2.2 Sign Calculation Standards
A. Sign Area
    1. The area of a sign shall include all lettering, wording, designs and symbols, together with the background, whether open or enclosed, on which they are displayed. The supporting structure or bracing of a sign shall be omitted in measuring the area of the sign unless such structure or bracing is made part of the message or face of the sign. Any backlit area shall be considered part of the face of the sign.
    Commentary: The golden arches at McDonalds, if used as support for a sign, are clearly integral to the sign message and would be included in the computation of the area of the sign face.
    [IMAGE: <11.2.2_001.png>]
    2. Where a sign consists of individual letters, words or symbols attached to a surface, building, canopy, awning, wall or window and all such elements are located in the same plane, the sign area shall be the area of the smallest rectangle which completely encompasses all such letters, words or symbols and any accompanying background of a color different than the natural color of the wall. Where such sign includes multiple words, each word located in the same plane shall be computed separately.
    [IMAGE: <11.2.2_002.png>]
    Commentary: Channel letter signs, mounted logos, and similar devices are treated differently than signs in cabinets  the wall area between multiple elements does not count as sign area.
    3. The area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces. On all signs other than wall signs, which shall only be allowed one face, signs with identical sign faces placed in such a manner to ensure that the angle at which the two sign faces are placed does not exceed 60 degrees, shall be considered as a single face.
    [IMAGE: <11.2.2_003.png>]
    Commentary: It is presumed that where sign faces are placed less than 60 degrees apart, both faces are not readable from any one point.
    4. The entire surface area of a multi-tenant sign that depicts the names of the individual tenants shall count toward the total aggregate area of the sign.
    5. All monument signs shall incorporate a street address number or address range. Street address numbers shall be a minimum of six inches high in residential districts, and 12 inches high in all other districts. The area of the address number shall not be computed as part of the sign face unless it exceeds twice the minimum number height requirement. All such street address numbers shall be displayed in accordance with City or County standards, as applicable.
B. Aggregate Sign Area
    1. The maximum allowable aggregate sign area of all signs in a project that may be allocated among all sign types allowed or permitted on the site shall be as follows:
        a. Buildings within the DD District and Compact Neighborhood Tiers shall be permitted a sign area equal to 25% of the wall area below 26 feet in height plus 10% of the wall area above 26 feet in height, except where this Ordinance allows signs in the DD District with no maximum size. (County Only) This standard shall also apply to the SRP-C District.
        b. Buildings within nonresidential zoning districts except those listed in paragraphs c or d below shall be permitted two square feet of sign area for each linear foot of lot frontage.
        c. Buildings in the OI District and the -TO Overlay shall be permitted one square foot of sign area for each linear foot of lot frontage.
        d. Buildings in the SRP, IL, and I districts shall be permitted two and one quarter square feet of sign area for each linear foot of lot frontage.
        e. In order to accommodate projects with very small frontages at least 32 square feet of sign area shall be permitted as a minimum in all nonresidential districts.
    2. Application of the aggregate sign area allowable shall not permit the area of any single sign or sign type to exceed the standard established elsewhere in this Article.
C. Sign Height
[IMAGE: <11.2.2_004.png>]
The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at a computed grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign (including the sign face, sign structure, or any other appurtenance). The computed grade shall be the elevation of the nearest point to the proposed sign location of the crown of the nearest public street providing access; or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot, whichever is higher.

11.2.3 Substitution of Noncommercial Message
Noncommercial signs shall be allowed in all districts and may be substituted for any sign expressly allowed under this Ordinance. Noncommercial signs shall be subject to the same permit requirements, restrictions on size and type, and other conditions and specifications as apply to the sign for which they are being substituted.

11.2.4 Illumination
A. Signs may be illuminated from within or from an external source, but such illumination shall be in a manner which avoids glare or reflection which in any way interferes with traffic safety.
B. Internally illuminated signs shall be required to have an opaque background and translucent copy.
C. Sign lighting shall not be detrimental to adjacent residential property. Property directly across a public right of way, other than a controlled access highway, shall be considered to be adjacent property.
D. Unless otherwise permitted within this Ordinance, signs shall not be illuminated by moving lights, flickering lights, or a string of lights placed around the sign.

11.2.5 Design, Construction and Maintenance
A. All signs shall comply with applicable provisions of the North Carolina Building Code and the National Electrical Code.
B. Signs shall be constructed of permanent materials and permanently affixed to the ground or building except for those signs that, by their nature, are considered temporary:
C. Permanent signs shall be maintained in good condition at all times and shall be kept free of cracked or peeling paint, missing or damaged sign panels or supports, and weeds, grass or vegetation that obscures the view of the sign message.

11.2.6 Placement of Signs
A. Signs shall be located so as not to block windows, doors, or other means of ingress and egress.
B. Unless otherwise allowed in this Ordinance, no commercial messages shall be allowed on construction fencing.

11.2.7 Changeable Copy on On-Premise Signs
Except as authorized under paragraph 11.3.1B, Exception for Downtown Tier, changeable copy shall be allowed only on on-premise signs that are: in nonresidential districts, associated with nonresidential uses in the PDR District, or associated with places of worship and institutional uses in any district, subject to the following:
A. No more than 50% of the area of a sign shall be devoted to changeable copy, except for signs for theaters which can devote up to 80% of a sign to changeable copy.
B. The display of copy shall not change more than eight times in one day, except for time and temperature displays.
C. Displayed copy shall not be animated, blinking, chasing, flashing, or have other moving effects. This provision shall not restrict the copy from changing from one message to another.

11.2.8 Nonconforming Signs
A. Signs that were lawful as of the effective date of this Ordinance but are not in conformance with current requirements shall be permitted to be maintained as nonconforming signs.
B. Nonconforming Off-Premise Signs
Certain off-premise signs, as defined in Sec. 11.3, Prohibited Signs, that were made nonconforming by previous ordinances but were allowed to continue beyond the amortization period in force for other off-premise signs may continue to exist until such point that compensation is not required for their removal under federal law, subject to the following restrictions, which are carried forward from previous ordinances, or are clarifications of such ordinances:
    1. The signs and supporting structures may not be enlarged, moved to a different location in the City or County except by moving 1/100th of a mile on the same sign location or site as authorized by 19A NCAC 2E.0210(16), or improved through replacement by substantially different materials or in any other manner;
    2. Lights and/or other electric or electronic features may not be added, and the intensity of lighting may not be increased;
    3. The signs must operate in compliance with all other restrictions in Article 11, and the UDO, and other local regulations, including but not limited to prohibitions on sign operation and sign features contained in paragraph 11.3.1 and 11.3.2 and prohibitions on dilapidated and damaged signs contained in 11.3.6 and 11.3.7.
    4. The signs shall be removed if repair or damage to the sign and structure exceeds 50% of value as determined by the criteria in 19A NCAC 2E.0225(f);
    5. The signs shall operate in compliance with all restrictions contained in federal and/or State law and regulation; and
    6. The owner of such signs shall maintain all necessary records and documents, including permits, required to be obtained under previous ordinances and/or State law or regulation, to demonstrate that the sign may continue to exist under the provisions of paragraph 11.3.5.
    The restrictions contained in this section, 11.2.8B shall not be interpreted to prohibit the City or County from requiring removal of any nonconforming off-premise sign when removal is accomplished in accordance with applicable law, including but not limited to federal and/or state requirements regarding compensation.

        b. In order for a land-disturbing activity to be eligible for an agricultural exemption (no exemption is to be assumed until approval of the request by the County), it must be reasonably demonstrated to the County that the land on which the disturbance is taking place is intended for continuous agricultural use. To qualify for exemption under this section, an application for exemption shall be submitted to the County Sedimentation and Erosion Control Office. The Erosion Control Officer or designee shall review the application and grant or deny the exemption within 15 working days of receipt. The land owner shall receive notification of this decision in writing and have 10 working days to respond if the exemption is denied. The County Engineer or designee shall have five working days to review and decide on the appeal. Appeal of the County Engineers or designees decision may be made to the Board of Commissioners within 30 days of receipt.
        The County may require preparation and approval of an erosion and sedimentation control plan for land-disturbing activities applying for an application for exemption where sediment control measures are needed to protect against off-site damages due to sediment from the land-disturbing activity as documented by the County staff.
    4. Land-disturbing activities undertaken on forest land for the production and harvesting of timber and timber products and which are conducted in accordance with best management practices set out in Forest Practice Guidelines Related to Water Quality, as adopted by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. If land-disturbing activity undertaken on forestland for the production and harvesting of timber and timber products is not conducted in accordance with Forest Practice Guidelines Related to Water Quality, the provisions of this Article shall apply to such activity and any related land-disturbing activity;
    5. Land-disturbing activities undertaken by persons as defined in NCGS § 113A-52(8) who are otherwise regulated by the provisions of the Mining Act of 1971, NCGS § 74-46  74-68;
    6. Land-disturbing activities over which the state has exclusive regulatory jurisdiction as provided in NCGS § 113A-56(a);
    7. Land-disturbing activities undertaken for the duration of an emergency, activities essential to protect human life;
    8. Activities undertaken to restore the wetland functions of converted wetlands to provide compensatory mitigation to offset impacts permitted under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act; and
    9. Activities undertaken pursuant to Natural Resources Conservation Service standards to restore the wetlands functions of converted wetlands as defined in Title 7 Code of Federal Regulations Sec. 12.2 (January 1, 2014 Edition).
B. Plan Required
Subject to the exemptions listed in subsection 12.10.2, a sedimentation and erosion control plan shall be required for any land-disturbing activity within the County, including the City, if more than 20,000 aggregate square feet will be disturbed, or if 12,000 or more aggregate square feet will be disturbed in a M/LR-A, M/LR-B, F/J-A, or E-A watershed protection overlay district. The Sedimentation and Erosion Control Officer or designee may also require a plan for any land-disturbing activity if it determines that off-site damage is occurring or the potential for off-site damage exists. A plan may also be required when the applicant, or a parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of the applicant, has engaged in any activity listed in paragraph 3.8.7, Disapproval of Plan.

*R  Required in a Lake Michie/Little River Critical Area (M/LR-A), Lake Michie/Little River Protected Area (M/LR-B), Falls/Jordan Critical Area (F/J-A) and Eno River Critical Area (E-A).
C. Protection of Property
Persons conducting land-disturbing activity shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and private property from damage caused by such activity.
D. More Restrictive Rules Shall Apply
Whenever conflicts exist between federal, State or local laws, ordinances or rules, the more restrictive provision shall apply.

12.10.3 Basic Control Objectives
In order for a sedimentation and erosion control plan to be approved, the following control objectives shall be met:
A. Identify Critical Areas
On-site areas which are subject to severe erosion, and off-site areas which are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special attention;
B. Limit Time of Exposure
All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time;
C. Limit Exposed Areas
All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time;
D. Control Surface Water
Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas shall be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of exposure;
E. Control Sedimentation
All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted so as to restrain off-site sedimentation damage; and
F. Manage Stormwater Runoff
When the increase in the velocity of stormwater runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans are to include measures to control the velocity at the point of discharge so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and increased sedimentation of the stream.

12.10.4 Mandatory Standards for Land-Disturbing Activity
No land-disturbing activity shall occur except in accordance with the mandatory standards listed below. Except where more stringent standards are specified in this Ordinance, the technical standards and specifications contained in the North Carolina Erosion and Sediment Control Planning and Design Manual shall also apply. In addition, for land-disturbing activities greater than or equal to one acre, requirements within the most recent version of the State of North Carolina General Permit No. NCG010000 shall apply.
A. Buffer Zones
Except where more stringent buffer requirements are specified in Article 8, Environmental Protection, and/or Article 9, Landscaping and Buffering, the following requirements shall apply;
    1. No land-disturbing activity during periods of construction or improvement to land shall be permitted in proximity to a lake or natural watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided along the margin of the watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the 25% of the buffer zone nearest the land-disturbing activity. This subsection shall not apply to a land-disturbing activity in connection with the construction of facilities to be located on, over or under a lake or natural watercourse; and
    2. Unless otherwise provided, the width of a buffer zone is measured from the top of the bank nearest edge of the disturbed area, with the 25% of the strip nearer the land-disturbing activity containing natural or artificial means of confining visible siltation.
B. Stabilization of Disturbed Land
The angle for disturbed land shall be no greater than the angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or other adequate erosion control devices or structures.
    1. Ongoing Activity
        a. Ground Cover
        Land left exposed shall be planted or otherwise provided with temporary ground cover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion within the applicable time period after completion of any phase of grading or period of inactivity as follows: seven days for a steep slope; 10 days for a moderate slope; 14 days for land with no slope or inclination. For purposes of this section, a moderate slope means an inclined area, the inclination of which is less than or equal to three units of horizontal distance to one unit of vertical distance; and a steep slope means an inclined area, the inclination of which is greater than three units of horizontal distance to one unit of vertical distance. No other criteria apply.
        Commentary: The moderate and steep slope definitions in this section are mandated by State law (S.L. 2009-486) for sedimentation and erosion control purposes. This steep slope definition differs from the steep slope definition under UDO Sec. 8.8, Steep Slope Protection Standards, which is otherwise applicable throughout the UDO.
        b. Soil Stockpiles
        Soil stockpiles shall be limited to the shorter of 30 feet above existing grade or half the height of adjacent existing mature tree cover. Stockpiles shall be wrapped in two rows of silt fence, and groundcover shall be planted in accordance with this section. Stockpile slopes shall be 2:1 or flatter.
    2. Completed Activity
    For any area of land-disturbing activity where grading activities have been completed, temporary or permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion shall be provided as soon as practicable, but in no case later than seven days after completion of grading.
C. Stabilization of Sedimentation and Erosion Control Devices
Whenever land-disturbing activity exceeds 12,000 square feet, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install such sedimentation and erosion control devices and practices as are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of such tract, and shall plant or otherwise provide a temporary ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion generated by such devices and practices within seven days.
D. Erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures and devices shall be so planned, designed and constructed as to provide protection from the calculated maximum peak of runoff from the 25-year storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the USDA, Soil Conservation Service's "National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices," or other calculation procedures acceptable to the Sedimentation and Erosion Control Officer or designee.
E. Each sediment basin or trap in the Suburban or Rural Tier shall have a minimum volume of 3,600 cubic feet per acre of disturbed area and a minimum surface area of 435 square feet per cfs of Q25 (25-year storm) peak inflow. Each sediment basin or trap in the Downtown, Compact Neighborhood, or Urban Tier shall have a minimum volume of 1,800 cubic feet per acre of disturbed area and a minimum surface area of 325 square feet per cfs of Q25 peak inflow. A skimmer shall be used in each sediment basin or trap. If the temporary sediment basin or trap is to be converted to a permanent stormwater control measure and the volume is greater than that of the temporary basin, the larger of the two shall be used, unless approved in writing by the Durham County Erosion Control Office.
F. Sediment basins and traps shall be designed and constructed such that the basin will have a settling efficiency of at least 70% for the 40-micron (0.04mm) size soil particle transported into the basin by the runoff of that two-year storm that produces the maximum peak rate of runoff as calculated according to procedures in the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service's "National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices" or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of the State or the United States or any generally recognized organization or association.
G. Sediment basins and traps shall not be installed in perennial or intermittent streams.
H. Existing ponds and lakes shall not be used as sediment basins or traps.
I. Developer shall retain control of permitted area, including sediment basins or traps, until permit has been closed. For commercial sites, sold outparcels shall be permitted separately.
J. Newly constructed open channels shall be designed and constructed with side slopes no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical if a vegetative cover is used for stabilization, unless soil conditions permit steeper slopes or where the slopes are stabilized by using mechanical devices, structural devices or other acceptable ditch liners. In any event, the angle for side slopes shall be sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion.
K. Additional areas may be added per the criteria enumerated in this section only if the basin or trap is properly installed and maintained.
L. In high quality water (HQW) zones, Lake Michie/Little River Critical Area (M/LR-A), Lake Michie/Little River Protected Area (M/LR-B), Falls/Jordan Critical Area (F/J-A), Eno River Critical Area (E-A), and Third Fork Creek Watershed, uncovered areas shall be limited at any time to a maximum total area of 20 acres. In high quality water (HQW) zones, only the portion of the land-disturbing activity within a HQW zone shall be governed by this section. Larger areas within HQW may be uncovered with the written approval of the Director of DEQ, Division of Energy, Mineral and Land Resources. Larger areas within all other zones may be uncovered with the written approval of the Durham County Erosion Control Office.

12.10.5 Permanent Downstream Protection of Stream Banks, Channels and Slopes
A. Intent
Stream banks and channels downstream from any land-disturbing activity shall be protected from increased degradation by accelerated erosion caused by increased velocity of runoff from the land-disturbing activity.
B. Performance Standard
The land-disturbing activity shall be planned and conducted such that the velocity of stormwater runoff in the receiving watercourse at the point of discharge resulting from a 25-year storm after development shall not exceed the greater of:
    1. The velocity specified according to the soil type in the following table, for a point of discharge into a receiving watercourse with bare soil or rock banks or bed;

E. Acceptable Management Measures
Measures applied alone or in combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are no objectionable secondary consequences. The State Sedimentation Control Commission recognizes that the management of stormwater runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and bank erosion is a developing technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce successful results. Some alternatives are to:
    1. Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas rendered impervious;
    2. Avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in lieu of closed drains and high velocity paved sections;
    3. Provide energy dissipaters at outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities at the point of discharge. These may range from simple rip-rapped sections to complex structures; and
    4. Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving cross sections and/or providing erosion-resistant lining.
F. Exceptions
This section shall not apply where it can be demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Sedimentation and Erosion Control Officer or designee that stormwater discharge velocities will not create an erosion problem in the receiving watercourses.

12.10.6 Borrow and Waste Areas
When the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is also the person conducting the borrow or waste disposal activity, areas from which borrow is obtained and which are not regulated by the provisions of the Mining Act of 1971, and waste areas for surplus materials other than landfills regulated by the State Department of Environmental Qualitys Division of Solid Waste Management, shall be considered as part of the land-disturbing activity where the borrow material is being used or from which the waste material originated. When the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is not the person obtaining the borrow and/or disposing of the waste, these areas shall be considered a separate land-disturbing activity. The name and location of any borrow and/or waste areas shall be provided to the Durham County Erosion Control Office upon request.

12.10.7 Access and Haul Roads
Temporary access and haul roads, other than public roads, constructed or used in connection with any land-disturbing activity shall be considered a part of such activity.

12.10.8 Operations in Lakes or Natural Watercourses
Land-disturbing activity in connection with construction in, on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse shall minimize the extent and duration of disruption of the stream channel. Where relocation of a stream forms an essential part of the proposed activity, the relocation shall minimize unnecessary changes in the stream flow characteristics.

12.10.9 Responsibility for Maintenance
During the development of a site, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install and maintain all temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation control measures as required by the North Carolina Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973, as amended, and all rules and orders adopted pursuant to it (the Act), this section, rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this section or the Act, or an approved sedimentation and erosion control plan. After site development, the land owner or person in possession or control of the land shall install and/or maintain all necessary permanent erosion and sediment control measures, except those measures installed within a road or street right-of-way or easement accepted for maintenance by a governmental agency.

12.10.10 Self-Inspections
Where inspections are required by paragraph 3.8.6, Self-Inspections, the following apply:
A. The person who performs the inspection shall make a record of the site inspection by documenting the following items:
    1. All of the erosion and sedimentation control measures, practices and devices, as called for in a construction sequence consistent with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan, including but not limited to sedimentation control basins, sedimentation traps, sedimentation ponds, rock dams, temporary diversions, temporary slope drains, rock check dams, sediment fence or barriers, all forms of inlet protection, storm drainage facilities, energy dissipaters, and stabilization methods of open channels, have initially been installed and do not significantly deviate (as defined in paragraph 12.10.10A.5) from the locations, dimensions and relative elevations shown on the approved erosion and sedimentation plan. Such documentation shall be accomplished by initialing and dating each measure or practice shown on a copy of the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or by completing, dating and signing an inspection report that lists each measure, practice or device shown on the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan. This documentation is required only upon the initial installation of the erosion and sedimentation control measures, practices and devices as set forth by the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or if the measures, practices and devices are modified after initial installation;
    2. The completion of any phase of grading for all graded slopes and fills shown on the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan, specifically noting the location and condition of the graded slopes and fills. Such documentation shall be accomplished by initialing and dating a copy of the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or by completing, dating and signing an inspection report;
    3. The location of temporary or permanent ground cover, and that the installation of the ground cover does not significantly deviate (as defined in paragraph 12.10.10A.5) from the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan. Such documentation shall be accomplished by initialing and dating a copy of the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or by completing, dating and signing an inspection report;
    4. That maintenance and repair requirements for all temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation control measures, practices and devices have been performed. Such documentation shall be accomplished by completing, dating and signing an inspection report (the general stormwater permit monitoring form may be used to verify the maintenance and repair requirements); and
    5. Any significant deviations from the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan, corrective actions required to correct the deviation and completion of the corrective actions. Such documentation shall be accomplished by initialing and dating a copy of the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or by completing, dating and signing an inspection report. A significant deviation means an omission, alteration or relocation of an erosion or sedimentation control measure that prevents the measure from performing as intended.
B. The documentation, whether on a copy of the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or an inspection report, shall include the name, address, affiliation, telephone number, and signature of the person conducting the inspection and the date of the inspection. Any relevant licenses and certifications may also be included. Any documentation of inspections that occur on a copy of the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan shall occur on a single copy of the plan and that plan shall be made available on the site. Any inspection reports shall also be made available on the site.
C. The inspection shall be performed during or after each of the following phases of a plan:
    1. Installation of perimeter erosion and sediment control measures;
    2. Clearing and grubbing of existing ground cover;
    3. Completion of any phase of grading of slopes or fills that requires provision of temporary or permanent ground cover pursuant to NCGS § 113A-57(2);
    4. Completion of storm drainage facilities;
    5. Completion of construction or development; and
    6. Quarterly until the establishment of permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion or until the financially responsible party has conveyed ownership or control of the tract of land for which the erosion and sedimentation control plan has been approved and the agency that approved the plan has been notified. If the financially responsible party has conveyed ownership or control of the tract of land for which the erosion and sedimentation control plan has been approved, the new owner or person in control shall conduct and document inspections quarterly until the establishment of permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion.

12.10.11 Additional Measures
Whenever the Sedimentation and Erosion Control Officer, or designee, determines that significant sedimentation is occurring as a result of land-disturbing activity, despite application and maintenance of protective practices, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity will be required to and shall take the additional protective action directed.

B. Amount
    1. The responsible department shall require a performance guarantee in the amount of 125% of the reasonable estimated cost, as determined by the applicable director or designee, to complete the infrastructure or other improvement calculated as of the time the performance guarantee is issued. Administrative costs, inflation, and other contingencies shall be allowed for estimating the cost.
    2. Any extension of the performance guarantee necessary to complete required improvements shall not exceed 125% of the reasonably estimated cost, as determined by the applicable director or designee, of completion of the remaining incomplete improvements still outstanding at the time the extension is obtained.
C. Timing
Where the improvements have not been completed before final plat approval or issuance of a certificate of compliance for a building within the approved project, the responsible department director(s) or designee(s) shall specify the time period within which such improvements must be completed.

12.11.2 Form and Conditions of Performance Guarantee
A. Form
A performance guarantee may be in the form of a surety bond, letter of credit, or other form of guarantee that provides equivalent security to a surety bond or letter of credit.
B. Conditions
A performance guarantee shall be conditioned upon the performance of all work necessary to complete the specified improvements and the delivery of all necessary encroachment agreements, with said performance and delivery to be done within a stipulated time period.
C. Release of Guarantee
The performance guarantee shall be returned or released, as appropriate, in a timely manner upon the acknowledgment by the City or County that the improvements and conditions for which the performance guarantee is being required are complete.
D. Extension
If the improvements are not complete and the current performance guarantee is expiring, the performance guarantee shall be extended, or a new performance guarantee issued, for an additional period until such required improvements are complete. A developer shall demonstrate reasonable, good faith progress toward completion of the required improvements that are the subject of the performance guarantee or any extension.

12.11.3 Issuance of Certificate of Compliance
For required improvements other than infrastructure, if the responsible department director or designee determines the completion of the improvement prior to issuance of a certificate of compliance is not practicable, and sufficient justification for the delay has been shown, certificates of compliance may be issued if an adequate performance guarantee is provided. In such event, the requirements for performance guarantees within this section shall apply.

14.1.3       Continuation of Nonconformities
14.1.4       Maintenance and Repair
14.1.5       Completion of Buildings and Improvements

14.1.1 Purpose
Zoning regulations established by the adoption of this Ordinance or amendments to this Ordinance may cause properties and uses which were lawful prior to the adoption of certain regulation to not meet requirements after adoption of the regulations. The purpose of this section is to establish procedures and regulations for the use of those properties or structures which are in conflict with the requirements of this Ordinance. It is not the intent of this section to encourage the continuance of nonconformities that are out of character with the standards of the zoning district. It is the intent of this section, however, to allow certain nonconforming situations to continue as legal exceptions to this Ordinance.

14.1.2 Nonconformities Defined
A nonconformity shall be any use, lot, improvement, or structure that, as a result of amendments to this Ordinance or a preexisting condition, does not meet the current standards of the Ordinance.
A. Nonconforming Use
A nonconforming use shall be any land use or type of residential use that was legally established but has become a prohibited use in the district in which it exists.
B. Nonconforming Lot
A nonconforming lot shall be any legally established parcel that does not conform to the current area or dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.
C. Nonconforming Improvement or Structure
A nonconforming improvement or structure shall be any legally established improvement, building or structure that fails to meet current Ordinance standards for setback, height, or similar factors.

14.1.3 Continuation of Nonconformities
Legal nonconformities may continue subject to the limitations of this Article. Continuation, reconstruction, alteration, and/or expansion of such nonconformities shall be subject to the provisions of this Article.

14.1.4 Maintenance and Repair
Nothing in this section shall prohibit the ordinary maintenance and repair of a nonconformity, including but not limited to repairs required by the Durham Housing Code, except that nonconforming structures that have suffered repetitive loss due to flooding shall not be permitted to be repaired. Maintenance and repair shall be subject to issuance of building permits, as is required by the Building Code.

14.1.5 Completion of Buildings and Improvements
A. Nonconformities Resulting from Adoption of This Ordinance or Other Governmental Action
Completion of buildings that become nonconforming as a result of passage of this Ordinance or another governmental action shall be allowed if an application for a building permit sufficient to allow approval was submitted prior to passage of this Ordinance, and if the building is subsequently completed in accordance with an approved building permit within two years of initial issuance of the permit. In addition, completion of buildings for which building permits were not applied for may be allowed under the Transitional provisions of this Ordinance. Completion of improvements other than buildings that become nonconforming as a result of passage of this Ordinance shall be governed by the Transitional provisions of this Ordinance.
B. Subsequent Nonconformities
Completion of buildings that are created by amendments to this Ordinance or another governmental action shall be allowed if a building permit was issued prior to the amendment, if the permit remains continuously valid, and if the building is completed within two years of initial issuance of the permit. Completion of buildings or improvements for which permits were not issued, but that are subject to site plans or preliminary plats that were approved prior to the Ordinance amendment, shall be governed by the provisions regarding continuous validity of site plans and preliminary plats found elsewhere in this Ordinance.

Sec. 14.2 Nonconforming Uses

Paragraphs:
14.2.1       Limitations on Nonconforming Uses
14.2.2       Changes to Nonconforming Uses (City Only)
14.2.3       Abandonment
14.2.4       Damage/Destruction
14.2.5       Home Occupations
14.2.6       Single-Family Use Exemption
A nonconforming use may be continued (though for some uses the period of time within which the use may be continued may be limited). If a nonconforming use or activity is governed elsewhere in this Ordinance, such as in Sec. 5.3, Limited Use Standards, the stricter of those provisions or the provisions below shall apply where there is a conflict in provisions. Otherwise, all applicable restrictions shall apply. The provisions below shall not be interpreted to change any amortization period or buffering requirement applicable elsewhere in this Ordinance to specifically identified nonconforming uses.

14.2.1 Limitations on Nonconforming Uses
Except as specified in paragraph 14.2.2, Changes to Nonconforming Uses (City Only), nonconforming uses shall be subject to the following restrictions, in addition to restrictions that may be imposed by other provisions of this ordinance or by conditions within a special use permit or other approved plan or permit:
A. Floor area shall not be enlarged, except for improvements that allow existing buildings to meet local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or that are necessary to ensure safe living or occupancy conditions;
B. Residential density shall not be increased;
C. Lot coverage shall not be increased;
D. The nonconforming use shall not expand in degree, frequency, intensity, or impact of the activity;
E. The nonconforming use shall not be relocated to another portion of a lot, except as allowed in the City pursuant to provisions authorizing the issuance of special use permits for certain nonconforming uses, described below; and,
F. The nonconforming use shall not be changed to a different nonconforming use, except as allowed in the City pursuant to provisions authorizing the issuance of special use permits for certain nonconforming uses, described below.

14.2.2 Changes to Nonconforming Uses (City Only)
A. A single-family residential nonconforming use can be expanded one time during its existence through enlargement of the floor area of the building associated with the nonconforming use by a maximum of 10% or 500 square feet, whichever is greater, and an associated increase in lot coverage, provided that such expansion complies with all development standards of the established zoning district in which the nonconforming use is located at the time of expansion.
B. Nonconforming uses located on a boulevard or major/minor thoroughfare may be changed to a different nonconforming use, or range of uses, or relocated on the same site, upon issuance of a minor special use permit pursuant to Sec. 3.9, Special Use Permit. The Board of Adjustment may limit the time period for which such a use permit is valid, if it determines such limitation is necessary or in the public interest. In order to issue such a permit, in addition to consideration of all criteria generally applicable to special uses, the Board of Adjustment shall find that:
    1. The proposed new nonconforming use, if a new nonconforming use is proposed, is more compatible with the development pattern of the surrounding area than the previous nonconforming use; and
    2. Mitigation measures included as specific conditions in the permit, if necessary, are adequate to provide protection for nearby properties; and,
    3. The proposed use, range of uses, or relocation of uses reduces the impacts on the surrounding area in comparison with the established nonconformity. In making this determination, the Board of Adjustment may consider factors such as:
        a. Whether the proposed new nonconforming use is considered less intense than the previous nonconforming use considering the uses permitted in each zoning district and the hierarchy of zoning districts established in paragraph 4.1.1, Establishment of Districts, with the districts listed in order from least intense to most intense;
        b. Whether the proposed new nonconforming use can be expected to generate less traffic, particularly peak hour traffic, than the previous nonconforming use; and,
        c. Whether the proposed new use can be expected to result in a decrease in parking demand from the previous nonconforming use.

14.2.3 Abandonment

        A suspended sidewalk system shall be required in the Core and S1 sub-districts of the DD and CD Districts.
    3. Alternative Street Tree Requirement
    Commentary: Street trees provide core functions within the urban environment. Street trees provide shade, aesthetics, and help distinguish the pedestrian way from travel lanes. The alternatives are intended to provide at least two of these functions when such alternatives are allowed. Encroachment agreements with the City or NCDOT, as applicable, may be required.
        a. Applicability
            (1) If an existing easement prohibits the placement of street trees in the prescribed location per paragraph E2, above, an alternative can be provided in lieu of the street tree requirement.
            (2) Except in the CSD District, where development incorporates existing buildings and the distance from the back-of-curb to the building face is less than 10 feet, an alternative can be provided in lieu of the street tree requirement.
            (3) Street tree alternatives shall not be used for pedestrian malls.
        b. Alternatives
        Street tree alternatives specified below shall be used, individually or in combination, and shall comply with the associated standards.
            (1) Spacing and location requirements shall be consistent with those required for street trees.
            (2) Maintenance of alternatives shall be the responsibility of the property owner(s) of the development site.

    1. The project will not create negative effects on the surrounding properties; and
    2. The project will be aesthetically harmonious with or complementary to the surrounding buildings and streetscape, and will not have a substantial negative impact on downtown views.
E. Temporary Pedestrian Paths and Bus Stops
    1. Any existing pedestrian right-of-way that will be inaccessible for more than seven days shall require approval of a pedestrian traffic control plan as per MUTCD standards. Prior to the path becoming inaccessible, the pedestrian traffic control plan shall be submitted to and approved by the Transportation Director or designee, and NCDOT, as applicable, through the construction drawing approval process. Pedestrian traffic control plans shall include new or temporary pedestrian circulation routes and pedestrian protection measures, as appropriate.
    2. Any existing bus stop that will be inaccessible for more than seven days, or any existing bus shelter that will be inaccessible for more than thirty days, shall require approval of an alternate bus stop and/or bus shelter location and accessible path to the bus stop and/or bus shelter, as applicable. Prior to the bus stop and/or bus shelter becoming inaccessible, the alternative shall be submitted to and approved by the Transportation Director or designee, NCDOT, and GoTriangle, as applicable, through the construction drawing approval process.
