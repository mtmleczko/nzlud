PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Gahanna, Ohio. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2015 Code, as supplemented through December 31, 2015, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2015 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1  
(Index or Indexes) 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Dennis Sinnett, Vice President, Supplementation, and Lauren Coulter, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Kimberly Banning, Clerk of Council and Kayla Holbrook, Deputy Clerk of Council for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable year, the Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year. 
(f)  Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this Section 161.052 shall not apply to the extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section 161.051 of this Chapter. 
(g)  In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division, a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining. Notwithstanding division (d) of this Section 161.052, if, during a calendar year, the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on which the individual performed services at the refinery.

As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight; 
(2)  Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which taxes are not-required to be withheld under Section 161.052 of this Chapter;

B.  The exclusion of one or more of the factors;

(2)  Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits the employer; 
(3)  Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this Section 161.062 solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

(e)  The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit resides. 
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located. 
(f)  (1)  Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this Section 161.062, commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the real estate is located.

(2)  An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the extent that such credit is allowed under Section 161.081 of this Chapter. 
(g)  If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from taxation under divisions (11)L. and (34)A.4. of Section 161.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal corporation under this Section 161.062.

(3)  The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division (g) of Section 161.091 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time. 
(4)  Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each fiscal year or period. 
(5)  The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as provided in this Section 161.07. 
(c)  (1)  The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows: 
A.  On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year; 
B.  On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year;

D.  On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year. 
(2)  A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (c)(1)A. through D. of this Section 161.07. 
(3)  On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid with the return in accordance with Section 161.091 of this Chapter. 
A.  For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended pursuant to division (g) of Section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code.

(2)  The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal corporation under Section 161.091 of this Chapter for that year. 
(3)  The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.

161.08 - CREDIT FOR TAX PAID 
161.081 - CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY 
(a)  Each resident shall be allowed a nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed under this Chapter with respect to that resident's Creditable Income. For purposes of this Section 161.081, "Creditable Income" means, with respect to any Taxable Year, the portion of a resident's income (1) on which the resident paid municipal income tax to a municipality other than the City of Gahanna, or (2) with respect to which the employer of the resident withheld the municipal income tax of a municipality other than the City of Gahanna. Creditable Income shall not include income on which taxes were paid or withheld to the extent the resident is eligible to receive a refund of such taxes from the other municipality. 
(b)  The credit under division (a) of this Section 161.081 shall be equal to the product calculated by multiplying the following two (2) numbers: 
(1)  Eighty-three and one-third percent (83-1/3%). 
(2)  The lesser of the following amounts for the Taxable Year: 
A.  The tax paid on the Creditable Income to the other municipality; OR 
B.  The tax imposed under this Chapter, prior to application of this credit. 
(c)  For purposes of this Section 161.081, "Net Proceeds" means the total proceeds collected from the tax imposed under this Chapter on the Creditable Income of all residents, after the application of the credit under division (a). Until otherwise determined by the Municipality's City Council, the Net Proceeds for each fiscal year, as those Net Proceeds are verified by the Tax Administrator, shall be expended for capital improvements and equipment in the following categories: 
(1)  Safety; 
(2)  Streets; and 
(3)  Stormwater Maintenance. 
(d)  The credit became effective with respect to taxable income earned and/or received on and after January 1, 1989, and the purpose of and intention behind the revisions made to this Section (at that time numbered Section 161.18) on January 6, 2015, are to provide clarification and to carry out the intent behind the credit since such effective date. 
(e)  The Municipality's City Council shall conduct a minimum of three (3) public hearings at least 60 days prior to any amendment of this Section 161.081. 
(Ord. No. 0121-2015 ,  1(Exh. A), 12-7-15) 
161.082 - REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS 
(a)  As used in this Section 161.082: 
(1)  "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(2)  A.  Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this Section 161.082, "qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
B.  If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this Section 161.082 computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this Section 161.082 and a fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
C.  With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
(3)  "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
(b)  (1) Except as provided in division (D) of this Section 161.082, a refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate. 
(2)  A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this Section 161.082 from each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable years. 
(3)  If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
(4)  In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this Section 161.082 exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
(c)  (1)  For purposes of this Section 161.082, municipal corporation income tax that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
(2)  Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the municipal corporation by the taxpayer. 
(d)  The credit allowed under this Section 161.082 is allowed only to the extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to: 
(1)  The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or 
(2)  The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred compensation. 
(Ord. No. 0121-2015 ,  1(Exh. A), 12-7-15) 
161.083 - CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR ZONE 
    A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section 161.081 of this Chapter. 
(Ord. No. 0121-2015 ,  1(Exh. A), 12-7-15) 
161.084 - CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND 
(a)  Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds as provided in Section 161.096 of this Chapter. 
(b)  Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as provided in Section 161.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the period of nonpayment. 
(c)  No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section 161.096 of this Chapter. 
(d)  Nothing in this Section 161.084 requires the Municipality to allow credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section 161.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 0121-2015 ,  1(Exh. A), 12-7-15) 
161.09 - ANNUAL RETURN 
161.091 - RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX

Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury. 
(2)  A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this Section 161.091, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this Section 161.091 electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed. 
(3)  A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund required under this Section 161.091, copies of only the following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return. 
(4)  A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a portal provided by the Municipality. The Department of Taxation is expected to publish a method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department will transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to the Tax Administrator. 
(5)  After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of this Section 161.091 apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. 
(6)  Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator of undocumented credits or losses. 
(g)  (1)  A. Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each individual income tax return required to be filed under this Section 161.091 shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division (g) of Section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax Administrator. 
B.  Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each annual net profit income tax return required to be filed under this Section 161.091 by a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax Administrator. 
C.  In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount shown to be due is ten dollars or less. 
(2)  If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this Section 161.091, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns. 
(3)  With respect to taxpayers to whom Section 161.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts with any provision in Section 161.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section 161.092 of this Chapter prevails. 
(h)  (1) For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount due is ten dollars or less. 
(2)  Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a taxable year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this Section 161.091 shall file with the Municipality an annual net profit return under division (f)(3) of this Section 161.091. 
(I)  This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under division (b)(1)B. or C. of Section 161.051 of this Chapter. 
(1)  If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under this Chapter is delivered after that period or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment. "The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service. 
(2)  If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this Section 161.091, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer. 
(j)  The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of an employer, or other payer as described in Section 161.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld. 
(k)  Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance with this Section 161.091 shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return. The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters. 
(l)  The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents. 
(m)  When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature. 
(n)  (1)  As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same meaning as in Section 161.052 of this Chapter. 
(2)  A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does not expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable year if both of the following conditions apply: 
A.  The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who has not complied with the provisions of this Chapter. 
B.  The person no longer provides services in the municipal corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's income tax for the taxable year. The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury. 
C.  If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of this Section 161.091, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the provisions of this Chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in division (N) of this Section 161.091 prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an audit of the person.

(a)  Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance with this Chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates.

A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of this Section 161.092 shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this Section 161.092, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in support of the armed forces. 
B.  Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with division (c)(2)A. of this Section 161.092 are not delinquent during the extension period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of this Section 161.092 in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax. 
(d)  For each taxable year to which division (a), (b), or (c) of this Section 161.092 applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (b)(2) and (3) or (c) of this Section 161.092, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.

In no event shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties involved in the activity or transaction. 
(j)  An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this Section 161.16 or a refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) may not be appealed. 
(Ord. No. 0121-2015 ,  1(Exh. A), 12-7-15) 
161.17 - ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY 
(a)  (1)  The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
(2)  The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this Section 161.17, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be authorized by the person subject to the assessment. 
(3)  Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Ohio Revised Code is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served. 
(b)  (1)  A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under this Section 161.17 bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this Section 161.17, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this Section 161.17, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business. 
(2)  If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described in division (b)(1) of this Section 161.17, and if that assessment is subject to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review. 
(Ord. No. 0121-2015 ,  1(Exh. A), 12-7-15) 
161.18 - LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW 
(A)  (1)  The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
(2)  The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the Municipality. Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof. 
(3)  The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of the administrative official. 
(4)  Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section 718.11(a)(4) of the Ohio Revised Code. 
(5)  A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this Section 161.18 shall resign immediately by operation of law. 
(6)  A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board. 
(7)  If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve. 
(b)  Whenever the Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed. 
(c)  Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the taxpayer receives the assessment. 
(d)  The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of this Section 161.18, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise. 
(e)  The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's final determination as provided in Section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
(f)  The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this Section 161.18 shall adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs, and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this Section 161.18 are not meetings of a public body subject to Section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing. 
(Ord. No. 0121-2015 ,  1(Exh. A), 12-7-15)

The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this Section 161.19 may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit described in division (c) of this Section 161.19. 
(2)  As used in this Section 161.19, "qualifying deferral period" means a period of time beginning and ending as follows: 
A.  Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section 161.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that assessment. 
B.  Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is available or taken. 
(b)  Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission of the offense.

(d)  (1)  Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal. 
(2)  If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created under Section 161.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section 161.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division (d) of this Section 161.19. 
(d)  No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods: 
(1)  The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties; 
(2)  The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

Any reference in this Chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this Section and Section 161.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this Section shall control for all uses of that term in Sections 161.50 to 161.65 of the Codified Ordinances.

B.  Division (b)(4)(A) of this Section does not apply to the extent the income or gain is income or gain described in Section 1245 or 1250 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(5)  Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income. 
(6)  In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.

(8)  Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income. 
(9)  Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in the group's federal taxable income in accordance with Section 161.063(e)(3)(B) of the Codified Ordinances. 
(10)  Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the group's federal taxable income in accordance with Section 161.063(e)(3)(B) of the Codified Ordinances. 
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has made the election described in Section 161.03(47)(B) of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in Section 161.03(23)(D) of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable income under this Section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under Section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.

Nothing in division (b) of this Section shall be construed as allowing the taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of federal self-employment tax. 
(c)  Taxpayer has the same meaning as in Section 161.03 of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of the Revised Code.

(e)  Taxable year means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant to this Chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections 161.50 to 161.65 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The Tax Commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year. 
(f)  Assessment means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax issued pursuant to Section 161.03 of the Codified Ordinances.

161.52 - APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT. 
    This Section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or profession in the City and that has made the election under Section 161.50 of the Codified Ordinances. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this Section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the average ratio of the following: 
(1)  The average original cost of the real property and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. 
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight; 
(2)  Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section 161.051 of the Codified Ordinances; 
(3)  Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed. 
(b)  (1)  If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this Section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in the City, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the following: 
A.  Separate accounting; 
B.  The exclusion of one or more of the factors; 
C.  The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the municipal corporation; 
D.  A modification of one or more of the factors. 
(2)  A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (a) of Section 161.50 of the Codified Ordinances. 
(3)  The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this Section only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division (a) of Section 161.60 of the Codified Ordinances. 
(c)  As used in division (a)(2) of this Section, "wages, salaries, and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations: 
(1)  A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or under the possession of one of the following: 
A.  The employer; 
B.  A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient; 
C.  A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in division (c)(1)(B) of this Section, or a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient. 
(2)  Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits the employer; 
(3)  Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this Section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax Commissioner's determination was unreasonable. 
(d)  For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this Section, receipts from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City as follows: 
(1)  Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be sitused to the City only if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets either of the following criteria: 
A.  The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from a stock of goods located within the City. 
B.  The property is delivered within the City from a location outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion. 
(2)  Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the City to the extent that such services are performed in the City. 
(3)  To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City. 
(4)  To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City. 
(5)  Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the tangible personal property is used in the City. 
(E)  Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the City based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the City to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year. 
(f)  If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from taxation under divisions(11)(l) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section 161.03 of the Codified Ordinances by the City or substantially similar provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the City any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. 
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City under this Section. 
(g)  When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this Section for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this Section, the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity. 
( Ord. No. 0047-2018,  1(Exh. A), 6-4-18 ) 
161.53 - INFORMATION PROVIDED TO TAX ADMINISTRATORS; CONFIDENTIALITY. 
(a)  Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations, hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Sections 161.50 to 161.65 of the Codified Ordinances is confidential, and no person shall disclose such information, except for official purposes, in accordance with a proper judicial order, or as provided in Sections 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the Revised Code.

A.  Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purpose of making the computations required in Section 161.52 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group. 
B.  Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purpose of making the computations required in Section 161.52 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation.

B.  The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections 161.50 to 161.65 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group. 
(f)  Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the computations required under Section 161.52 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section. 
(g)  Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other amounts applicable under Sections 161.50 to 161.65 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated group.

(3)  A.  Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to each municipal corporation for the taxable year.

(4)  If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by Sections 161.50 to 161.65 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration of Sections 161.50 to 161.65 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to $500.00 may be imposed. 
(5)  If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections 161.50 to 161.65 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of $1,000.00 or 100 percent of the tax required to be shown on the return.

( Ord. No. 0047-2018,  1(Exh. A), 6-4-18 ) 
161.60 - ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER. 
(a)  If any taxpayer required to file a return under Sections 161.50 to 161.65 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for the period covered by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the return or tax is due, based upon any information in the Commissioner's possession. 
    The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Commissioner consent in writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time limit in Section 161.61 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to assessment as required by Sections 161.50 to 161.65 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The Commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided in Section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the Commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the petition. 
(b)  Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within 60 days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the taxpayer to the Treasurer of State. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by the Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the petition has been properly filed, the Commissioner shall proceed under Section 5703.60 of the Revised Code. 
(c)  After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of the Clerk of the Court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin County. 
    Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments. Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to sales made under the judgment. 
    If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within 60 days after the day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the day the Commissioner issues the assessment until the assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for collection under Section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an assessment under this Section. 
(d)  All money collected under this Section shall be credited to the municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this Section. 
(e)  If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are instituted without delay, the Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the jeopardy assessment, the Commissioner shall file an entry with the Clerk of the Court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (c) of this Section. Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in Section 5703.37 of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk. The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of this Section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the Commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the Commissioner's consideration of the petition for reassessment. 
(f)  Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending, the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the Treasurer of State does not prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition. 
    If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section 161.61 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by that section.

The application shall be filed in the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. 
(b)  (1)  On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled.

(a)  If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section 161.50 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under Sections 161.50 to 161.65 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than 60 days after the adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.

TITLE NINE - Judicial 
CHAPTER 171 - Mayor's Court[30] 
Footnotes: 
--- (30) --- 
Editor's note- The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate. 
Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not exceed a fine of $100.00. Ohio R. C. 2937.08 and Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the defendant: 
(a) Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six months, or 
(b) Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty prescribed is a fine greater than $100.00 and/or imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto." 
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due process clause of the United States Constitution. 
The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases. Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v. Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v. Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality." 
The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court, continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date." 
Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

303.083 - RELEASE OF VEHICLE; RECORDS; CHARGES. 
Editor's note- The provisions of former Section 303.083 as amended are now codified in Section 303.081. 
303.09 - LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION. 
(a)  No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more than 72 consecutive hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of any road or highway, for 48 consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place. 
    For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment. Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality. 
(b)  Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. 
(ORC 4513.64) 
303.10 - LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than 72 hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12; or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle. 
    Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's vehicle stored in the open. 
    Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the property. 
    No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of 30 days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate offense. 
(b)  Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following: 
1.  Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk; 
2.  Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection. 
B.  In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection. 
(2)  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following: 
A.  Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk. 
B.  Other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(3)  A.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication, as provided in Section 313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed. 
B.  Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control device, shall not cross the roadway. 
(b)  Steady Yellow Signal Indication: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow signal indication is displayed. 
(2)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed. 
(3)  Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as provided in Section 313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway. 
(c)  Steady Red Signal Indication: 
(1)  A.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3) of this section. 
B.  Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop sign. 
(2)  A.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is displayed. 
B.

(d)  When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality. 
(e)  Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person. 
(f)  This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting, this Municipality. 
(g)  For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed. 
(h)  As used in this section, "computer", "computer system", "computer network", "information service", "telecommunication", "telecommunications device", "telecommunications service", "data", and "writing" have the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.

(1)  For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years; 
(2)  For a minor misdemeanor, six months. 
(b)  If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is not himself a party to the offense. 
(c)  (1)  If the period of limitation provided in this section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the following specified periods of time: 
A.  For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years thereafter; 
B.  For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two years thereafter. 
(2)  As used in this subsection: 
A.  An "offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant" includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant. 
B.  "Public servant" has the same meaning as in Section 525.01. 
(d)  An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct, the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first. 
(e)  A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence is exercised to execute the same. 
(f)  The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus delicti remains undiscovered.

(j)  This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the Municipal income tax ordinance. 
(ORC 2901.13) 
501.07 - REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply: 
(1)  The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is capable of performing; 
(2)  The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the offense. 
(b)  When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability. 
(c)  (1)  When language defining an element of an offense that is related to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts recklessly. 
(2)  Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined in the Traffic Code. 
(3)  Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition incorporated into the offense. 
(d)  Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged. 
(e)  As used in this section: 
(1)  Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession. 
(2)  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's volition, are involuntary acts. 
(3)  "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence, as defined in Section 501.08. 
(4)  "Intoxication" includes, but is not limited to, intoxication resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
(ORC 2901.21) 
501.08 - CULPABLE MENTAL STATES. 
(a)  A person acts purposely when it is the person's specific intention to cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby, it is the offender's specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature. 
(b)  A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is aware that the person's conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
    When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact. 
(c)  A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the person's conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist. 
(d)  A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person's conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may exist. 
(e)  When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element. 
(ORC 2901.22) 
501.09 - ATTEMPT. 
(a)  No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense. 
(b)  It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect, commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to be. 
(c)  No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in violation of this section. 
(d)  It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the actor abandoned the actor's effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of the actor's criminal purpose. 
(e)  Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under this section. 
(f)  As used in this section, "drug abuse offense" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02) 
501.10 - COMPLICITY. 
(a)  No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense, shall do any of the following: 
(1)  Solicit or procure another to commit the offense; 
(2)  Aid or abet another in committing the offense; 
(3)  Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense. 
(b)  It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender. 
(c)  No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section 501.09. 
(d)  If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following: 
    "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution. 
    "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and worth or its lack of quality and worth." 
(e)  It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that, prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose. 
(f)  Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this section, or in terms of the principal offense. 
(ORC 2923.03) 
501.11 - ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY. 
(a)  An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the following circumstances: 
(1)  The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of the officer's, agent's or employee's office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply. 
(2)  A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of the officer's, agent's or employee's office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply. 
(3)  The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty imposed by law on the organization. 
(4)  If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded, tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or employment. 
(b)  If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the contrary plainly appears. 
(c)  In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of the section defining the offense. 
(d)  As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. 
(ORC 2901.23) 
501.12 - PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT. 
(a)  An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section 501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense, and any of the following apply: 
(1)  In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct responsibility; 
(2)  He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged. 
(b)  When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. 
(ORC 2901.24) 
501.13 - CONSPIRACY. 
(a)  No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson, arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs, or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio R.C.

(2)  Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified offenses. 
(b)  No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the accused's entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed. 
(c)  When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring with that other person, even though the other person's identity may be unknown to the offender. 
(d)  It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect, commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible under the circumstances. 
(e)  A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed. 
(f)  A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship. 
(g)  When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the same offense. 
(h)  (1)  No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence. 
(2)  If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court, when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following: 
"The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not become inadmissible because of the accomplice's complicity, moral turpitude, or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect the witness' credibility and make the witness' testimony subject to grave suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution. 
It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and worth or its lack of quality and worth".

(j)  Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree. 
(k)  This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code, other than this section. In such a case, however: 
(1)  With respect to the offense specified as the object of the conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the conspiracy; 
(2)  Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code. 
(l)  (1)  In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C. 2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2981.06.

501.99 - PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS. 
(a)  Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions authorized under this section. If the court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Restitution. Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim. 
If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from the offender. 
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18. 
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five percent of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments. 
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate. 
(2)  Fines. A fine in the following amount: 
A.  For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $1,000.00); 
B.  For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750.00;

D.  For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250.00; 
E.  For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.00. 
F.  For an unclassified misdemeanor, up to $1,000.00 and/or 500 hours of community service.

1.  All or part of the costs of implementing any community control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021; 
2.  All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of repairing property damaged by the offender while confined. 
B.  The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section. (ORC 2929.28) 
(b)  Jail Terms. 
(1)  Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the following: 
A.  For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days; 
B.  For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days; 
C.  For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days; 
D.  For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days. 
(2)  A.  A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term. 
B.  1.  If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of the hearing. 
2.  If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the offender from the offender's jail sentence. 
(3)  If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the offender's participation in the county jail industry program. 
(4)  If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:

    The purpose of the stormwater management provision contained in this chapter and other related provisions contained elsewhere in the Code is to provide for effective management and financing of a stormwater system within the City of Gahanna. 
(a)  In order to accomplish the purpose of the effective administration of a stormwater system within the City of Gahanna, the chapter shall: 
(1)  Establish and maintain fair and reasonable stormwater management service charges for each lot or parcel in the City of Gahanna which bears a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities. Such service charges shall be charged because each property contributes to stormwater runoff and benefits from effective management of stormwater by the City of Gahanna. 
(2)  Ensure that similar properties pay similar stormwater management service charges which reflect the area of each property and its intensity of development, since these factors bear directly on the peak rate of stormwater runoff. 
Charges for residential properties (one dwelling unit) shall reflect the relatively uniform effect that such development has on runoff. Charges for all other properties shall be in proportion to residential properties, utilizing both relative area and intensity of development in setting rates. 
(3)  Provide a mechanism for consideration of specific or unusual service requirements of some properties, and special and general benefits accruing to or from properties as a result of providing their own stormwater management facilities. 
(4)  Provide for a service charge adjustment process to review stormwater charges when unusual circumstances exist which alter runoff characteristics, when either service or benefit varies from a normal condition or is of greater significance than contribution to runoff or to periodically ensure that rates reflect the current costs of effective stormwater management; and 
(5)  Utilize stormwater management funds throughout the City of Gahanna, except where activities or facilities are clearly unusual and in excess of the normal level of service Citywide and where developers are responsible for providing any new stormwater facilities required for their project. 
(b)  In order to maintain its effectiveness, this chapter shall: 
(1)  Establish a mechanism for appeals and amendments to its provisions. 
(2)  Provide a procedure for abatement of conditions or activities which are not in the interest of public health, safety or welfare. 
(3)  Provide for its continuous validity through severability of its various portions; and 
(4)  Provide penalties for violations of its provisions.

Prior to commencement of any initial Construction of Facilities in the Rights of Way a Construction Permittee, upon the reasonable request of the Director of Public Service, shall provide technical information about the proposed route of Construction. The technical information required may consist of completion of the following tasks: 
(1)  Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats, and other location data indicating the existence and approximate location of all Facilities along the proposed Construction route. 
(2)  Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any Facilities along the proposed Construction route, including, but not limited to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts, and visible street cut repairs. 
(3)  Determine and record the presence of and the approximate horizontal and vertical location of all Underground Facilities the Applicant or Person on whose behalf the Permit was applied for owns or controls in the Rights of Way along the proposed System route. Upon the reasonable request of the Director of Public Service, a Permittee shall also record and identify the general location of all other Facilities in the Rights of Way along the proposed System route. For the purposes of this Section, general location shall mean the alignment of other Facilities in the Rights of Way, but shall not necessarily mean the depth of other Facilities in the Rights of Way. 
(4)  If a Provider records the information requested above in an electronic format, the Provider shall provide the City with an electronic copy of the data obtained from completion of the tasks described in this section. Incorporation of the data required herein (931.18(a)(4)) by electronic means shall include only data for new Facilities that can be readily incorporated into the City's database. 
(5)  Where the proposed location of Facilities and the location of existing Underground Facilities appear to conflict with the plans as drafted, Construction Permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting Underground Facilities, or re-designing the Construction plans to eliminate the apparent conflict. A Construction Permittee shall not excavate more than a three foot by three foot square hole in the Rights of Way to complete this task. 
(6)  Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks described in this Section, adjust the proposed System design to avoid the need to relocate other Underground Facilities. 
(7)  All Confidential/Proprietary Information submitted herein shall be so labeled. 
(b)  Qualified Firm. All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to this Section 931.18 shall be performed by a firm specializing in utility engineering or may be performed by the Construction Permittee if the Construction Permittee is qualified to complete the project itself. 
(c)  Cost of Study. The Construction Permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with Sections 931.18(a) through 931.18(c) of this Chapter. 
(d)  Construction Schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in this Chapter, or unless the Director of Public Service waives any of the requirements of this Section due to unique or unusual circumstances, a Construction Permittee shall be required to submit a written Construction schedule to the City ten Working Days before commencing any work in or about the Rights of Way and, shall further notify the City not less than two Working Days in advance of any excavation in the Rights of Way. This Section shall apply to all situations with the exception of circumstances under Section 931.20(d)(1) (Emergency Situations). 
(e)  Location of Facilities. 
(1)  The placement of new Facilities and replacement of old Facilities, either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with applicable Laws. 
(2)  The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional Facilities within the Rights of Way if the Right of Way is Full. In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the Rights of Way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety, and welfare, the condition of the Rights of Way, the time of year, the protection of existing Facilities in the Rights of Way, future City and County plans for public improvements, development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest, and the nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral treatment of providers. 
(3)  Upon the concurrence of the City, or if it is determined by the Construction Permittee and such determination is reasonably based upon any appropriate local, state, or federal agency (or other entity with jurisdictional authority) that any existing poles in the Rights of Way are Full, then those poles may be replaced with bigger and/or taller poles in order to accommodate additional Facilities or Systems only after the Construction Permittee has made reasonable attempts to reach an acceptable solution without replacement with bigger and/or taller poles. This paragraph shall not apply to replacement of any existing pole(s) with identically sized pole(s) which results from the destruction of or hazardous condition of the existing pole(s) as long as no new Facilities or additional Facilities are attached. 
(f)  Least Disruptive Technology. All Construction or maintenance of Facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of damage and disruption of the Rights of Way. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable installed in the subsurface Rights of Way under this Chapter may be required, unless technologically impracticable, to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire or fiber optic cable may be installed under this Chapter using "direct bury" techniques. 
(g)  Relocation of Facilities. 
(1)  A Provider shall, at its own expense, permanently remove and relocate its Facilities in the Rights of Way whenever the City finds it necessary to request such removal and relocation. In instances where the City requests removal and/or relocation, the City shall waive all applicable Construction Permit Fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the Provider shall restore the Rights of Way to a condition at least as good as its condition immediately prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required to be removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with reasonably obtainable poles of the same or similar size unless otherwise permitted by the City. The Director of Public Service may request relocation and/or removal in order to prevent unreasonable interference by the Provider's Facilities with: 
A.  A public improvement undertaken or approved by the City or County; 
B.  When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the Rights of Way. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Provider who has Facilities in the Right of Way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the purposes of the City, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated portion or excess portion in conformity with O.R.C. 723.04.01. 
(3)  If, in the reasonable judgment of the City, a Provider fails to commence the removal process and/or relocation of its Facilities as designated by the City, within 30 days after the City's removal order is served upon Provider, or if a Provider fails to substantially complete such removal, including all associated repair of the Rights of Way of the City, within 12 months thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable Law, the City shall have the right to: 
A.  Declare that all rights, title and interest to the Facilities belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to, the right to connect and use the Facilities or to effect a transfer of all right, title and interest in the Facilities to another Person for operation; or 
B.  Authorize removal of the Facilities installed by the Provider in, on, over or under the Rights of Way of the City at Provider's cost and expense, by another Person, however the City shall have no liability for any damage caused by such action and the Provider shall be liable to the City for all reasonable costs incurred by the City in such action; and 
C.  To the extent consistent with applicable Law, any portion of the Provider's Facilities in, on, over or under the Rights of Way of the City designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the Provider shall belong to and become the property of the City without payment to the Provider, and the Provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the City shall request, in form and substance acceptable to the City, to evidence such ownership by the City. 
(h)  Pre-Excavation Facilities Location. Before the start date of any Rights of Way excavation, each Provider who has Facilities located in the area to be excavated shall be responsible to mark the horizontal and make every reasonable attempt using Best Efforts, to mark the approximate vertical placement of all its Facilities. All Providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of its Facilities and the best procedure for excavation. 
(i)  Rights of Way Restoration. 
(1)  The work to be done under the Permit, and the Restoration of the Rights of Way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the Permit. In addition to its own work, the Permittee must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the standards established by the Director of Public Service, subject to any applicable Laws. The Permittee must also inspect the area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the same condition for 12 months thereafter. 
(2)  In approving an Application for a Permit, the City may choose either to have the Permittee restore the Rights of Way or the City may restore the Rights of Way itself at the expense of the Permittee. 
(3)  If the City chooses to allow Permittee to restore the Rights of Way, Construction Permittee shall at the time of Application of a Construction Permit post a Construction Bond in an amount determined by the City to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the Rights of Way to condition at least as good as its condition immediately prior to Construction. If, 12 months after completion of the Restoration of the Rights of Way, the City determines that the Rights of Way have been properly restored, the surety on the Construction Bond shall be released. 
(4)  The Permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and with the materials specified and approved by the City. 
(5)  By restoring the Rights of Way itself, the Permittee guarantees its work and shall maintain it for 12 months following its completion. During this 12 month period, it shall, upon notification from the Department of Public Service and Engineering, correct all Restoration work to the extent necessary using the method required by the Department of Public Service and Engineering. Weather permitting, said work shall be completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the Department of Public Service and Engineering. 
(6)  If the Permittee fails to restore the Rights of Way in the manner and to the condition required by the City, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all repairs required by the City, the City, at its option, with notice to Provider and a reasonable time to cure, may do such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the City, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the Rights of Way and any other costs incurred by the City. Upon Failure to pay, the City may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by Permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies. 
(j)  Damage to Provider's Facilities and to Other Facilities. 
(1)  In the case of an Emergency, and if possible after reasonable efforts to contact the Provider seeking a timely response, when the City performs work in the Rights of Way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a Provider's Facilities to protect those Facilities, the costs associated therewith will be billed to that Provider and shall be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the City may pursue all legal and equitable remedies in the event a Provider does not pay or the City may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by Permittee and pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies. 
(2)  Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any Facilities in the Rights of Way which it or its Facilities damage. Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the Facilities of another Provider caused during the City's response to an Emergency caused by such Provider's Facilities. 
(k)  Rights of Way Vacation. If the City vacates a Rights of Way which contains the Facilities of a Provider, such vacation shall be subject to the provisions of O.R.C.  723.04.1. 
(l)  Installation Requirements. The excavation, backfilling, Restoration, and all other work performed in the Rights of Way shall be performed in conformance with all applicable Laws and the standards as promulgated by the Director of Public Service. 
(m)  Inspection. 
(1)  When the Construction under any Permit hereunder is completed, the Permittee shall notify the Department of Public Service and Engineering. 
(2)  The Permittee shall make the Construction site available to the Inspector and to all others as authorized by Law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the Construction. 
(3)  At any time, including the time of inspection, the Inspector may order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the public, violates any Law, or which violates the terms and conditions of the Permit and/or this Chapter. 
(4)  The Inspector may issue an order to correct work which does not conform to the Permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the Permit. The order may be served on the Permittee as provided in Section 931.23(d). An order may be appealed to the Director of Public Service. The decision of the Director of Public Service may be appealed to the BZBA whose decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten days after issuance of the order, the Provider shall present proof to the Director of Public Service that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the Director of Public Service may revoke the Permit pursuant to Section 931.20(e). 
(n)  Other Obligations. Obtaining a Construction Permit does not relieve Permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary Permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees, including on site inspection fees, required by the City, or any other City, county, state, or federal Laws. 
(1)  A Permittee shall comply with all requirements of Laws, including the requirements of the Ohio Utility Protection Service (OUPS) and/or its lawful successor. 
(2)  A Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable Laws and standards and is responsible for all work done in the Rights of Way pursuant to its Permit, regardless of who performs the work. 
(3)  No rights of Way obstruction or excavation may be performed when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except in the case of an Emergency as outlined in Section 931.20(d)(1). 
(4)  A Permittee shall not so obstruct a Rights of Way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. 
(5)  Private vehicles other than necessary Construction vehicles may not be parked within or adjacent to a Permit area. The loading or unloading of trucks adjacent to a Permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Permit. 
(o)  Undergrounding Required. Any owner of property abutting upon a street or alley where Service Facilities are now located underground and where the Service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to install underground any Service delivery infrastructure from the property line to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such Service is supplied.

(Ord. 94-2001. Passed 5-7-01.) 
931.20 - ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION. 
(a)  Mandatory Denial of Permit. Except in the case of an Emergency, no Construction Permit will be granted: 
(1)  To any Person who has not yet made an Application if such Application is required pursuant to this Chapter or the Codified Ordinances; or 
(2)  To any Person or their agent who has outstanding debt owed to the City; or 
(3)  To any Person or their agent as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of a Permit; or 
(4)  If, in the discretion of the Director of Public Service, the issuance of a Permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The Director of Public Service, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the Rights of Way, and by considerations relating to the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(b)  Permissive Denial. The Director of Public Service may deny a Permit in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the Rights of Way, or when necessary to protect the Rights of Way and its users. The Director of Public Service, in his or her discretion, may consider one or more of the following factors: the extent to which Rights of Way space where the Permit is sought is available; the competing demands for the particular space in the Rights of Way; the availability of other locations in the Rights of Way or in other Rights of Way for the proposed Facilities; the applicability of this Chapter or other regulations of the Rights of Way that affect location of Facilities in the Rights of Way; the degree of compliance of the Provider with the terms and conditions of this Chapter and its requirements, and other applicable ordinances and regulations; the degree of disruption to surrounding communities and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the Rights of Way; the condition and age of the Rights of Way, and whether and when it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; the balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage to the Rights of Way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional parts of the Rights of Way; and whether such Applicant or their agent has failed within the past three years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance, with the requirements of this Chapter or, if applicable, any other Chapters of the Codified Ordinances, or any other applicable Law. 
(c)  Discretionary Issuance. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section's 931.20(a)(1) and 931.20(a)(2), the Director of Public Service may issue a Permit in any case where the Permit is necessary: 
(1)  To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the Permit applicant if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the City; 
(2)  To allow such customer to materially improve its Service; or 
(3)  To allow a new economic development project. To be granted a Permit under this Section, the Permit Applicant must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of Service, or the development project at the time it was required to submit its list of next year projects. 
(d)  Work Done Without a Permit. 
(1)  Emergency Situations. Each Provider shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify the Director of Public Service of any event regarding its Facilities which it considers to be an Emergency. The Provider may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the Emergency. Within two business days, unless otherwise extended by the Director of Public Service, after the occurrence or discovery of the Emergency (whichever is later), the Provider shall apply for the necessary Permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill all the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this Chapter for any and all actions taken in response to the Emergency. 
    In the event that the City becomes aware of an Emergency regarding a Provider 's Facilities, the City may attempt to contact the Provider or System Representative of each Provider affected, or potentially affected, by the Emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond to the Emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the Provider whose Facilities caused the Emergency. 
(2)  Non-Emergency Situations. Except in the case of an Emergency, any Provider who Constructs in, on, above, within, over, below or through a Right of Way without a valid Permit shall subsequently obtain a Permit, pay double the normal fee for said Permit, pay double all the other fees required by the Codified Ordinances, deposit with the City the fees necessary to correct any damage to the Rights of Way and comply with all of the requirements of this Chapter. 
(e)  Revocation of Permits. 
(1)  Permittees hold Permits issued pursuant to the Codified Ordinances as a privilege and not as a right. The City reserves the right, as provided herein, to revoke any Permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any Law or any provision or condition of the Permit. A substantial breach by Permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
A.  The violation of any provision or condition of the Permit; or 
B.  An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the Permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the City or its citizens; or 
C.  Any material misrepresentation of fact in the Application for a Permit; or 
D.  The Failure to obtain and/or maintain required Construction or Removal Bonds and/or insurance; or 
E.  The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a Certificate of Registration; or 
F.  The failure to complete Construction in a timely manner; or 
G.  The failure to correct any nonconformity as ordered pursuant to Section 931.18(m)(4). 
(2)  If the Director of Public Service determines that the Permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any Law or any provision or condition of the Permit, the Director of Public Service shall serve a written demand upon the Permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the Permit. Upon, a substantial breach, as stated above, the Director of Public Service may place additional or revised conditions on the Permit. 
(3)  By the close of the next business day following receipt of notification of the breach, Permittee shall contact the Director of Public Service with a plan, acceptable to the Director of Public Service, for its correction. Permittee's failure to so contact the Director of Public Service, or the Permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or Permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the Permit. 
(4)  From time to time, the Director of Public Service may establish a list of standard conditions for the Permit. A substantial breach of any condition shall also constitute an unauthorized use of the public Rights of Way as defined in Section 931.14. 
(5)  If a Permittee commits a second substantial breach as outlined above, Permittee's Permit will automatically be revoked and not be allowed further Permits for one full year, except for Emergency repairs. 
(6)  If a Permit is revoked, the Permittee shall also reimburse the City for the City's reasonable costs, including Restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such revocation. 
(Ord. 94-2001. Passed 5-7-01.) 
931.21 - CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS. 
(a)  Construction Bond.

The Director of Public Service shall make all reasonable efforts to allow Provider a period of five business days after serving notification to correct or repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to Director of Public Service's attachment of letter of credit or surety bond regarding the removal of Facilities. Upon attachment, written notice shall be provided to the Provider by the Director of Public Service. 
(c)  Blanket Bond. In lieu of the Construction Bond required by Section 931.21(a) and the Removal Bond required by Section 931.21(b), Provider may deposit with the Director of Public Service, in a form acceptable to the Director of Law, an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond in the amount of $5,000,000.00.

(7)  The payment of any other amounts which become due to the City pursuant to this Chapter or other Law. 
(f)  Form. The bond documents required by this Section, and any replacement bond documents shall, contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled or not renewed by the surety nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the surety until 90 days after completion of Construction of the Facilities and, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or not renewed by the surety until at least 90 days' written notice to City of surety's intention to cancel or not renew this bond." 
(Ord. 94-2001. Passed 5-7-01.) 
931.22 - INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY. 
(a)  City Does Not Accept Liability. By reason of the acceptance of an Application or the grant of a Permit, the City does not assume any liability: 
(1)  For injuries to Persons, damage to property, or loss of Service claims; or 
(2)  For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the installation, presence, maintenance, or operation of Facilities. 
(b)  Indemnification. By applying for and being issued a Certificate of Registration with the City a Provider agrees, or by accepting a Permit a Permittee is required and agrees, to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the City's agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors from all costs, liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of any kind arising out of the Construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair, replacement, Restoration, or operation of its Facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a Right of Way, whether any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by a Permit. A Provider or Permittee further agrees that it will not bring, nor cause to be brought, any action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other relief against the City's agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors for any claim nor for any award arising out of the presence, installation, maintenance or operation of its Facilities, or any activity undertaken in or near a Right of Way, whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a Permit. This Section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the Provider, Permittee, or to the City; and the Provider or Permittee, in defending any action on behalf of the City, if allowable by Law, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf. Any and all exercise of the above shall be consistent with, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  To the fullest extent permitted by Law, all Providers and Permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits, claims (including without limitation Worker's Compensation claims against the City or others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or damages including but not limited to expenses for reasonable legal fees and disbursements assumed by the City in connection therewith: 
A.

Should the amount of such deposit be insufficient to pay the cost thereof, the owner or developer shall immediately, upon demand, deposit such additional sums as are estimated by the Director of Finance to be necessary. Upon completion and acceptance of the improvement, any unexpended balance remaining from such deposits shall be refunded. 
    The owner or developer shall hold the City free and harmless from any and all claims for damages of every nature arising or growing out of the construction of such improvements, and shall defend, at his or their own cost and expense, each and every suit or action brought against the City by reason thereof, until the improvement has been accepted by the City and the developer notified in writing within 30 days.

1109.07 - DRAINAGE. 
(a)  General. The Planning Commission shall not approve any subdivision having inadequate storm drainage or other physical drainage impairment, as determined by the City Engineer. In areas known to be subject to periodic floods, such drainage improvements must be made as to satisfy the aforementioned public officers, in order that the safety, health and welfare of the people will be protected. 
(b)  Protection of Drainage Courses. No natural drainage course shall be altered and no fill, buildings or structures shall be placed in it, unless provisions are made for the flow of water in a manner satisfactory to the City Engineer. An easement shall be provided on both sides of any existing important surface drainage course adequate for the purpose of protecting, widening, deepening, enclosing or otherwise improving such stream for drainage purposes. 
(c)  Lot Drainage. A master grade plan shall be prepared for all subdivisions and shall be presented to the City Engineer for review and approval. The grading plan shall show the existing topography, the proposed street grades and the proposed storm sewers with pipe sizes and grades. It shall also show the proposed elevation at each lot corner, the proposed finish grades at the house and shall delineate the method of rear yard drainage by showing proposed swales and direction of surface slope by arrows. The grading plan shall follow the standards established for such grading by the Federal Housing Administration. 
    Wherever possible, with exceptions being made where the topography of an area does not permit such grading practice, lots shall be graded from the rear lot line to the street. Where a lot abuts directly on two streets, the grade shall be from the corner of the lot which is diagonally opposed to the corner of the two streets on which the lot abuts. This regulation is included in a desire to reduce the amount of water standing in yards to a minimum. Therefore, where it is not possible to grade a lot in the prescribed manner, the owner or developer shall provide for the adequate drainage of any and all low areas and tie such drainage into and make it a part of the storm sewer system of the development and the City, as directed by the City Engineer, with approval of such drainage subject to inspection by the Engineer along with the inspection of other storm sewer installations. (Ord 50-61. Passed 11-20-61) 
(d)  Gutters and Downspouts. All buildings and structures or appurtenances thereto erected within the City shall be provided with gutters and downspouts for the purpose of collecting and channeling roof water from such buildings and structures. 
(e)  Conductors into Gutters, Storm Sewers. All water from sumps, sump pumps, gutters or downspouts, which water would flow by gravity over a public sidewalk or over adjacent property, shall be carried, by means of conductors, away from such adjacent property, beneath the sidewalk and through the curb outlets provided, into the gutter or storm sewer. If the curb outlets provided are not used or are not sufficient in number, any curb cuts made shall be drilled. (Ord. 12-68. Passed 2-5-68.) 
(f)  Garage Construction. Except upon written approval of the Director of Public Service, garage floors shall not be constructed less than 12 inches above the top of the curb elevation.

1109.08 - PUBLIC AREAS. 
(a)  Purpose. The City of Gahanna recognizes it is essential to the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of Gahanna and persons working in Gahanna, that the character and quality of the environment be considered of major importance in the planning and the development of the City. In this regard, the manner in which land is developed and used is of high priority. The preservation of land for park, playground, and public open space purposes as it relates to the use and development of land for residential, commercial/industrial purposes is essential to maintain a healthful and desirable environment for all citizens of the City. The City must not only provide these necessary amenities for our citizens today, but also be insightful to the needs of future citizens. 
(1)  It is recognized by the City of Gahanna that the demand for park, playground, and public open space within a City is directly related to the density and intensity of development permitted and allowed within any given area. 
(2)  This section is provided to assist land developers in understanding the procedures used to establish park land dedication and/or fees. 
(b)  Land Dedication. 
(1)  In every case where land is to be developed for residential use, the developer, as a prerequisite to the approval of the final plat or multiple family residential zoning change application, must convey or dedicate to the City of Gahanna a reasonable amount of the land to be subdivided for public use as parks, recreational facilities, trails, or wetlands. A subdivision without plat shall not be required to follow this section. A multiple family residential development shall be required to meet these requirements during the zoning change application process. The amount and type of land to be dedicated is determined through a process defined by this section of code. This is only a minimum, and the Gahanna City Council has the discretion to increase the amount of land to be so conveyed or dedicated based on the anticipated needs of the City that the proposed development will bring about. 
(2)  The City will have the option to require a developer to contribute an equivalent amount in cash based on the fair market value of the undeveloped land, within the proposed development at the time of approval of the final plat, or multiple family residential zoning, and such contribution will be in lieu of conveyance or dedication of land for public uses. Such cash payments will be placed in a special fund by the City and used only for the acquisition of land for parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, or development of existing park and playground sites. 
(c)  Staff Evaluation of Land Dedication. The mandatory land dedication shall be evaluated by the appropriate City staff to determine whether such dedication is acceptable as appropriate sites for parks and recreational facilities. A three-tier process is to be used by the City in evaluating the proposed land dedication. A written report for each assessment shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission and the Clerk of Council with the application. 
(1)  Needs assessment. An analysis shall be made to determine the estimated park, and recreation need that will be created by each proposed development. This analysis shall be prepared by the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee and conducted by the following process: 
A.  The amount of public parkland dedication required in a proposed development shall be a minimum of 0.5 acres and computed as follows: 
1.  Residential population in single-family detached or attached units will be estimated by multiplying the number of proposed dwelling units by 2.99 persons per household; 
2.  Residential population in multi family units will be estimated by multiplying the number of proposed dwelling units by 1.615 persons per household: 
3.  Public parkland per individual: in determining the space required for public parkland in a proposed development, it shall require that .025 acres be dedicated per individual proposed to be housed in the new development based on the assumptions contained in paragraph 1 or 2 above. 
4.  Calculation for required public parkland dedication for each development. 
a.  For single-family detached or attached units intended for individual ownership, the following formula shall be utilized: 
(Number of lots) x (2.99 individuals/lot) x (.025 acres/individual) = dedicated acres. 
b.  For multi family developments generally intended for rental, the following formula should be utilized: 
(Number of units) x (1.615 individuals/unit) x (.025 acres/individual) = dedicated acres. 
5.  The amount of public parkland required to be dedicated shall be capped and not to exceed 25% of the total number of acres being developed. 
(2)  Technical assessment. The following suitability and quality criteria shall be used to provide a technical assessment and recommendation relative to the appropriateness of proposed park, recreational and open space areas. The criteria to be used for this determination shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
A.  Suitability of soils and geology for the proposed use; 
B.  Suitability of topography and drainage for the proposed use; 
C.  Location and impact of federally-designated floodways and floodway fringe areas relative to the proposed use; 
D.  Extent of natural vegetation and tree cover, with the preservation of wooded areas a priority; 
E.  The adequacy of the distribution of proposed areas within the proposed subdivision; 
F.  The adequacy of the configuration of each proposed area; and 
G.  The degree and quality of access to areas for pedestrians and vehicles, where appropriate. 
The Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee and Director of Parks and Recreation shall conduct this technical review of the proposed land dedication areas using the above cited criteria. Each shall forward a separate written report, with recommendations, to the Planning Commission with the application. 
(3)  Policy assessment. The proposed land dedications shall be reviewed and compared with currently adopted policies, adopted plans, on-going programs and technical projections to determine the appropriateness of each proposed land dedication. The Parks and Recreation Board and the Director of Parks and Recreation shall each forward a separate written report, with recommendations, to the Planning Commission. 
The criteria to be used for this assessment shall include, but not be limited to the following. 
A.  Land proposed to be dedicated for public purposes shall meet identified needs of the City as contained in the current parks and recreation Comprehensive Master Plan. 
B.  To be eligible for park dedication credit, land dedicated is to be located outside of drain ways, floodplains or ponding areas. 
C.  The dedicated public parkland may include waterways and ponds, provided the area of such waterways and ponds is not used to satisfy the amount of public parkland required in paragraph A. of this section. 
(d)  Review and Approval Process. Upon the filing and acceptance of an application for preliminary plat approval, the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee, shall initiate the staff evaluation procedure required under subsection (b) hereof, by forwarding a copy of the application, preliminary plat and other submitted documents, the Parks and Recreation Board and the Director of Parks and Recreation. Written assessment reports shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission and the Clerk of Council within 30 days of the filing and acceptance of the preliminary plat application. If the Parks and Recreation Board, Director of Parks and Recreation, Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee fails to file a written report within the 30 day period, such failure shall constitute a recommendation of approval of the developer's land dedication proposal. 
    The Planning Commission shall consider the preliminary plat, and the assessment reports from the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee, the Director of Parks and Recreation, and the Parks and Recreation Board, and render a decision to approve or deny such preliminary plat and parkland dedication within 30 days of receipt of the assessment reports. 
    All standards and requirements under Section 1105.02 and 1105.03 shall apply, except where superseded by this section. 
    Nothing in this section shall preclude a developer from presenting the land dedication proposals at the pre-application stage, pursuant to Section 1105.01, and for the informal review of such land dedication with the Planning Commission and City Officials prior to submission of an application for preliminary plat approval. 
    Approval of a preliminary plat shall be valid for a period of 12 months, pursuant to Section 1105.03(g). 
    The owner of land proposed to be subdivided shall submit an application for final plat approval pursuant to Section 1105.04, wherein the land dedication details shall be presented. Such final plat, including the land dedication arrangement, as approved by the Planning Commission as part of the preliminary plat approval, shall be reviewed in accordance with the procedures under Section 1105.05. 
    Nothing contained within this section shall preclude Council from accepting a portion of the developer's proposed land dedication and requiring fees-in-lieu of dedication for the remainder of the proposed dedication. 
    Mandatory land dedications may be waived by Council when Council has adopted a motion resolution establishing a priority for the payment of in-lieu fees, instead of accepting land dedications during a specified period of time. Such in-lieu fees, as stated in this motion, shall be designated for a specific community-wide park, recreational or open space project, as stated in the motion, and placed in a specially designated fund, to be titled in the motion. Such community-wide project shall benefit the current and future residents of any platted subdivision of which the developer has expended in-lieu fees under this motion. 
    Nothing in this section or any other section shall preclude developers from transferring to the City land dedications for park, recreational sites or expending in-lieu fees in excess of the mandatory requirements of this section. 
(e)  Fees for Unacceptable Dedication. Proposed land dedication areas that are not acceptable to the City, as determined by the Planning Commission and Council, as sites for parks and recreational facilities, shall not be dedicated to the City and fees-in-lieu of dedication shall be paid in place of the dedication. 
    Proposed dedicated land areas shall be determined to be unacceptable to the City, based upon the assessment reports, and Planning Commission action, on an application for preliminary plat approval or zoning change. The unacceptability of land dedications may also be determined during the final plat approval process if unknown or changing circumstances have impacted the approved preliminary plat. At the time of preliminary plat approval, or at the time of final plat approval, the developer shall be instructed that a fee shall be required in lieu of any portion of the land dedication. 
(f)  Calculation of Fees In-Lieu of Land Dedication. A fee-in-lieu of land dedication shall be paid to the City for any land area that is not acceptable as a site for open space, parks and recreational facilities. 
    The in-lieu fees shall be based upon the average value per acre of the total gross site prior to construction or improvement of the proposed development for which an application for preliminary plat approval has been submitted. To calculate this estimate, the total value should be based on the fair market value of the underlying land, as determined by an appraisal. The appraisal shall be conducted, completed and submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee prior to final plat approval. The appraisal shall be prepared by a certified appraiser selected and paid for by the developer. Two paper copies and one digital copy are required to be submitted. 
(g)  Use and Deposit of In-Lieu Fees. The City of Gahanna will maintain a separate fund into which all cash contributions received from owners or developers in lieu of conveyance or dedication of land for public use as parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, or open space will be deposited and will make, from time to time, appropriations from such fund for acquisition of land for such purposes and uses, for developing existing parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, or wetlands. 
(h)  Area conveyed or dedicated hereunder may not be included by a developer as an allowance for purposes of calculating the density requirements of the development. 
(i)  Acceptance of Land Dedications and Fees In-Lieu of Land Dedications. Council shall not accept land dedications and/or payment of in-lieu fees required under this section until the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee has certified in writing that all required land dedication and fee payment requirements have been met by the developer as approved as a part of final plat requirements and/or part of the zoning change process with an MFRD zoning application. The land dedication and payment of in-lieu fees required by this section shall be conveyed to the City following approval by Council for the final plat or multiple family residential zoning application, and within 60 days of receiving notice of such approval by Council. 
(j)  Terms and Conditions. 
(1)  The removal of trees, topsoil, storage of construction equipment, burying of construction debris, or stockpiling of surplus is strictly forbidden on parkland to be dedicated without the written approval of the Director of Parks and Recreation. 
(2)  Neither a zoning certificate nor a building permit for construction or improvements of any kind shall be issued by the City for the subject development or property until such land dedications or payment of fees-in-lieu of land dedications are conveyed to and accepted by the City. 
(3)  Grading and utility plan, which may affect or impact the proposed parkland dedication, shall be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer and the Director of Parks and Recreation prior to dedication, or at such time as reasonably determined. 
(4)  Prior to dedication for public purpose, the developer shall deliver to the City Attorney, an abstract of title or registered property abstract for such dedication. Such title shall vest in the City good and marketable title, free and clear of any mortgages, liens, encumbrances, assessments and taxes. The conveyance documents shall be in such form acceptable to the City. 
(k)  Park Fee. A park fee shall be paid to the City by the developer in the case of platted residential subdivisions. 
    Such park fee shall be as established in the Building and Zoning Fee Schedule set forth in Section 135.10 in Part One of these Codified Ordinances. Such fee shall be collected prior to the issuance of building permits and deposited in a special fund entitled Park Fund.

Such buffer zone shall be at least 15 feet adjacent to all common boundaries except street frontage and shall include one tree for each 40 feet of linear boundary, or fraction thereof, and a continuous six-foot-high planting, hedge, fence, wall or earth mound. 
(21)  Under PRCD, the development shall incorporate at least 40 perfect of the gross floor area of the structure(s) as residential usage. The PRCD District shall allow the integration of commercial and residential uses, but shall maintain a degree of residential ambiance.

(4)  The Planning Commission may take no action whatever until such time as all required papers and documents are submitted to it, with the application and fee therefor. 
(5)  All plans, papers, documents, maps, studies and fees required to be submitted with the application, and the application itself, shall become the property of the City and will not be returned to the applicant, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. 
(f)  Planning Commission Action. Upon the submission of the application, required papers, maps and documents accompanying the same and the fee to the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee, the Planning Commission shall, at its next regularly scheduled meeting, schedule a public hearing on such application and Outline Development Plan, such hearing to be held not later than 60 days after the date that it is scheduled. At such hearing, the applicant or his representative shall present a statement and adequate and sufficient evidence in such form as the Planning Commission may require, to aid the Planning Commission in its deliberation on the application and the Outline Development Plan. Before approving an application for zoning or rezoning to a PUD District, the Planning Commission shall decide: 
(1)  That the proposed development is consistent in all respects with the purpose, intent and applicable standards of this chapter, and the general zoning, building, subdivision and other pertinent ordinances of the City. 
(2)  That the proposed development is in conformity with a comprehensive Plan, or portion thereof, as the same may apply to the tract in question. 
(3)  That the proposed development is not detrimental to the general welfare of the inhabitants of the City. 
(4)  That the benefits, improved arrangement and the general design of the proposed development justify the deviation from other districts, as included in the Zoning Ordinance. 
(g)  Publication of Notice and Posting of Property. 
(1)  Before approving or denying the application before it, the Planning Commission shall hold at least one public hearing on such application, notice of which shall include place, time, date and nature of such applied for in a newspaper of general circulation in the City twice during the two weeks prior to the public hearing. 
Written notice of said hearing shall also be mailed by ordinary mail to the street addresses of contiguous property owners of the property for which said hearing is being held. The failure of delivery of such notice shall not invalidate any such application. The names and addresses of all property owners entitled to notice of the public hearing shall be furnished by the applicant. 
Where the subject of such public hearing involves 50 or more of the property owners of the City, then written notice to owners of the hearing, as provided in the preceding paragraph, shall not be required. 
(2)  Drawings and related written materials which fully describe the design concept and platting of the proposed planned unit development shall be filed by the applicant with the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee prior to publication of the first notice of public hearing and shall be available for review and study by the general public until the time of such public hearing. 
(3)  Not less than 14 days prior to the scheduled date of public hearing, the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee shall cause the property in question to be posted with a zoning notice stating the time and place of the scheduled public hearing, the identity of the applicant, the present zoning of the property and the requested zoning. 
(h)  Council Action. 
(1)  Within 45 days after the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall forward the application and supporting matter, including the Outline Development Plan to Council, along with a written report recommending that the application and Outline Development Plan be approved, approved with modifications or disapproved. The report shall contain the findings of the Planning Commission as to conformity to criteria set forth in 1151.15(e)(2) and the reasons for whatever recommendation is made to Council by the Planning Commission. In the event that the Planning Commission fails to forward its report within 45 days after the public hearing, such failure shall be deemed to be an approval of the application and the Outline Development Plan, and it shall be forwarded automatically to Council as if it had been approved by the Planning Commission. 
(2)  At the next regularly scheduled Council meeting, the President of Council shall schedule a public hearing upon the application and Outline Development Plan, as submitted to Council by the Planning Commission. Not less than 30 days prior to the date scheduled for the public hearing by Council, the Clerk of Council shall cause notice of such hearing to be given in accordance with the Zoning Ordinance and the provisions of Article XI of the Charter. 
(3)  In the event the application and Outline Development Plan is approved by Council, Council shall cause the Zoning Map to be amended by ordinance to reflect the change to the PUD District. If the application and Outline Development Plan is approved with modifications by Council, Council shall not amend the Zoning Map until the applicant has filed with Council a written consent to the plan as modified. Such written consent must be filed with the Clerk of Council within 60 days after Council's action upon the application and Outline Development Plan. In the event such a written consent is not filed within 60 days, such failure shall be deemed a refusal to consent to the modifications and the application and Outline Development Plan shall be conclusively presumed to have been denied by Council. In the event such written consent to the application and Outline Development Plan as modified is filed, Council shall then cause the Zoning Map to be changed by ordinance to reflect the PUD District. 
(i)  Effect of Approval of Application, Outline Development Plan. 
(1)  Within two years after the approval of the application to amend the Zoning Map by Council, the applicant shall be required to submit a plat of the PUD District or a partial plat of the PUD District, to contain not less than 25 acres, but if the entire PUD District so applied for, is more than 50 acres, not less than 50 acres may be submitted as a plat, unless the entire balance of the PUD District is less than fifty acres, in which case the entire balance shall be submitted. Such plat is to be submitted in accordance with all the applicable laws, ordinances and regulations of the City. 
(2)  In the event that a partial plat is submitted and recorded within the two-year period the approval of the PUD District shall be continued so long as a plat containing not less than 50 acres within the PUD District is submitted (unless the entire remainder of the PUD District consists of less than 50 acres, in which case the entire remainder of such PUD District must be submitted as a plat) and recorded within a two-year period from the time of the last recording of the plat or partial plat. In the event that a plat, partial plat or a subsequent partial plat is not submitted and recorded within the above time limits, the approval of the PUD District shall be automatically voided, without action by Council, and the land shall revert to its last previous zoning district. However, Council may, in its discretion and for good cause shown by the applicant, grant a time extension, not to exceed six months in length, for the submission and recording of a subsequent plat or partial plat. 
(j)  Plat and Development Plan. No building or construction may be commenced within any PUD District after approval, until the Plat and Development Plan has been approved by the Planning Commission under the following procedures: 
    The applicant shall file with the Planning Commission, within the acreage limits and the time limits set forth in Section 1151.15(i), a Plat and Development Plan containing, in final form, the following information with respect to that area to be platted and developed:

(2)  Areas proposed to be conveyed, dedicated or reserved for parks, parkways, playgrounds, school sites, public buildings and other similar public and semipublic places. 
(3)  A development schedule indicating the approximate date when development of the project can be expected to begin; the stages in which the project will be developed and the approximate date when development of each stage can be expected to begin; the anticipated rate of development, the approximate dates when each of the stages of the development will be completed, and the area location of common open space that will be provided at each stage of the development. 
(4)  Agreements, provisions or covenants which govern the use, maintenance and continued protection of the planned development and any of its common open areas. 
(5)  Fees as required in Section 1151.15 (o)(2). 
(k)  Submission of Plat, Development Plan; Planning Commission Action. The Planning Commission shall, within 30 days after the submission of a Plat and Development Plan, give its written approval of such Plat and Development Plan so long as it is consistent and in conformity with the Outline Development Plan and the standards of this chapter. Such approval shall be granted by the Planning Commission so long as the Plat and Development Plan are in conformity with the Outline Development Plan, and shall not be withheld unless the Planning Commission deems that there is a substantial variation from the Outline Development Plan. 
(l)  Variation From Outline Development Plan; Procedure. 
(1)  Should the Planning Commission, at any regular meeting or at any special meeting called for the purpose of considering the submission of a Plat and Development Plan, find that a substantial variation exists between the Plat and Development Plan, as submitted, and the Outline Development Plan, the Chair of the Planning Commission shall forthwith notify the applicant that a substantial variation is deemed to exist and the particulars thereof. The applicant may, within 30 days of receipt of such notification, elect, either to amend the Plat and Development Plan to eliminate such substantial variation and resubmit such amended Plat and Development Plan without further fee, or to request the Chair of the Planning Commission to appoint a Fact-Finding Board, as hereinafter provided. Such election of the applicant shall be in writing to the Chair of the Planning Commission. Should the applicant fail to make such election within the time limit provided herein, the Plat and Development Plan shall be conclusively presumed to have been denied and no further action or appeal may be taken thereon. 
(2)  Should the applicant elect to submit the dispute to a Fact-Finding Board, the Chair of the Planning Commission shall forthwith appoint two members of the Planning Commission to a Fact-Finding Board. Such Board shall be composed of two members of Council, the above-mentioned two members of the Planning Commission and one freeholder-elector of the City who has no direct or indirect financial interest in the matter. Such freeholder-elector shall be appointed by the Mayor, who shall attest to his qualifications, and the City Attorney. The Chair shall forthwith notify the President of Council that the Planning Commission deems that a substantial variation from the Outline Development Plan exists. The President of Council shall appoint two members of Council and shall designate one of such members as the Chair of the Fact-Finding Board. The City Attorney shall have no vote on such Board and shall act in an advisory capacity. 
(3)  The Fact-Finding Board shall meet within fifteen days after the appointment of the Chair thereof. The applicant shall be notified of such meeting and shall be present to submit detailed information concerning the reasons for the variation as found by the Planning Commission. The Board shall report its findings, in writing, within 20 days after the appointment of the Chair thereof, to the Chair of the Planning Commission. Should the Board fail to meet within the fifteen-day time limit set forth herein or should the Board fail to notify the Chair of the Planning Commission of its findings within the 20-day period set forth herein, such failure shall be construed as a positive recommendation to the Planning Commission that the variation as found by the Planning Commission is justified as being due to unforeseeable or changed circumstances and not due to the negligence of the applicant. Should the applicant fail to appear, after proper notification of the Board meeting, to present his reasons, either in person or through his representative as to the reason for the variation, such failure shall be conclusively presumed to be a withdrawal by the applicant of the Plat and Development Plan from consideration by the Planning Commission, and the submission of such Plat and Development Plan shall be considered void and of no effect and does not toll the time limits set forth in 1151.15 (i) for the submission of Plat and Development Plans. 
(4)  After submission of the information to the Board by the applicant, such Board shall determine only: 
A.  Whether the substantial variation from the Outline Development Plan, as found by the Planning Commission, is justified by circumstances which have changed since the original submission of the Outline Development Plan and which could not have reasonably been foreseen by the applicant at the time of, or prior to the submission of the Outline Development Plan, and that the variation, as found is in no way due to the negligence or lack of diligence on the part of the applicant; or 
B.  The variation is unjustified and could have been foreseen by the applicant by the use of reasonable diligence at the time of, or prior to the submission of the Outline Development Plan. 
(5)  At its next regular meeting or at a special meeting called for such purpose, after receipt of the recommendation of the Fact-Finding Board, the Planning Commission shall act on the Plat and Development Plan as submitted by the applicant. The Planning Commission shall in no way be bound by the recommendation of the Fact-Finding Board, but if the recommendation of the Board is that the variation is justified, and the Planning Commission disapproves such variation as being unjustified, such disapproval shall act to toll the time limits set forth in Section 1151.15(i), pending appeal by the applicant, as set forth in Section 1151.15(n). 
(m)  Procedure Upon Approval by Planning Commission. In the event the Plat and Development Plan is approved by the Planning Commission, under the same criteria as defined in Section 1151.15(f), such Plat and Development Plan shall be submitted to Council for approval in the same manner and under the same procedure as that prescribed in the Subdivision Ordinance (Title One of this Part Eleven - Planning and Zoning Code) and amendments thereto. 
(n)  Procedure Upon Disapproval by Planning Commission. 
(1)  In the event that the Planning Commission has received the recommendation of a justifiable variation from the Fact-Finding Board as set forth in Section 1151.15(l), but the Planning Commission has disapproved such Plat and Development Plan, an appeal may be taken by the applicant to the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals in the form, manner and time set forth in Section 12.03 of the Charter. Should the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals find that the Planning Commission should have approved such Plat and Development Plan, in accordance with the recommendation of the Fact-Finding Board, the Plat and Development Plan shall be considered automatically approved by the Planning Commission and submitted to Council in the manner prescribed in Section 1151.15(m). Should the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals disapprove such Plat and Development Plan, the applicant shall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies. 
(2)  In the event the Fact-Finding Board has recommended to the Planning Commission that the variation of the Plat and Development Plan from the Outline Development Plan is unjustified, and the Planning Commission has disapproved such Plat and Development Plan and an appeal has been taken to the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals under subsection (n)(1) hereof, and the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals has recommended approval of such Plat and Development Plan, then the City Attorney shall within 20 days of the date of the decision of the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals, file a written appeal to Council. Such appeal shall be set for hearing before Council at the next regular meeting to be held more than ten days after the mailing of the notice of appeal and shall be heard at that time, unless a written extension of time is granted to either party by the President of Council. A copy of the notice of appeal shall be sent to the applicant and to the Chair of the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals and at least five days' written notice shall be given to the applicant and the Chair of the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals of the date, time and place of the hearing. At such hearing before Council, the City Attorney shall represent the Chair of the Planning Commission or his appointed representative and the Board of Zoning Appeals may be represented by any member thereof. The applicant may represent himself or may appoint his representative. The findings and decision of Council shall be final. 
(3)  In the event the Fact-Finding Board has recommended to the Planning Commission that the variation of the Plat and Development Plan from the Outline Development Plan is unjustified, and the Planning Commission approves such Plat and Development Plan, the City Attorney shall, within 20 days of the date of the decision of the Planning Commission, file a written appeal to Council. Such appeal shall be set for hearing before Council at the next regular meeting to be held more than ten days after the mailing of the notice of appeal and shall be heard at that time unless a written extension of time is granted to any interested party by the President of Council. A copy of the notice of appeal shall be sent to the applicant and to the Chair of the Planning Commission, and, at least five days' written notice shall be given to the applicant and the Chair of the Planning Commission of the date, time and place of the hearing. The City Attorney shall represent the Chair of the Fact-Finding Board and the Planning Commission may be represented by any member thereof. The applicant shall represent himself or may appoint his representative. The findings and decision of Council shall be final and such appeal to Council shall be deemed to have been a submission to Council under the Subdivision Ordinance (Title One of this Part Eleven-Planning and Zoning Code). 
(4)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed in such a way as to deprive any interested party aggrieved by the finding and decision of the Planning Commission, of his right to appeal to the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals in the manner and time set forth in Section 12.03 of the Charter. However, should the finding and decision of the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals be contrary to the position of such appellant, the appellant shall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies and such decision of the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall be deemed to be final, except as provided in subsection (n)(2) hereof.

(a)  Purpose. This chapter provides for flexible residential development housing within the City. The purpose of these regulations is to achieve: 
(1)  A variation of residential lot sizes without increasing the overall density of the development; 
(2)  A more efficient pattern of residential growth than what would generally be achieved under conventional development, resulting in substantial savings through shorter utilities and streets; and 
(3)  A development pattern which shall preserve, maintain and effectively utilize significant open space and environmental resources, such as wooded areas, ravines, streams, wetlands and scenic vistas; 
    Significant environmental resources may include natural features identified in adopted plans. 
    In accordance with the above stated purposes, the residential overlay technique shall be utilized where surrounding land uses, topography or other physical characteristics of the subject property are such that this development shall produce a superior living environment or shall promote the preservation of significant environmental resources which would not otherwise be preserved by the underlying zoning classification. It is specifically not the intent of these regulations to allow indiscriminate reduction of normally required lot sizes and dimensions to facilitate subdivisions not meeting the above described purposes. 
(b)  Definitions. 
(1)  Residential overlay , as used in this chapter, means a residential development wherein the overall density is consistent with the underlying zoning district over which the Residential Overlay District is applied, but modifications are permitted in lot size and shape to concentrate residential development in portions of the overall tract, thereby maintaining the remainder of the tract as permanent common open space. 
(2)  Significant open space and environmental resources , as used in this chapter, includes Natural Resource Map A - Soils Group 1 and 2 Hydric Soils and Hydric Inclusions in Soils with Hydric Components in Franklin County; Natural Resources Map B - Ravines and Steep Slopes; and Natural Resources Map C. "Significant open space" includes identified historic and archeological resources. These maps from the adopted Planning Guide are incorporated herein by reference. 
(c)  Overlay Zoning District. The ROD District is intended as an overlay zoning district, to be used only in conjunction with the ER-1, ER-2, SF-1, SF-2, SF-3 and MR-1 Residential Zoning Districts, which shall be known as the base zoning district when the ROD is used. The development standards of the base district shall apply unless they are in conflict with the provisions of this section, in which case, the provisions of this section shall apply. 
    In recommending the approval of the use of the ROD Zoning District, the Planning Commission shall find that at least one of the following conditions exists as it relates to the subject property: 
(1)  The property is of such shape or size that normal subdivision platting technique would be difficult; or 
(2)  The property contains significant environmental resources which shall be maintained and preserved in their natural state. Such resources may include, but not be limited to wooded areas, ravines, streams, wetlands and scenic vistas. 
(d)  Permitted Uses. The permitted and/or conditional uses shall be as specified in the base zoning district. 
(e)  Minimum Project Area. The gross area of a tract of land to be developed within the Residential Overlay District shall be such that no fewer than six lots shall be created. 
(f)  Overall Residential Density. The maximum of permitted dwelling units shall be determined by dividing the net residential area by the minimum lot size in the base zoning district. Net residential area shall be that remaining after the following areas have been deleted from the gross project area: 
(1)  Land identified as within the 100-year floodplain on Official FEMA Flood Hazard Boundary Maps; 
(2)  An area equal to 20 percent of the gross property area representing that portion devoted to streets, regardless of the amount of land actually required for streets; and 
(3)  Land required to be set aside under Section 1109.08. Calculation of the net residential area shall be included on the ROD development plan. 
(g)  Yard Requirements. Yard requirements shall be delineated on the plat. The yard requirements of those lots at the perimeter of the residential overlay development shall be not less than that which would be permitted in the base zoning district. 
(h)  Minimum Lot Area. None. 
(i)  Utilities. All electrical, telephone, cable television and similar utility systems shall be located underground. 
(j)  Private Roads. Private roads as a common easement may be used to provide internal circulation to housing in the ROD District, in accordance with the following: 
(1)  The easement shall not be counted as required open space. 
(2)  The easement shall be approved as part of the subdivision plat as the most appropriate form of access to lots and/or structures. 
(3)  A landlocked lot fronting a private street right-of-way does not require a variance from Section 1105.08. 
(k)  Common Open Space. 
(1)  For each square foot of land area which is gained through reduction of lot size below the minimum requirements as specified in the base zoning district, at least an equal amount of land shall be preserved and dedicated as common open space in the development. Such open space shall comprise not less than 20 percent of the total size of the tract. Calculation of the open space requirement shall be provided by the applicant on the ROD development plan. 
(2)  The configuration, location and characteristics of the common open space shall be approved by the Planning Commission. In determining the acceptability of the proposed open space, the Planning Commission shall consider the following: 
A.  The common open space shall preserve the most environmentally significant portions of the site, including any wooded areas, ravines, streams, wetlands and scenic vistas. 
B.  The common open space should be contiguous and located so as to be accessible to most portions of the residential development. 
C.  The open space shall be, where possible, integrated with the design of the residential development, with portions of open space located adjacent to most areas of housing. 
(3)  Open space shall either be: 
A.  Dedicated to a homeowner's association who shall hold title to the land so retained as common open space; or 
B.  Granted to a conservation organization, historical society or some other group acceptable to the City. 
(l)  Procedures for ROD Development Plan. 
(1)  An applicant proposing to utilize the ROD as an overlay to one of the permitted base zoning districts shall submit an application for zoning change to the Planning Commission, in accordance with the procedures specified in Chapter 1133 and Article XI of the City Charter. This zoning change application including a ROD development plan text, shall become the ROD development plan, and serve as the preliminary plat. 
(2)  In addition to all filing requirements listed in Section 1105.02, Preliminary Plat Filing, minus the fee, the ROD development plan shall include a site plan which shall clearly indicate: 
A.  Project density, location, shape, size and height of any existing buildings; 
B.  Existing landscaping and/or forestation; 
C.  Floor areas and elevations of typical units; 
D.  Location and outlines of adjacent buildings within 200 feet from the boundary of the proposed ROD; 
E.  Calculation, location, amount and development of required open space; 
F.  Soils data superimposed over the plat and boundaries of woodlands and/or other natural vegetation; and 
G.  Such other material and data as may be necessary to evaluate and determine compliance with this chapter. 
(3)  The Planning Commission and Council shall process the ROD development plan consistent with the procedures specified in Chapter 1133 and Article XI of the City Charter. 
(4)  Building or construction within the ROD shall not occur until a final plat has been approved, consistent with Chapter 1105. A ROD final plat application shall not be submitted for approval until the ROD development plan has been approved by the Planning Commission and Council. 
(5)  Upon the establishment of a Residential Overlay District on a particular parcel by ordinance of Council, the zoning map shall be amended to indicate that the parcel is subject to a housing overlay and its development plan by the addition to the appropriate initial and a hyphen, that is, "ROD" preceding the symbolic designation of the underlying zoning district. 
(m)  Fees. 
(1)  The fee for filing a ROD development plan shall be as established in the Building and Zoning Fee Schedule set forth in Section 135.10 in Part One of these Codified Ordinances. The fee is to be submitted with the application and accompanying documents as set forth in this chapter. 
(2)  The fee for filing a ROD final plat of fifty acres or less shall be as established in the Building and Zoning Fee Schedule set forth in Section 135.10 in Part One of these Codified Ordinances. The fee is to be submitted with the final plat application and accompanying documents as set forth in this chapter and Section 1105.04, final plat filing. 
(Ord. 0128-2007. Passed 6-18-07; Ord. No. 0017-2017 , Exh. A, 4-3-17) 
1152.02 - LIMITED (L) OVERLAY DISTRICT. 
(a)  Purpose. The Limited Overlay District is created as an alternative response to those situations where the minimum development standards of an underlying zoning district are deemed inadequate to protect or maintain compatibility of land uses. 
    The Limited Overlay District is intended for restricted use where special circumstances or conditions fail to protect affected land uses. 
    The limitations placed within the Limited Overlay District to a property or properties shall apply to all parcels zoned under the Limited Overlay District and shall be deemed appropriate by the City where such limitations protect and preserve the welfare of the general public. 
    It is intended that an applicant for rezoning may voluntarily seek to commit the subject property and its owner to limitations and conditions not otherwise provided by the existing or proposed underlying zoning classification, or even any other zoning classification, by the establishment of a Limited Overlay. 
    This chapter provides the means to modify the application of the provisions of an underlying zoning district to a particular parcel or parcels by: 
(1)  Limiting the permitted uses; 
(2)  Increasing one or more of the minimum development standards; and 
(3)  Adding conditions for items not covered by the minimum development standards, or any of the above. 
    All standards of the underlying zoning district shall be applicable unless specifically superseded by the Limited Overlay in the ordinance establishing same for the subject parcel or parcels. 
(b)  Applicable Zoning Districts. The Limited Overlay District may be used in combination with all zoning districts other than single and two-family residential. 
(c)  Application. Any person or persons desiring the establishment of a Limited Overlay District on any lot or lots proposed to be rezoned shall file an application in conformance with Chapter 1133 of the Planning and Zoning Code and Article XI of the City Charter. 
(d)  Development Plan. In addition to filing such application, the applicant may be required to provide a signed and dated development plan composed of the text and a site plan(s) for the Limited Overlay proposed, setting out the means for addressing the above stated purpose and specifically identifying the following: 
(1)  Any limitation to be imposed on the normal range of permitted uses by the underlying zoning district; 
(2)  Any increase in a minimum development standard for the underlying zoning district; 
(3)  Any additional limitation or condition to be imposed and enforced; and 
(4)  The intended result to be obtained by any limitation or condition set out pursuant to the above. 
    The minimum standards of the underlying zoning district shall govern unless the development plan approved by Council specifically stipulates a more stringent standard. Such development plan shall be used only to increase standards and shall in no way be used or construed so as to grant a variance from or to decrease standards or requirements of the underlying zoning district. 
    The development plan shall set out each characteristic of the proposed limitations and conditions and shall be referenced in the body of the ordinance establishing a Limited Overlay for the subject parcel or parcels. 
    A final development plan that is in basic conformance with the approved development plan must be submitted in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 1108. 
(e)  Permitted Uses. Within a Limited Overlay District, the premises and/or buildings thereon shall only be used for any one or more of the uses permitted by the underlying zoning classification, unless the normal range of permitted uses is specifically limited by the development plan. If the development plan has a more restricted list of uses, then the development plan shall prevail. Conditional uses of the underlying zoning classification shall be considered permitted uses of the development plan only if those uses are specifically listed in the text of the development plan. 
(f)  Development Standards. Any use of a lot subject to a Limited Overlay shall meet or exceed each minimum development standard of the underlying zoning classification and other provisions of the Planning and Zoning Code unless more limited standards are specifically identified in the Limited Overlay development plan referenced in the ordinance passed by Council, in which event such more limited standards shall apply as promoting and maintaining the necessary uniformity of City planning. 
    The Limited Overlay standards shall comply with the following criteria: 
(1)  Reasonably related to planning guidelines and/or to the accomplishment of specified goals; 
(2)  Fair, protecting the legal rights for those affected; 
(3)  Understandable for those in the marketplace; and 
(4)  Simple for effective interpretation and enforcement by the City. 
    There is no minimum or maximum size required for a parcel to be subject to a Limited Overlay except that the limitations thereof shall apply to the entire tax parcel and such Limited Overlay shall include at least one tax parcel. An application may include more than one tax parcel provided that all parcels in a specific application are contiguous to each other. Parcels separated only by a public right-of-way shall be considered contiguous. 
(g)  Conditions and Limitations. Any use on a parcel subject to a Limited Overlay shall conform to each condition or limitation specifically identified and imposed in the development plan referenced in the ordinance passed by Council. 
(h)  Amendment. All general procedures required for amending or determining a zoning designation shall be applied to an amendment of any Limited Overlay permitted use, development standard, condition or limitation. 
(i)  Map Designation. Upon the establishment of a Limited Overlay on a particular parcel by ordinance of Council, the zoning map shall be amended to indicate that the parcel is subject to a Limited Overlay and its development plan by the addition to the appropriate initial and a hyphen, that is, "L-" preceding the symbolic designation of the underlying zoning district. 
(j)  Effect of the Approved Development Plan. A development plan approved hereunder shall be binding upon the applicant and the applicant's heirs, successors and assigns and shall limit and control the issuance or validity of any zoning certificate subject, however, to any valid and reasonable use of legislative authority in zoning regulations thereafter. The site plan for such certificate shall clearly indicate each condition and limitation of the approved development plan. Minor changes in the approved development plan may be made at the time of final development plan in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 1108.

(Ord. 82-89. Passed 9-19-89.) 
1161.04 - DISCONTINUANCE. 
    When, at the time of passage of this Zoning Ordinance or any amendments thereto, the lawful use of land, structures, buildings or signs exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Zoning Ordinance or amendments thereto, such uses may be continued so long as they are otherwise lawful, provided: 
(a)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning Ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted within such district. 
(b)  Any existing nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which was clearly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
(c)  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use as of the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance. 
(d)  If any such nonconforming use is discontinued, abandoned or ceases for any reason for a consecutive six-month period or for a period of time exceeding 18 months in any three-year period, except where government action impedes such use, any subsequent use of such land, building or structure shall conform to regulations specified by this Zoning Ordinance for the district in which the land, building or structure is located. 
(e)  No additional structures or expansion of existing structures which are not in compliance with requirements of this Zoning Ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming land use. 
(f)  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is damaged by fire, explosion, flood, riot or act of God, the nonconforming use may be continued provided the building, structure or land has not been destroyed to an extent of more than 50 percent of its fair market value or 50 percent of the total gross square footage, whichever estimate is considered to be most appropriate by the City, provided such reconstruction is started within six months of such calamity and substantially completed within 12 months of such calamity. 
(g)  The change of a nonconforming use to a permitted use of the zoning district in which the nonconforming use is located shall be allowed. 
(Ord. 82-89. Passed 9-19-89.) 
1161.05 - REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE. 
(a)  Ordinary repairs and maintenance, or repairs and replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, heating, air conditioning or plumbing may be undertaken on any nonconforming structure, or portion of a structure, provided the cubic content of the structure existing when it became nonconforming is not increased. 
(b)  When a nonconforming structure or any portion of any structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to a lack of repairs or maintenance and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of such physical condition, the structure shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformance with this Zoning Ordinance.

1165.01 - PURPOSE. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish permissive standards by which signs shall be regulated relative to time, place and manner. 
(a)  The City has determined that the individual user's right to convey a message must be balanced with the public's right to be free of signs which unreasonably compete, distract drivers and pedestrians, and produce confusion as determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee. It is the City's intent to provide business and industry in the City with equitable sign standards in accordance with fair competition and aesthetic standards acceptable to the community; to provide the public with a safe and effective means of locating businesses, services and points of interest within the City; and to provide for a safe vehicular and pedestrian traffic environment. This chapter is based on the premise that signs are subject to control as much as noise, odor, debris and other similar characteristics of land use, and that if not regulated, can become a nuisance to adjacent properties or the community in general, or depreciate the value of other properties within the community. To mitigate the potential negative consequences, reasonable limitations on signs are appropriate with respect to the size, height and construction of signs, and the time, place and manner of their display. 
(b)  Specifically, the City has determined that regulations for signs are desirable in order to: 
(1)  Prevent or limit traffic or pedestrian accidents, injuries, deaths, and property damages resulting from obstructed vision, distraction or confusion to the public due to the undue proliferation of signs; 
(2)  Minimize the risk of damage and injuries from signs that are dilapidated, structurally-deficient, wind-blown or electric shock hazards; 
(3)  Achieve a degree of uniformity and balance in the size, height, number and placement of signs; 
(4)  Enhance the aesthetics of the City by regulating the amount of time which temporary signs may be displayed, regulating the location of signs relative to public rights-of-way, and regulating the manner that signs are displayed; 
(5)  Visually promote and maintain residential, commercial and industrial districts; 
(6)  Maintain and preserve the City's values in residential, commercial and industrial districts; 
(7)  Prevent blight characterized by oversized, overcrowded, abandoned, obsolete and/or dilapidated signs; 
(8)  Eliminate nonconforming signs; 
(9)  Facilitate an equitable, regulatory and administrative process involving signs located within the City; and 
(10)  Protect the public's right to receive information protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.

1165.05 - NONCONFORMING SIGNS. 
    Any sign erected prior to the effective date of this section, constructed in conformance with the ordinances and other applicable laws in effect on the date of its construction, but which by reason of its size, height, location, design, or construction is not in conformance with the regulations of this chapter may be continued as a legal nonconforming sign. 
(a)  Any nonconforming sign displayed on the premises shall be removed or brought into conformance with the provisions of this chapter before a permit for a new sign may be issued. 
(b)  A legal nonconforming sign shall immediately lose its legal nonconforming designation and shall be immediately brought into compliance with this chapter and a new permit secured if so required, or shall be removed upon any of the following occurrences: 
(1)  The nonconforming sign is structurally altered, enlarged, relocated or replaced.

1165.06 - MEASUREMENT OF SIGN AREA. 
(a)  The maximum permitted sign area shall apply to the entire area enclosing the extreme limits of writing, representation, emblem or figure. 
(1)  Any frame, material, or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate a sign from the background against which it is placed shall count toward the maximum permitted sign area. For example, if a wall sign is painted with background colors and/or graphics integral to the overall graphic scheme of a sign, the entire wall shall be considered a sign and its measurement computed as such. If a sign is painted on a wall, and the sign can be logically separated and measured separately from the background graphics, the background graphic scheme shall not be computed in the sign size. 
(2)  Necessary supports or uprights on which a sign is placed are excluded from the computation of sign area. 
(b)  Lots fronting two or more public rights of way are allowed the permitted sign size for each street frontage. The square footage permitted for each street frontage cannot be combined and used on one frontage. In no case shall the maximum aggregate sign area for the respective zoning district be exceeded unless expressly permitted by this chapter. 
(c)  The permitted actual size of a sign shall apply to each facing of a sign structure; however, where signs are double-faced, placed back-to-back, or in a "V-type" construction when the "V" is at a 45-degree angle or less, only one side of the sign shall be counted. Back-to-back signs must be enclosed within the same cabinet or affixed to the same pole and not separated by more than 18 inches to qualify under this section. 
(d)  The overall height of a freestanding sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at average grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Average grade shall be construed to be the lower of: 
(1)  Existing grade prior to construction or 
(2)  The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filing, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating or increasing the height of the sign. 
    In cases in which the grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public road or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zoned lot, whichever is lower. 
(Ord. 0212-2007. Passed 10-1-07.) 
1165.07 - TEMPORARY SIGNS. 
    Temporary signs, except zoning change signs as required in Chapter 1133, shall comply with the following regulations: 
(a)  Sign Placement. All temporary freestanding signs shall be placed no closer than ten feet from the pavement of the travel lane of a public or private street. 
(b)  Duration. Temporary signs shall be displayed only for the time duration permitted based upon the useful life of the sign. 
(c)  Useful Life. Temporary sign faces constructed of the following materials shall be deemed to have a useful life span of the specified duration: 
(1)  Cardboard, posterboard or paper: three consecutive days.

1165.09 - DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, AND MAINTENANCE OF SIGNS. 
    All signs shall be designed, constructed and maintained in conformity with the following provisions: 
(a)  Design Criteria. In Olde Gahanna, signs must comply with the design review requirements of Section 1197.09 of this Code (Design Review Districts Standards). All other signs shall be designed to meet the following provisions: 
(1)  Sign graphic. The shape and graphic character of a sign shall strive for an integrated design that constitutes a substantial aesthetic improvement to the site and surrounding area, and that contains elegant, uncluttered elements of classic design style or reflects the unique, historic character of the City. 
A.  Signs shall provide for aesthetic presentation of the sign message through careful consideration of color combinations, illumination, sign placement, letter height, proportion and spacing, and by avoiding use of small and/or excessive lettering. 
B.  The advertising content of signs shall not detract from the identification purpose and the legibility of signs. 
(2)  Building signs. 
A.  The size and location of permanent building signs shall be reviewed in terms of their relationship to the building entry, height of sign fascia, or size of wall where the sign is to be installed and the relationship to other signs on a building, as well as visibility from the street, sidewalk or parking lot. 
B.  An applicant shall be permitted to decrease the sign area from one building frontage for the purpose of erecting or installing a sign on a building facade that does not have street frontage. 
C.  On multi-tenant commercial establishments, permanent building signs shall be evaluated for compatibility as part of a sign program with the building fascia and neighboring signs in terms of size, color, lighting materials, sign style, and quality. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner of a multi-tenant establishment to determine if the sign area shall be devoted to identification of the building, the anchor occupant(s), all occupants, or some combination thereof. 
(3)  Freestanding signs. Permanent freestanding signs shall be of a style, material, and design compatible with the associated building. 
A.  The construction materials of freestanding signs should be compatible with the associated buildings. 
B.  Freestanding signs shall be sited so that they integrate with the location of street trees and other site landscaping, and to avoid obscuring the view of adjacent freestanding signs. 
C.  A landscaped area, required as follows, shall be provided, and centered around the base of all freestanding signs. 
1.  Monument signs: Fifty square feet. 
2.  Ground signs: Sixty square feet. 
3.  Pole signs: Seventy square feet. 
a.  The landscaped area shall be comprised of a variety of natural materials, such as shrubbery, hedges, herbs, trees and other plants, earth mounds, flowers, and groundcover. Plant material should be chosen to maintain twelve months of foliage. 
b.  Ground cover shall be limited to 50 percent of the total landscaped area. 
c.  All plantings shall be properly installed, well-maintained, weeded, mulched and kept free of trash and debris. 
(b)  Sign Placement. Projection into right-of-way. No sign shall be located within or above any public right-of-way, nor shall any temporary sign project beyond the property line, unless expressly permitted herein. 
(c)  Construction. All signs shall be constructed to meet the City Building and Electrical Codes. 
(d)  Maintenance. All signs shall be maintained in a safe, clean and attractive, and sound structural condition at all times free from peeling or missing paint, burned out light bulbs, holes, or broken, cracked, bent, warped, rotted, discolored, sagging, worn, torn, rusted, defective, or missing material parts. If the face of the sign is removed, a blank opaque panel must be installed until such time that new graphics are approved and installed. 
(Ord. 0212-2007. Passed 10-1-07.) 
1165.10 - ILLUMINATION OF SIGNS. 
    Signs may be illuminated in accordance with the following regulations. 
(a)  A development identification sign located at the entrance of a residential subdivision may only be externally illuminated. 
(b)  All other signs may be either internally or externally illuminated. 
(1)  Externally illuminated signs. 
A.  Illumination of signs shall be permitted with a lighting fixture that is steady and stationary, using approved electrical devices and shall be installed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and the City's Electrical Codes. 
B.  The intensity of sign lighting must not exceed the amount necessary to illuminate and make a sign legible. Externally lit signs may only be illuminated with "white" spectrum light concealed by a hood or any other material of indirect lighting. 
C.  Sign illumination must be directed downward aimed no higher than forty-five degrees above straight down (half-way between straight down and straight to the side). 
D.  Ground-mounted illumination shall be permitted for freestanding signs with a maximum height of less than six feet. 
E.  All lighting for the illumination of signs shall be shielded from the view of persons viewing the sign and directed so that the light shines only on the sign. 
(2)  Internally illuminated signs: Light bulbs or lighting tubes used for illuminating a sign shall not be visible through the sign face. 
(Ord. 0212-2007. Passed 10-1-07.) 
1165.11 - PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND REVIEW PROCESS.

1165.12 - VARIANCES AND APPEALS. 
(a)  Variance Procedure. This section shall not apply to temporary signs as defined in Section 1165.07 of this chapter. 
(1)  The standard for granting a variance which relates solely to area requirements is a lesser standard than that applied to variances which relate to use. An application for an area variance need not establish unnecessary hardship; it is sufficient that the application show practical difficulties. 
In determining whether a property owner seeking an area variance has encountered practical difficulties, Planning Commission shall consider and weight the following factors. 
A.  Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance; 
B.  Whether the variance is substantial; 
C.  Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a substantial detriment as a result of the variance; 
D.  Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, refuse); 
E.  Whether the property owner purchased the property with the knowledge of the zoning restriction; 
F.  Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated through some method other than a variance; 
G.  Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance; 
H.  Whether the sign is sufficiently compatible with the architectural and design character of the immediate neighborhood and all graphic design standards established for the district; and 
I.  Whether the sign will be hazardous to passing traffic or otherwise detrimental to the public safety and welfare. 
(2)  In granting such variance, the Planning Commission may specify the size, type and location of the sign, and impose such other reasonable terms, restrictions and conditions as it may deem to be in the public interest. 
(b)  Appeals. Any person affected by any decision of the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee or the Planning Commission made pursuant to this chapter may file an appeal with the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals in accordance with the requirements of Section 1127.08 (Appeal of Administrative Orders).

1167.21 - PRESERVATION ZONES. 
    Preservation zones are natural areas that protect both the aesthetic appearance and environmental significance including, but not limited to, woodlands, wetlands, ravines, floodplains, streams, lakes, ponds, and/or steep slopes and can provide effective buffers between different or same land uses. Such zones should be designated on the concerned property. It is the intent of this section to encourage the use of these preservation zones in new developments including single-family subdivisions, multi family, commercial and industrial construction. It is the further intent of this section not to preclude and/or prevent development, but to protect and preserve environmentally significant areas by fostering the use of buffer zones that could be integrated within the development. Preservation zones shall be used in a manner to promote and protect the public safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity, and general welfare of the City. 
(a)  Determination of Preservation Zones. Environmentally significant areas shall be required to have a preservation zone(s). The natural resources maps B and C in the Gahanna Planning Guide are guides in determining the environmentally significant areas. These maps shall be a guide in determining areas that shall be required to have preservation zones. However, this shall not preclude the administration, Landscape Board and/or Planning Commission from recommending and/or approving preservation zones in other areas that are considered to be environmentally significant. In determining preservation zones, the administration, Landscape Board and/or Planning Commission determines that the area needs to be protected from development and which could serve as a buffer between different or same uses. 
(b)  Approval of Preservation Zones. 
(1)  The Planning Commission shall have the authority to approve a preservation zone for a subdivision and/or a planned district. This approval shall occur during the preliminary plat stage and shall follow the procedures set out in Chapter 1105. The administration, and/or Landscape Board may recommend to the Planning Commission the location of a preservation zone. 
(2)  The Planning Commission shall have the authority to approve a preservation zone in accordance with the established Design Review Districts except when a preservation zone has already been approved by the Planning Commission for a Planned District. Such approval shall become part of the certificate of appropriateness. 
(3)  Approval of preservation zones shall incorporate the stipulations in Section 1167.21(c). Preservation zones shall become part of the final plat or final development plan for subdivisions by the Planning Commission and approved by Council. Preservation zones shall become part of the site plan that is part of the certificate of appropriateness approval. 
(c)  Preservation Zones. 
(1)  Before any activity, clearing, and/or construction begins, the entire preservation zone shall be enclosed with at least three foot high orange construction fencing to prevent any access to the area. Such fencing shall protect the root systems of vegetation within the preservation zone. The fencing can only be taken down for an individual lot when an occupancy permit has been issued for the structure on the concerned lot. The fencing shall remain on the undeveloped lots until occupancy permits are granted for each lot. 
(2)  Said preservation zone shall not be disturbed any time before, during, or after construction except for necessary access as approved by the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee. 
(3)  No permanent or temporary structure, building, or fence shall ever be placed upon, in, or under said preservation zone. 
(4)  Utilities and roadways in preservation zones may only be installed consistent with an Environmental Plan and/or Mitigation Plan. 
(5)  No development, clearing, thinning, construction, or work shall be performed in the preservation zone except for necessary construction as deemed necessary by the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee. If a preservation zone is disturbed at any time (including but not limited to utility construction and/or easement, building or grading construction) by the developer, contractor, subcontractor, house builder, property owner, or a representative, such disturbances that occur shall be restored to an approved condition. Diseased trees and/or diseased vegetation may be removed with the approval of the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee. Obnoxious weeds and/or brush of less than one inch caliper may be removed without destroying the integrity of the preservation zone. 
(6)  No dirt, stones, wood, or debris shall be placed within the preservation zone. 
(7)  Trees located in a preservation zone that have been pushed over, cut apart, blown over, or fall due to aging and/or deterioration are the property owner's responsibility to remove from the preservation zone. 
(8)  A utility company servicing and/or installing utilities in the designated preservation zone shall also be subject to these restrictions. 
(9)  These restrictions shall be printed on the final plat, the final development plan, and/or site plan. 
(10)  Drainage shall not be changed in a manner that will damage the preservation zone. 
(11)  The developer shall notify each property purchaser in the concerned subdivision and/or development of the preservation zone requirements. Such notification shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the property purchaser at the time of closing. 
(12)  The developer shall notify all contractors, utility companies, and/or cable companies doing work in the concerned subdivision of the preservation zone requirements before construction begins. 
(d)  Penalty. 
(1)  If Section 1167.21 is violated during construction, the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee, City Engineer, or Chief Building Official may place a stop work order on the development, stopping all construction until such time as the preservation zone is restored to an approved condition as determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee. No person shall violate a preservation zone after occupancy. 
(2)  A homeowner and/or resident who violates any provision of this section or fails to comply with any of its requirements, including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with preservation zones, shall be found guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 and, in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case, including the costs of restoring the area to its original condition prior to the violation. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. 
(3)  An organization (including but not limited to a developer, contractor, and/or subcontractor) who violates any provision of this section or fails to comply with any of its requirements, including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with preservation zones, shall be found guilty of a minor misdemeanor as an organization and shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 and, in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case, including the costs of restoring the area to its original condition prior to the violation. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. 
(4)  Nothing herein contained shall prevent Council from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

(b)  Only decorative open fences as defined in Section 1171.01(d), of a height no greater than 48 inches, may be erected in any area designated as a "No Build Zone." 
(c)  A fence of permitted height and design may be constructed along or upon common property lines and across any utility easement so as to allow maximum use of the area to be enclosed. Fences placed on utility easements shall provide access to manholes, utility boxes, cleanouts or other apparatus that may be used from time to time for maintenance of the utility. Fences placed on drainage easements shall allow for the proper flow of water. Fences that are being proposed to be placed on utility and/or drainage easements shall require prior approval from the City Engineer. 
(d)  No fence erected in a residentially or commercially zoned area shall have as part of its design or construction metal prongs or spikes, or barbed wire.

No fence other than an invisible fence shall have as part of its design or construction an electrified portion. 
(e)  A fence shall not be located within three feet of a utility box, manhole or other apparatus that may be used for maintenance of the utility. However, a gate and/or removable section of fencing may be placed within this three-foot restriction if such gate and/or removable section provides sufficient access to the utility box, manhole or other apparatus. When a fence obstructs access to a utility box, manhole or other public apparatus for maintaining utilities, the owner shall be required to remove and replace such fence at his/her expense without remuneration from the City. This section shall not prohibit the City from removing any fence located in a utility or drainage easement that obstructs a utility box, manhole or other apparatus or obstructs the proper flow of water. 
(f)  Any fence of a permitted height and design shall not extend in the front yard beyond the building setback line. Corner lots shall comply with the following: 
    A fence may be located one-half the distance between the required building setback line and the public right-of-way only in the side yard if the fence is a decorative open fence and does not exceed a height of 42 inches. Such fences shall not be located so as to encroach upon the required sight triangle area established under Section 1167.16. 
(g)  A decorative open fence shall be permitted in the side and rear yards. 
A decorative open non-enclosing fence not more than 42 inches in height may be located in front of the required building setback line not more than one-half the distance between the required building setback lines and corresponding street public right-of-way. On corner lots, such fences may not be located so as to encroach upon the required sight triangle area established under Section 1167.16. 
(h)  Privacy and/or chain link fences shall be prohibited in the side and front yards. 
(i)  Any fence constructed between the required building setback line and street public right-of-way shall not prevent or hinder access to the residence by vehicles and personnel responding to a fire, police or medical emergency. 
(j)  A private swimming pool constructed on the premises of a detached one- or two-family dwelling shall be enclosed by a fence erected wholly on said premises. On a case by case basis, the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee may approve a fence permit application for a fence not wholly on the pool owner's property. However, if a neighbor's fence, which makes up any portion of the pool enclosure is removed for any reason, the owner of the property on which the pool is located shall be responsible for restoring the pool to an enclosed state. This restoration shall be performed within 30 days of the date that the zoning division is made aware of the situation. All fences shall conform to the following requirements: 
(1)  For in-ground pools, the top of the fencing shall be at least 48 inches above the grade measured on the side of the fence which faces away from the pool, but not to exceed 72 inches in height as measured from grade along the line of the fence as installed.

B.  Solid fences which do not have openings, such as masonry or stone wall, shall not contain indentations or protrusions except for normal construction tolerances and tooled masonry joints. 
C.  Spacing between vertical members of a wood or vinyl fence shall not exceed one and three quarter inches in width. 
D.  Maximum mesh size for chain link fences shall not exceed one and three quarter inch square unless the fence is provided with slats fastened at the top or bottom which reduce the openings to no more than one and three quarter inches. 
E.  In a lattice fence the maximum opening formed by the diagonal members shall be no more than one and three quarter inches. 
F.  Spacing between vertical members of a decorative metal fence shall be no more than four inches and any gate shall have no opening greater than one-half inch within 18 inches of the release mechanism. 
G.  Access gates to the pool shall comply with this subsection (j)(1)A. through F., and shall be equipped with a lock operated by a key, or combination lock, and shall be locked when not in use. Pedestrian access gates shall open outward, away from the pool, and shall be self-closing and have a self-latching device. Where the release mechanism of a self-latching device is located less than 54 inches from the bottom of the gate, (a) the release mechanism shall be located on the pool side of the gate at least three [inches] below the top and (b) the gate and fence shall have no opening greater than one-half inch within 18 inches of the release mechanism. 
(2)  For aboveground pools, fencing shall be the same as this subsection (j)(1) hereof except that if the sides of the pool are 42 inches or more above the minimum adjacent grade, and the pool is equipped with a removable ladder or a ladder that folds up and locks in an upright position when the pool is not in use, or the steps or ladder is surrounded by a fence as described in this subsection (j)(1), then additional fencing will not be required. If an aboveground pool has a fence at the top of the pool, the maximum vertical clearance between the top of the pool and the bottom of the fence shall not exceed four inches. A 36 inch minimum guardrail conforming to the Residential Code of Ohio is required for any porch, balcony or raised floor surface located more than 30 inches above the floor or grade below. 
(k)  Temporary snow fences not exceeding 48 inches in height, may be erected in non-residential areas without permit between December 1 of any year and the following March 31 for the purpose of controlling snow drifting across sidewalks, driveways, and roadways. Snow fences may extend beyond or be located in front of the required building setback line not more than one-half the distance between the required building setback line and corresponding street public right-of-way. On corner lots, snow fences may not be located so as to encroach upon the required sight triangle area established under Section 1167.16. Snow fences shall not be erected or located that would: 
(1)  Hinder access to the residence by vehicles and personnel responding to a fire, police or medical emergency; or 
(2)  Cause snow to accumulate in a manner which would encroach upon or block any public right-of-way, hinder proper operation of Municipal snow removal equipment, or block access to or cause damage to adjacent properties. 
(l)  Fences shall be maintained in good condition, be structurally sound, safe, and attractively finished at all times. Any repairs or replacement ordered by the zoning division shall be made within 30 days of the date of the order. Grounds between fences and property lines and between fences shall be well maintained at all times. Any fence shall be designed, constructed and finished so the supporting members thereof shall face the property of the owner of the fence. If a fence does not meet these standards, the owner of the property with the fence shall be subject to the penalty in Section 1171.99. 
(Ord. 0151-2009. Passed 9-21-09; Ord. 0198-2009. Passed 9-8-09; Ord. No. 0017-2017 , Exh. A, 4-3-17) 
1171.04 - COMMERCIAL AND MULTI-FAMILY DISTRICT FENCES. 
(a)  All fencing required to separate the several usage districts in the City or as required for screening according to the Planning and Zoning Code or as required by the Planning Commission shall conform to these specifications as written or as may be modified by the Chief Building Official. All such fencing shall be constructed of quality materials and methods shall conform to generally accepted standards. The fence shall be six feet in height, unless greater height is required by the Planning and Zoning Code. 
    Decorative or non-decorative fence not otherwise required by the City shall not be governed by this section, but shall be constructed as described in other sections of the Planning and Zoning Code. 
(b)  If wood is to be used, it shall be pressure-treated material, cedar, or redwood. Wood posts shall be not less than six inches by six inches and shall be buried not less than 32 inches in the ground, and be surrounded by concrete. Posts of any other materials shall be buried not less than 32 inches in the ground, and be surrounded by concrete. An inch or more of gravel shall be placed in the bottom of the post holes before installation of the post in order to insulate it from contact with soil but not restrict drainage of ground water. Concrete shall completely surround the post and shall be at least two inches in thickness between the post and the earth. Wood stringers shall be two inch by six-inch wood. Boards shall be one inch by six inches by six feet and placed adjacent to each other with not more than one-fourth inch gap between boards. In every case, the "neat" or "finished" side shall face the street or adjacent property. 
(c)  A regulated swimming pool shall be enclosed by a fence conforming to the following requirements: 
(1)  Regulated swimming pools shall be provided with an enclosure surrounding the pool area. 
(2)  The enclosure shall extend not less than six feet above the ground. All gates shall be self-closing and self-latching with latches places at least four feet above the ground. However, if said gate is an attached gate while the pool is open, said gate shall be locked during the off season and in season closed hours. 
(3)  Enclosure fences shall be constructed to prohibit the passage of a sphere larger than four inches in diameter through any opening or under the fence. Fences shall be designed to withstand a horizontal concentrated load of 200 pounds applied on a one square foot area at any point of the fence. 
(4)  The use of a pool cover, capable of supporting at least 300 pounds shall be encouraged during any period of time when the pool is closed for more than 72 consecutive hours or during any off season, in addition to the protection afforded by the enclosure, gate, and latch described herein. 
(Ord. 0112-2009. Passed 5-18-09.) 
1171.05 - VARIANCES AND APPEALS. 
(a)  Variance Procedure. 
(1)  The standard for granting a variance which relates solely to area requirements is a lesser standard than that applied to variances which relate to use. An application for an area variance need not establish unnecessary hardship: it is sufficient that the application show practical difficulties. 
In determining whether a property owner seeking an area variance has encountered practical difficulties, Planning Commission shall consider and weigh the following factors: 
A.  Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance; 
B.  Whether the variance is substantial; 
C.  Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a substantial detriment as a result of the variance; 
D.  Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, refuse); 
E.  Whether the property owner purchased the property with the knowledge of the zoning restriction; 
F.  Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated through some method other than a variance; 
G.  Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance; 
H.  Whether the fence is sufficiently compatible with the architectural and design character of the immediate neighborhood; and 
I.  Whether the fence will be hazardous to passing traffic or otherwise detrimental to the public safety and welfare. 
(2)  In granting such variance, the Planning Commission may specify the size, type and location of the fence, and impose such other reasonable terms, restrictions and conditions as it may deem to be in the public interest. 
(b)  Appeals. Any person affected by any decision of the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee or the Planning Commission made pursuant to this chapter may file an appeal with the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals.

1171.99 - CIVIL REMEDIES AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES. 
(a)  Civil Remedies. If any fence is erected, constructed, reconstructed, relocated, altered, converted or maintained, or used in violation of this Zoning Ordinance, the City, in addition to any other remedies provided for herein, shall institute proceedings as are authorized by law to prevent and enjoin such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, relocation, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use, or to correct or abate such violation. 
(b)  Criminal Penalty. Any person, firm or corporation violating any provision, amendment or supplement to this chapter, or failing to obey any lawful order of the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee or his/her designee issued in pursuance thereof, shall be deemed guilty of a minor misdemeanor. Each and every day during which such violation of any provision, amendment or supplement of this chapter occurs or each and every day during which there is a failure to obey a lawful order of the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee, may be deemed a separate offense.

The Administrative Review Team shall state the reasons for their decisions in the minutes and provide a written record of the decision to the applicant. 
B.  Prior to reaching a decision, if the Administrative Review Team determines that an application does not meet the applicable review standards as provided in this chapter, but determines that the application could meet those criteria with modifications that could not be reasonably conditioned, the applicant may request that the application be tabled to provide the opportunity to make those modifications. If the request for tabling is granted, a new review period shall begin on the date the applicant submits a complete application with revised materials and shall be subject to the timeframe for rendering a decision as provided in  1181.05(d)(8). 
C.  Following the approval of an application for administrative review, the applicant may proceed with the process for obtaining a certificate of zoning plan approval and building permit, consistent with the approval as granted. All construction and development under any building permit shall comply with the approval, as applicable. 
(4)  Certificate of zoning plan approval. A certificate of zoning plan approval issued by the Director verifying compliance with all applicable zoning requirements is required prior to modification, extension, or alteration of wireless facilities. 
(d)  Variances. 
(1)  Purpose and applicability. The intent of this division (D) is to provide an administrative process to allow minor deviations from the strict application of requirements of this chapter caused by unusual site or development conditions or other similar conditions that require reasonable adjustments, but remain consistent with the intent of this chapter. Examples include, but are not limited to, adjustments to wireless communications facility setbacks, landscaping and screening, or other similar features or elements. 
(2)  Review procedure. 
A.  An application for administrative departure may be submitted with an application for administrative review, or at any time after an application has been submitted and before a decision or recommendation by the Administrative Review Team has been made. If an application for administrative departure is made after an application for administrative review has been filed, the Director may require that the time period for administrative review start over on the day the request for administrative departure is received. 
B.  An application for an administrative departure may be processed simultaneously with the application for administrative review to which it relates. The Administrative Review Team shall determine whether each requested administrative departure is approved, approved with conditions, or denied. 
C.  Should the Administrative Review Team find that the request does not meet the criteria for an administrative departure, the applicant may file for a variance in accordance with Part Eleven of this Code of Ordinances, or submit a new application for administrative review. 
(3)  Criteria for administrative departure approval. The Administrative Review Team shall make its decision on an administrative departure based on the following criteria: 
A.  The need for the administrative departure is caused by unique site conditions, conditions on surrounding properties, and is not being requested simply to reduce cost or as a matter of general convenience; 
B.  The administrative departure does not have the effect of authorizing any wireless communications facility type that is not otherwise permitted in that zoning district; 
C.  The administrative departure does not modify any numerical development standard by more than ten percent of the requirement; and 
D.  The administrative departure, if approved, will ensure that the wireless communications facility is of equal or greater development quality with respect to design, material, and other features than without the administrative departure. 
(e)  Appeals. The determination rendered by the Administrative Review Team may be appealed to the Planning Commission within 20 days of the decision by any person aggrieved by the decision. The Appeal shall be filed with the City, specifying the grounds, in conformance with Part Eleven of this Code of Ordinances. 
(1)  An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the Director certifies to the Planning Commission, after notice of appeal has been filed, that, by reason of the facts stated in the record of determination, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In this case, the proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court of record. 
(2)  In deciding the appeal, the Planning Commission shall determine, in conformance with Part Eleven of this Code of Ordinances, whether the decision was made using the proper requirements and standards of this chapter. The decision of the Planning Commission is limited to the information that was available to the Administrative Review Team for the initial decision, including any materials included as part of the written record of the decision. Additional testimony is not appropriate. 
(3)  If the Planning Commission determines that the Administrative Review Team made an improper decision the Commission may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may make an order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the Administrative Review Team. 
(4)  The findings of the Planning Commission shall be based on and supported by substantial evidence contained in the decision. After action by the Planning Commission on the application, the Clerk of Council shall mail to the applicant a Record of Action taken which shall contain the motion as carried by the Planning Commission to include any conditions. . A final determination of the Planning Commission may be appealed to the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals. The decision of the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall be final. 
(f)  Concurrent application review. 
(1)  Applications for building permits, electrical permits, other applicable permits, and certificates of zoning plan approval associated with the building permit application process may be submitted with the application for administrative review and may be processed and reviewed concurrently with the administrative review application if desired by the applicant. 
(2)  Review of the building permit applications and zoning approvals described in division (f)(1) of this section shall be subject to the statutory timing requirements that apply to building permit application reviews. Accordingly, the applicant should consider the nature and complexity of the request prior to submitting for concurrent review. 
(3)  Requests for certificates of zoning plan approval and building permits for wireless facilities cannot be approved for zoning compliance until an affirmative record of determination of the Administrative Review Team and all other zoning approvals are obtained and attached to the appropriate building permit documents. 
(g)  Prior to commencing regular operation of the Tower or Equipment Shelter, all Tower and Equipment Shelter owners and operators must submit a certificate of compliance with all current Federal Communications Commission regulations concerning electromagnetic radiation and other electronic emissions applicable to the Tower and Equipment Shelter.

(c)  Public Hearings. Before approving or denying the application before it, the Planning Commission shall hold at least one public hearing on such application, notice of which shall include place, time, date and nature of such applied for in a newspaper of general circulation in the City during the calendar week prior to the public hearing. Written notice of said hearing shall also be mailed by ordinary mail to the street addresses of contiguous and adjacent property owners of the property for which said hearing is being held. The failure of delivery of such notice shall not invalidate any such application. The names and addresses of all property owners entitled to notice of the public hearing shall be furnished by the applicant. Where the subject of such public hearing involves 50 or more of the property owners of the City, then written notice to owners of the hearing, as provided in the preceding paragraph, shall not be required. 
(d)  Conditional use review considerations. In addition to any standards for consideration of applications for conditional use review pursuant to Part Eleven of this Code of Ordinances, the Planning Commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether the application should be approved: 
(1)  Compliance with the requirements of this chapter; 
(2)  Height of the proposed tower or facility and its proximity to adjacent structures; 
(3)  Nature of the potential for adverse effects on uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
(4)  Relationship of surrounding topography to the view from nearby properties; 
(5)  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage and the ability to screen the facilities from the view of nearby properties; 
(6)  Design of the tower or facility, with particular regard to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
(7)  Proposed ingress and egress for maintenance, safety, and prohibition of nuisances; 
(8)  Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures, with regard to the following: 
A.  New towers shall be approved only when other preferable alternatives are not available. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Planning Commission that no existing tower, structure, or alternative technology is available to fill the communication requirements. The applicant must prove by substantial evidence that a bona fide need exists for the new Tower and that no reasonable combination of locations, techniques, or technologies will obviate the need. The applicant must further submit evidence that it has made all reasonable efforts to procure antenna space on existing facilities but was denied or the cost of co-location exceeds the cost of a new facility by at least 50 percent. No new tower may be permitted unless such tower is capable of accommodating at least one additional wireless service facility. 
B.  An applicant shall submit required information for review by the Planning Commission related to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower, structure, or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
1.  No existing towers or other suitable structures are located within the specific geographic limits meeting the applicant's engineering requirements. 
2.  Existing towers or structures either do not have sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements, or have insufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
3.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause frequency interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
4.  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share or to adapt for sharing an existing tower or structure, are unreasonable. Costs that would exceed new tower development by 50 percent is an example of what may be presumed to be unreasonable. 
5.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
6.  The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a DAS or CMN using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable, but may be considered as a factor in the decision. 
7.  The applicant provides documentation that other tower owners were contacted in writing demonstrating the above considerations. 
(e)  The Director may hire an independent, qualified consultant to evaluate any technical aspects of the proposed design and location at the Applicant's sole cost. 
Prior to commencing regular operation of the Tower or Equipment Shelter, all Tower and Equipment Shelter owners and operators must submit a certificate of compliance with all current Federal Communications Commission regulations concerning electromagnetic radiation and other electronic emissions applicable to the Tower and Equipment Shelter. Every five years thereafter, Applicant shall at applicant's expense, prepare and submit to the City an updated radio frequency compliance report and certification certifying its equipment complies with all applicable FCC standards as of the five year anniversary date. 
(f)  In granting a conditional use, the Planning Commission may impose conditions to the extent necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower or antenna support structure on adjoining properties or to meet the review considerations of this section. 
(g)  The findings and decision of the Planning Commission shall be based on and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record and record of action which shall be forwarded to the applicant subject to  1181.05(d)(8). An Applicant may appeal any decision of the Planning Commission to the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals. The decision of the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall be final. 
(h)  The applicant shall sign an instrument, maintained by the City, agreeing to encourage and promote the joint use of telecommunications towers within the City and, to that extent, committing that there shall be no unreasonable act or omission that would have the effect of excluding, obstructing, or delaying joint use of any tower where fair and just market reasonable compensation of offered for such use. 
(i)  Prior to commencing regular operation of the Tower or Equipment Shelter, all Tower and Equipment Shelter owners and operators must submit a certificate of compliance with all current Federal Communications Commission regulations concerning electromagnetic radiation and other electronic emissions applicable to the Tower and Equipment Shelter. Every five years thereafter, Applicant shall at applicant's expense, prepare and submit to the City an updated radio frequency compliance report and certification certifying its equipment complies with all applicable FCC standards as of the five year anniversary date.

(a)  Abandonment. 
(1)  All providers utilizing wireless communications facilities shall notify the City in writing of the location and date that any tower facility located in the City whose use will be discontinued. If the use of the facility is discontinued for 180 days without notice from the owner/operator or the owner of the property, the Planning and Zoning Administrator may declare the facility to be abandoned (this excludes any dormancy period between construction and the initial use of the facility). The facility's owner/operator and property owner will receive written notice from the City and be instructed to either reactivate the facility's use within 180 days, or dismantle and remove the facility. 
(2)  If reactivation or dismantling does not occur as described in division (a)(1) above, the City will either remove or cause the facility and associated structures to be removed and assess the costs to the owner/operator and property owner. In the case of a multi-use tower or wireless communications facility, this provision does not become effective until all users cease use of the tower or facility. However, the City may cause the abandoned portions of systems on the multi-use tower or facility to be removed in accordance with this provision. 
(b)  Before initiating action to remove the facility, the City must provide the owner of the tower or wireless communications facility and the property owner 90 days written notice and an opportunity to be heard before the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals to appeal the decision. After this notice has been provided, or following a determination by the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals that the tower or facility has been abandoned, the City may take whatever action that is lawful to either 1) acquire the Tower and any appurtenances attached thereto at the then fair market value, or 2) order the removal or demolition of the tower or facility and all appurtenances. 
(c)  If the removal is appealed, a public hearing in accordance with City Code will be held before the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals following the 90-day notice required in division (b) of this section. All interested parties shall be allowed an opportunity to be heard at the public hearing. 
(d)  After a public hearing is requested by the tower or wireless communications facility owner and held pursuant to division (c) of this section, the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals may recommend that the Planning and Zoning Administrator order the removal or demolition of the tower. The City may require the tower or facility owner or former owner to pay for all expenses necessary to remove or demolish the tower or facility.

This shall be the case even when new facilities are added to a nonconforming installation, provided that any new facilities meet the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  Existing towers. Towers already in existence shall be allowed to continue their use as they exist as of the date of the adoption or amendment of this chapter. Routine maintenance (including replacement with a new tower of like construction and height serving the same purpose) shall be permitted. A replacement tower must be constructed within 180 days of removal of the initial facility unless the owner demonstrates that meeting this requirement is not possible due to conditions not reasonably within their control. The Director may permit new construction and/or equipment replacement, other than routine maintenance on an existing tower, provided it complies with the requirements of this chapter and applicable requirements of this Code of Ordinances to the extent that existing conditions permit. 
(c)  Damaged or destroyed nonconforming wireless communications facilities. Notwithstanding this section, nonconforming wireless communications facilities that are damaged or destroyed by actions outside the owner's control may be rebuilt without having to first obtain administrative review or a conditional use approval. Any other permits applicable to construction or reconstruction must be obtained. The type, height, and location of the wireless communications facility shall be the same as the original approved facility and constructed in accordance with currently applicable building codes. Permits for construction shall be obtained within 180 days from the date the facility is damaged or destroyed, and reconstruction shall be started within six months from the time of damage and shall be continued until completed. If no permit for construction is obtained, or if an issued permit expires, the facility shall be deemed abandoned as specified in  1181.08.

(5)  Allow providers to maintain uninterrupted wireless communication service through the use of temporary wireless facilities during extended periods of time due to substantial maintenance or capital projects undertaken or caused by the City. The approval shall not exceed the duration agreed to by the City and the affected wireless provider(s). 
(6)  Allow providers to maintain uninterrupted wireless communication service resulting from what the Director determines to be unforeseen circumstances and/or needs for temporary alternative wireless communication facilities. The approval shall not exceed the duration agreed to by the City and the affected wireless provider(s). 
(7)  The Director may permit one extension equal to the time periods permitted above, provided the extension is requested in writing prior to the expiration of the original approval period. Extensions may be granted provided the Director finds that the extension is reasonably necessary to resolve or accommodate the reasons for the original approval. 
(b)  Application and approval. 
(1)  Due to the emergency nature often associated with temporary wireless facilities, authority to locate a temporary wireless communications facility in the city will be subject to the approval of the Director after review by any other members of the Administrative Review Team that the Director deems necessary following receipt of a completed application for a temporary wireless communications facility. 
(2)  A temporary wireless communications facility may only be approved by the City for the limited purposes and time periods described in division (A) of this section. 
(3)  Except as authorized by the Director during declared emergencies, all approved temporary wireless communications facilities shall: 
A.  Be limited in height by the requirements of the zoning district in which the site is located. The Director may permit a greater height if the height is required for the function of the temporary wireless communications facility and no other reasonable alternative exists. 
B.  Be set back a minimum of the height of the proposed tower from any adjoining or adjacent property line, as measured from the nearest part of the facility and/or any associated equipment. The Director may permit a lesser setback if the location is required for the function of the temporary wireless communications facility and no other reasonable alternative location exists. 
C.  Minimize the visual impact of ground equipment to adjoining or adjacent properties. 
D.  Provide temporary screening as may be required by the Director, such as available natural land formations, plant materials, and natural foliage to effectively screen from view as much of the temporary wireless communications facility as reasonably possible. 
E.  Only commence installation at the approved site 48 hours before actual site use may begin.

Footnotes: 

CHAPTER 1191 - Regulatory Flood Hazard Area 

1191.01 - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION. 
    Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City of Gahanna, State of Ohio, adopts Chapter 1191, Regulatory Flood Hazard Area. 
(Ord. 90-94. Passed 6-21-94.) 
1191.02 - FINDINGS OF FACT. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 90-94. Passed 6-21-94.) 
1191.03 - STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(a)  Protect human life and health; 
(b)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(c)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(d)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(e)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; and 
(f)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas. 
(Ord. 90-94. Passed 6-21-94.) 
1191.04 - METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
(a)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(b)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(c)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(d)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(e)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. 90-94. Passed 6-21-94.)

The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining such permits as required including permits issued by the Department of the Army under Section ten of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
(3)  Review all floodplain use permits to determine if the proposed development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are delineated in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the Flood Insurance Study. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood information. If the proposed development is located within a designated floodway, assure that the encroachment provision of Sections 1191.21, 1191.22 and 1191.23 are met. 
(4)  The Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee shall file all charges on behalf of the City of Gahanna for all violations of this chapter and such actions shall be the act of the City. 
(b)  Use of Other Base Flood Elevation and Floodway Data. Areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with Section 1191.07 "Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard", are designated as Zone A on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map. Within these areas, the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, in order to administer Section 1191.20(a) "Specific Standards, Residential Construction"; Section 1191.20(b), "Specific Standards, Nonresidential Construction"; 1191.21 "Floodways"; 1191.22 "Prohibited Uses in Floodway Portion"; and 1191.23 "Permitted Uses in Floodway Portion". 
(c)  Information to be Obtained and Maintained. Where base flood elevation data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map, regardless of the source of such data, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  Obtain and record the actual elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially improved structures, and record whether or not such structures contain an enclosure below the lowest floor; 
(2)  For all new or substantially improved flood proofed nonresidential structures: 
A.  Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was flood proofed; and 
B.  Maintain the flood proofing documentations required in Section 1191.12(a)(3); and 
C.  Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter. 
(d)  Alteration of Watercourses. 
(1)  Notify adjacent communities and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A watercourse is considered to be altered if any change occurs within its banks. 
(2)  Maintain engineering documentation required in Section 1191.12(a)(4) that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse will not be diminished. 
(3)  Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. 
(e)  Interpretation of Flood Boundaries. Make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map boundary and field elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile shall prevail. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 1191.18, Variance Procedure.

(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The availability of alternative locations, for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(6)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

(2)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(4)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
A.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
B.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
C.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in Section 1191.20(a) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(5)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the flood protection elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

1191.21 - FLOODWAYS. 
(a)  Areas With Floodways. The Flood Insurance Study referenced in Section 1191.07 identifies a segment within areas of special flood hazard known as a floodway. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood information as specified in Section 1191.16(b). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential. The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas: 
(1)  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices demonstrates that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (a)(1) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 1191.20, Specific Standards. 
(3)  Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such requests shall be submitted by the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and shall meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.

1193.01 - ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE. 
(a)  The City Engineer shall be responsible for enforcement of the Stormwater Management Policy and shall not allow any development of land area exceeding one acre in size unless such development meets the design requirements herein. 
(b)  The Planning Commission shall not approve the final plat of any development or subdivision over which it has jurisdiction without certification from the City Engineer that such development or subdivision shall be in full compliance with the design requirements herein. 
(Ord. 0021-2010. Passed 2-1-10.) 
1193.02 - DESIGN STANDARDS. 
(a)  Purpose. These standards (1193 & 1195) are to establish stormwater management using best management practices and conservations practices to minimize the impact to public waters from accelerated soil erosion and stormwater runoff caused by earth disturbance activities, subsurface drainage and land use changes connected with activities within a development area, and shall include, at a minimum, all requirements of the OEPA construction general permit for construction activities (CGP). 
(b)  The design standards contained in the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Rainwater and Land Development Manual, latest edition, shall be used to determine the technical acceptability of land development stormwater management methods as applicable and shall be used as technical guidance. The City Engineer shall determine the acceptability of all hydraulic and hydrologic engineering and design. 
(c)  The United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) soil classification mapping of the City shall be used to determine soil classification for the purpose of all stormwater management design unless more detail data is prepared by a competent authority and accepted by the City Engineer. 
(d)  The condition of property prior to earth disturbing activity shall be used to determine predevelopment runoff coefficients and runoff curve numbers based on the most recent NRCS values. 
(Ord. 0021-10. Passed 2-1-10.) 
1193.03 - STORMWATER RUNOFF POLICY. 
(a)  The Stormwater Runoff Policy requires that land uses and developments which increase the runoff rate or volume shall control the discharge rate of runoff prior to its release to off-site land. The purposes of this policy are to: 
(1)  Permit development without increasing the flooding potential of other lands; 
(2)  Reduce damage to receiving streams and impairment of their capacity which may be caused by increases in the quantity and rate of stormwater discharge; and 
(3)  Establish a basis for design of stormwater drainage systems on lands below undeveloped areas which shall preserve the rights and options of both dominant and servient property owners and assure long-term adequacy of storm drainage systems. 
(b)  The Stormwater Runoff Policy applies to all land developments not specifically exempted under Section 1193.04 or granted a waiver as provided by Section 1193.05. 
(c)  Other sections of this chapter specify the performance requirements of on-site drainage systems and runoff control standards. 
(Ord. 0021-2010. Passed 2-1-10.) 
1193.04 - EXEMPTIONS. 
    Exemptions are appropriate for certain land use activities which clearly do not generate significant increases in stormwater runoff. Where exemptions are granted under this section, they shall apply to the requirements for runoff control only and do not in any way imply a relaxation of requirements for adequate and proper on-site drainage or the ability of the system to accept runoff from the tributary land nor a relaxation of any other local, state or federal requirements. The following land uses and developments are exempted from stormwater runoff controls: 
(a)  Land preparation for active agricultural areas, orchards, sod farms and nursery operations; 
(b)  Land grading or leveling for erosion control under direction of the local soil conservation district; 
(c)  Land located within the Regulatory Flood Hazard Area established under Chapter 1191 when developed for permitted or conditional uses defined under Sections 1191.13 and 1191.15. 
(Ord. 0021-2010. Passed 2-1-10.) 
1193.05 - WAIVERS. 
(a)  It is conceivable that development situations not automatically subject to exemptions under Section 1193.04 may exist such that development shall have none of the harmful effects associated with increases in runoff rates and volume. Such developments are eligible for a waiver. The waiver applies only to the requirement that runoff be controlled, and does not in any way imply a relaxation in the requirement for adequate on-site drainage or the ability to accept runoff from land tributary to the development. 
(b)  The waiver application shall request in writing that such requirements for stormwater runoff control be waived. The application shall include sufficient detail to determine that granting a waiver shall not result in increased flooding and that the added volume of runoff shall not damage the receiving stream. 
(c)  A condition of the waiver shall be that any addition, extension or modification of a development for which a waiver has been granted shall be required to provide stormwater runoff control for the entire site if preceding limitations are exceeded by subsequent additions, extensions or modifications. 
(d)  The following land uses and developments are eligible to apply for a waiver on stormwater runoff control requirements contained in this chapter: 
(1)  Development areas abutting and tributary to Big Walnut Creek on which surface watershed flows directly into Big Walnut Creek. 
(e)  All waiver applications shall be recommended by the City Engineer and the Planning Commission and approved by Council. 
(f)  In no case shall a waiver eliminate or replace any other local, state or federal permit or compliance requirements. 
(Ord. 0021-2010. Passed 2-1-10.) 
1193.06 - STORMWATER RUNOFF CONTROL CRITERIA. 
(a)  Stormwater runoff control shall address both peak rate of runoff and total volume of runoff. The peak rate of runoff from an area after development shall not exceed the peak rate of runoff from the same area before development for all return period storms from one year up to a 100-year return period; 24-hour storm. In addition, if it is found a proposed development shall increase the volume of runoff from an area, the peak rate of runoff from certain more frequent storms shall be controlled further. 
    There are two reasons why increases in volume of runoff require a peak runoff control standard more restrictive than controlling to the predevelopment condition. First, increases in volume mean runoff will be flowing for a longer period of time. When routed through a watershed, these longer flows may join at some point or points downstream creating new peak flows and create flooding and erosion and problems associated with increased peak flow. This is known as the "routing problem". Second, longer flow periods of large runoff quantities place a highly erosive stress on natural channels. This stress may be minimized by reducing the rate of discharge. The permissible peak rates shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  Determine the total volume of runoff from a one-year return period, 24-hour storm, occurring over the area before and after development; and 
(2)  Using TR-55 Methodology, or other volume based Methodology acceptable to the City Engineer (the rational method is not acceptable), determine the percentage of increase in volume due to development and using this percentage, pick the critical storm from the following table: 
If the percentage of increase in volume of runoff is: 
Equal to or greater than And less than The critical storm fordischarge limitations shall be (Years) - 10 1 10 20 2 20 50 5 50 100 10 100 250 25 250 500 50 500 - 100  
(b)  The peak rate of runoff from the critical storm occurring over the development shall not exceed the peak rate of runoff from a one-year return period storm occurring over the same area under predevelopment conditions. Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return period) than the critical storm, shall have a peak rate of runoff not greater than the same storm under predevelopment conditions. As an example, if the total volume is to be increased by 35 percent, the critical storm is a five-year storm. The peak rate of runoff for all storms up to this intensity shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak rate of runoff from a one-year return period storm under predevelopment conditions in the area. The runoff from a more intense storm, up to a 100-year return period storm must be controlled so as not to exceed the predevelopment peak rate from the same return period storm. 
(c)  Appropriate stormwater runoff control addresses both peak rate and total volume of runoff. In addition to peak rates of stormwater runoff, methods for minimizing post construction increases in stormwater runoff volumes are strongly encouraged. Methods for reducing runoff volumes may include those listed below. 
(1)  Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction; for example, grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical; discharging roof water into vegetated areas; or grass and rock lined drainage channels; 
(2)  Grading and construction of terraces and diversions to slow runoff and use of grade stabilization structures to provide a level of control in flow paths and stream gradients; 
(3)  Induced infiltration of terraces and diversions to slow runoff and use of grade stabilization structures to provide a level of control in flow paths and stream gradients; 
(4)  Provisions for retention and detention; for example, permanent ponds and lakes with stormwater basins provided with proper drainage, multiple use areas for stormwater detention and recreation, wildlife, transportation, fire protection, aesthetics, or subsurface storage areas. 
(5)  Other methods for controlling post construction water quality as approved by the City Engineer. 
(6)  Attenuation of runoff rates from upstream areas is not required to be provided. Flow from such areas will be routed through the drainage system in the development under consideration at a rate determined in the same manner as the on-site system. Anticipated future development, however, must be considered in the designers' hydrologic analysis. Off-site land uses prior to development, or anticipated to be constructed in the future, shall be considered as the pre-development condition for the purpose of calculating changes in runoff. 
(7)  All stormwater management and sediment control practices shall be designed, constructed and maintained with consideration for the proper control of mosquitoes and other vectors. Practices may include, but are not limited to: 
A.  There should be no depressions in a normally dry detention facility where water might puddle when the water level is receding. Underdrains are encouraged where appropriate. 
B.  All structures shall be designed in accordance with ODNR'S rainwater and land development handbook (most recent edition). 
(d)  Numerous methods of rainfall-runoff computation are available on which the design of storm drainage and flood control system may be based. The rational method, the NRCS hydrologic methods (available in TR-20, TR-55 and HEC-1) are accepted as adequate for determining peak runoff rates for drainage areas. USGS methodologies are also acceptable. Other methods may be accepted with the concurrence of the City Engineer. 
    The total watershed that produces stormwater runoff across the site proposed to be developed shall be included when estimating flood discharge runoff. Dependent on watershed size, the following principal methods shall be considered acceptable to estimate design discharge. 
(1)  For small watersheds of 25 acres or less, the design runoff may be determined by the rational method. This method may also be used for catch basin hydrology. The rational method shall not be used for sizing attenuation basins or any other facility that requires estimation of runoff volumes. 
(2)  For five-100 acres of an urbanizing watershed, the design runoff may be estimated by using the method as Published, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds (TR55). This method may be applicable to areas up to 300 acres depending upon the topography. TR-20 and HEC-1 may be acceptable for larger areas. The designer is encouraged to meet with the City Drainage Engineer prior to selecting a methodology for large watershed. 
(3)  Other method approved by the City Engineer. 
(Ord. 0021-2010. Passed 2-1-10.) 
1193.07 - STORMWATER SYSTEM DESIGN CRITERIA. 
(a)  Design Storms/System Design. 
(1)  Initial drainage system. The initial drainage system is the part of the storm drainage system which is used regularly for collecting, transporting and disposing of stormwater runoff, snowmelt and miscellaneous minor flows. The capacity of the initial drainage system should be equal to the maximum rate of runoff expected from a design storm of established frequency. 
A.  All new storm sewer systems must be adequate to convey anticipated runoff of a watershed from a five-year storm at just full flow. Pressure flows for five year design storms are unacceptable. 
B.  The storm sewer hydraulic grade line shall be determined for the ten-year storm event. The hydraulic grade line at the ten-year storm shall be below the grate and/or cover of all structures. The hydraulic grade line should never be below the normal depth of flow in the conduit. If calculations illustrate this condition, then the designer shall use the normal depth of flow elevation as the hydraulic grade line (HGL) elevation. 
C.  Discharge outlets must be adequate to accept additional runoff from the proposed development without overloading. If the existing outlet is inadequate for such additional flow, an improved outlet or some time-release method of discharge (detention), satisfactory to the City Engineer, must be provided. A tailwater analysis must be completed and used as part of all hydraulic design. 
D.  . Culverts shall be designed to easily convey the ten-year design storm. Headwater depth shall not be within 12 inches of the final pavement (lowest point in road) elevation for the 50-year storm. 
E.  All culverts shall be designed with a uniform barrel cross section throughout their length. Location alignment, material specifications, and end treatments (e.g., headwalls, wingwalls, riprap, apron slabs), shall be approved by the City Engineer. 
(2)  Major drainage system. The major drainage system is that part of the storm drainage system which carries the runoff which exceeds the capacity of the initial drainage system. The major drainage system shall have the capacity to carry runoff from a storm with a return period of not less than 100 years without posing significant threat to property or public safety. 
A.  Major system design shall be considered and accomplished for all development to alleviate potential adverse impact from flooding due to infrequent storms. Sufficient easements shall be provided to protect the major flow paths from being filled, blocked or otherwise disturbed. 
B.  Where a system outlets to an erodible channel, measures shall be taken to lessen potentially destructive velocities. Maximum velocities for discharge into erodible channels shall flow ODOT standards. 
(b)  Initial Storm: Physical Design Criteria for On-Site Improvements. 
(1)  Depth of flow in natural channels shall not exceed bank full stage with backwater effects considered. 
(2)  Depth of flow in artificial channels shall not exceed 0. 8 bank full stage. Velocity of flow shall be determined in accordance with the design criteria for open channels and shall not exceed seven feet per second. Where flows exceed this rate, special channel lining and erosion protection shall be provided. Design approach shall follow the guidelines of the ODNR Rainwater and Land Development Manual. 
(3)  Depth of flow in road side ditch swales shall not exceed one foot or be of such depth that flow would extend out of the right-of-way if the side ditch is less than one foot in depth. Velocity at this depth shall not exceed six feet per second with grass swales or ten feet per second with paved ditches. 
(4)  Depth of flow in streets with curb and gutter shall not exceed the curb height. Velocity of flow in the gutter at design depth shall not exceed ten feet per second. In addition to the above, the following are maximum encroachments of the minimum five-year initial design storm onto the pavement. 
A.  For minor streets carrying traffic from the individual residence to collector and secondary streets, the flow may spread to the crown of the street. 
B.  For collector or secondary streets, one lane shall be free from water. 
C.  For primary streets, one lane in each direction shall be free from water. 
D.  For freeways, no encroachment is allowed on traffic lanes. 
(5)  In the design of the conduit, the conduit may be designed on the basis of flowing full with surcharge to gutter line. Backwater effects shall be considered. 
(c)  Major Storm: Physical Design Criteria for On-Site Improvements. 
(1)  The major storm floodway and floodway fringe for natural streams shall be as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
(2)  Many of the drainageways associated with the major storm system are in areas beyond those designated as floodway or floodway fringe. For these areas, the major storm flood limits shall be determined by the U. S. Corps of Engineers HEC-2 method or other accepted methods of determining water surface profiles using the major design storm runoff. One-half foot elevation shall be added to the flood profile as freeboard for protection in the event of future encroachments into the floodway fringe or in the drainageway. 
(3)  Where the street is designed as the major drainageway, the depth of flow shall not exceed eighteen inches of width at gutter line for local and collector streets and shall not exceed six inches depth at roadway crown for primary streets and freeways. The same maximum depth criteria shall apply where a major drainageway crosses the street. Where a major drainageway is located outside a street, dedicated stormwater easements shall be provided. 
(4)  In determining the required capacity of surface channels and other drainageways provided for the major storm runoff, the street storm inlets and conduit provided for the initial design storm shall be assumed to be carrying not more than one-half their design capacity. This is a safety factor to allow for the surcharged outlets, obstructed inlets or other malfunctions. 
(d)  Stormwater Detention/Retention. Stormwater detention or retention is required for all developers unless a waiver is granted for areas designed for storage of stormwater by detention or retention incorporated into the natural features of the general area. Cooperative planning and joint owner construction of detention discharge control or retention facilities and use of natural land contours is strongly encouraged. No such facilities shall be permitted which may become aesthetically unpleasing, construction or maintenance problems. The City encourages such facilities which are designed as multipurpose spaces such as open space, recreation and/or scenic areas. Detention/retention areas shall also comply with all post construction runoff requirements, including those of the Ohio EPA construction general permit.

1195.04 - SEDIMENT AND EROSION CONTROL STANDARDS AND CRITERIA. 
(a)  In order to control sediment pollution of water resources the owner or person responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and practices to maintain the level of conservation established by the following standards: 
(1)  Timing of sediment-trapping practices. Sediment control practices shall be functional throughout earth-disturbing activity. Settling facilities, perimeter controls and other practices intended to trap sediment shall be implemented as the first step of grading and within seven days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the upslope of a development area is restabilized. 
(2)  Stabilization of denuded areas. Denuded areas shall have soil stabilization applied within seven days if they are to remain dormant for more than 21 days. Areas within 50 feet of a stream must be seeded within three days if they are to remain dormant for more than 21 days. Permanent or temporary soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas within seven days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and shall also be applied within seven days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade, but shall remain dormant (undisturbed) for longer than 21 days. Temporary seeding, and mulching may be disturbed several times during construction, and replacement applications will be required. The design standards contained in the latest edition of ODNR's Rainwater and Land Development Manual shall be used to determine appropriate stabilization specifications and methods. 
(3)  Settling facilities. Concentrated stormwater runoff from denuded areas shall pass through a sediment-settling facility. 
The facility's storage capacity shall be sized per the current requirements of the construction general permit. 
(4)  Sediment barriers. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be filtered or diverted to a settling facility. Sediment barriers such as sediment fence or diversions to settling facilities shall protect adjacent properties and water resources from sediment transported by sheet flow. 
(5)  Storm sewer inlet protection. All storm sewer inlets which accept water runoff from the development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water shall not enter the storm sewer system without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove sediment, unless the storm system drains to a settling facility. 
(6)  Working in or crossing streams. 
A.  Streams including bed and banks shall be restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted or stopped. 
To the extent practicable, construction vehicles shall be kept out of streams. Where in-channel work is necessary, precautions shall be taken to stabilize the work area during construction to minimize erosion. The design standards contained in the latest edition of Ohio Department of Natural Resources' Rainwater and Land Development Manual shall be used to determine appropriate stabilization specifications and methods. 
B.  If a live (wet) stream shall be crossed by construction vehicles regularly during construction, a temporary stream crossing shall be provided. 
(7)  Construction access routes. Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls or onto public roads. 
(8)  Sloughing and dumping. 
A.  No soil, rock, debris or any other material shall be dumped or placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may readily slough, slip or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is authorized by the City Engineer and, when applicable, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges, culverts and erosion control structures. 
B.  Unstable soils prone to slipping or landsliding shall not be graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is done in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's recommendations to correct, eliminate or adequately address the problems. 
(9)  Cut and fill slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and constructed in a manner which shall minimize erosion. Consideration shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, upslope drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization. 
(10)  Stabilization of outfalls and channels. Outfalls and constructed or modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from a post-development, ten-year frequency storm without eroding. 
(11)  Establishment of permanent vegetation . A permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is achieved which, in the opinion of the approving agency, provides adequate cover and is mature enough to control soil erosion satisfactorily and to survive adverse weather conditions. 
(12)  Dewatering. Sediment laden water that is removed from trenches, or other facilities must be directed to a sediment basin, detention/retention pond, or other equally effective sediment control device. Dewatering activities shall not cause turbid discharges to surface waters. At no time can untreated discharge from any sediment laden depression, structural, or non-structural, be pumped directly into a stream, storm sewer inlet, or onto the street. 
(13)  Maintenance. All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices shall be designed and constructed to minimize maintenance requirements and be coordinated with post construction runoff controls. They shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function. The person or entity responsible for the continued maintenance of permanent erosion controls, and assurance of adequate funding, shall be identified to the satisfaction of the plan-approving authority. 
(Ord. 0194-2010. Passed 12-20-10.) 
1195.05 - POST CONSTRUCTION RUNOFF CONTROL. 
(a)  Post-construction runoff controls are permanent controls designed to maintain a receiving stream's characteristics. Owner/developer must provide detailed drawings and maintenance plans for all Post-Construction Best Management Practices (BMPS). Maintenance plans shall also be provided by the permittee to the post-construction operator of the site (including homeowner associations). The permittee, land owner or other entity with legal control over the property shall be required to develop and implement a maintenance plan to comply with local MS4 requirements. The use of innovative and/or emerging stormwater management post-construction technologies shall be at the discretion of the City Engineer and could require monitoring to ensure compliance with OEPA'S Construction General Permit (CGP) Requirements Part III, Section G.2E. The post-construction portion of the stormwater pollution prevention plan shall include the following: 
(1)  Description of post-construction BMPS to be installed during construction, including estimated installation schedule and sequencing plan (including post-construction sediment removal and installation of final outlets). 
(2)  Rationale for selection - to address anticipated downstream impacts (on the channel and floodplain, morphology, hydrology and water quality). 
(3)  Detailed post-construction BMP drawings and specifications. 
(4)  BMP maintenance plan for all BMPS selected and presented to post-construction operator. This maintenance plan shall include a disposal statement for structural BMPS to ensure pollutants collected with structural BMPS are disposed of in accordance with local, state and federal regulations. 
(b)  Post-Construction Runoff Control Design. Selected structural BMPS shall be sized for protection of watercourses from erosion (quantity) and include water quality volumes for controlling sediment volumes. 
    WQv = Volume of runoff from A 0.75 inch rain event 
    WQv is determined according to following method: 
    WQv = C * P * A/12 
    WHERE: 
    WQv = Channel protection and water quality volume in acre-feet 
    C = Runoff coefficient appropriate for storm less than 1 inch. 
    (Table 1195.1 or C = 0.858I 3 - 0.781 2 + 0.774I + 0.04 
The equation being the preferred method) 
    P = 0.75 inch precipitation depth 
    A = Area draining into the BMP in acres 
    I = Watershed imperviousness ratio (percent total impervious divided by 100)

NOTES: 
Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated using a weighted average. 
An additional volume equal to 20 percent of the WQv shall be incorporated into the BMP for sediment storage and/or reduced infiltration capacity during construction. 
BMPS shall be designed such that the drain time is long enough to provide settlement treatment, but short enough to provide storage available for successive rain events as described in Table 1195.2

* Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the permanent pool, each sized for 75 percent WQV. 
(c)  Recommended Post-Construction Best Management Practices. The post-construction best management practice controls in Table 1195.2 are identified in OEPA'S CPG and shall be incorporated in project development and design. 
    The City Engineer will also consider non-structural practices in combination with these structural practices in reviewing site plans. Supporting documentation of non-structural BMP estimated pollutant removal information, map of on-site BMP locations, description of BMP type, and frequency with which the BMPs include: Site impervious area sweeping, natural buffers, pervious pavements, etc. 
    All BMPs shall be designed and constructed per the ODNR Rainwater and Land Development Manual. 
(d)  Post Construction Runoff BMP Drawdown Curve. A drawdown curve (Volume vs. Drawdown Time) shall be calculated and drawn for each BMP and submitted to the City Engineer. 
(e)  Stormwater Control. Ponds are one of the most widely used BMPs for meeting water quantity requirements and providing water quality treatment. The pond improves water quality by detaining stormwater for an extended period of time in a permanent pool to allow pollutants to settle. Pollutants removed include suspended solids, organic matter, dissolved metals, and nutrients. These are enhancements that can be accomplished with ponds to increase the effectiveness of pollutant removal. 
    These enhancements are outlined in ODNR's rainwater and Land Development Manual. Some of them are specifically required by the OEPA's CGP. Both the handbook and manual shall be followed in designing and constructing ponds and other approved BMPs. This chapter includes some of the OEPA requirements and ODNR guidelines, but does not replace those documents. Pond BMPs must specifically follow these guidelines. BMPs other than ponds shall include consideration for all of the below elements and shall address each item to the greatest extent practical. 
(1)  Land area - Land constraints, such as small sites or highly developed areas, may preclude the installation of a pond. The wet pond BMP is most useful for large subdivisions, or development sites. Owners of small properties may cooperatively construct a single large wet pond to serve several sites. Fewer ponds are preferred to numerous individual small ponds. Wet detention ponds are effective in meeting stormwater quantity and water quality (post construction runoff control) goals. Well designed wet ponds can also provide an aesthetic amenity. 
(2)  Soils and minimal water supply - Wet detention ponds must maintain a permanent pool of water. Wet ponds are recommended for medium to large drainage areas (generally greater than ten acres). 
(3)  Retrofit - Wet ponds provide opportunities for retrofit coverage for existing development. With minor excavation and/or modification of the outlet, existing dry ponds can be converted to wet ponds. The retrofits can generate greater water quality benefits for the receiving stream, helping the (community) meet water quality goals. Retrofit opportunities are encouraged in the City of Gahanna. 
(4)  Maintenance - Adequate maintenance access and easements from public or private right-of-way to the basin shall be reserved. The access shall be on a slope of 5:1 (vertical to horizontal) or shallower, stabilized to support heavy construction equipment, and provide direct access to both the forebay and the riser outlet. An adequate area for temporary staging of spoils, prior to ultimate disposal shall be provided. This area shall be protected such that no sediment laden runoff will be directed back into the stormwater management system or onto private property. An easement must be provided over the disposal area. 
(5)  Pond shape and depth - Surface area to volume ratio shall be maximized to the extent feasible. Depths of the permanent pool should be varied and average between three and six feet. A minimum length-to-width ratio of 3:1 should be used unless structural measures are used to extend the flow path. Ponds should be wedge-shaped, narrower at the inlet and wider at the outlet. Irregular shorelines are preferred. A marsh fringe should be established near the inlet or forebay and around at least 50 percent of the pond's perimeter. A shelf, a minimum of four feet wide at a depth of one foot, will surround the interior of the perimeter to provide suitable conditions for the establishment of aquatic vegetation, and to reduce the potential safety hazard to the public. For safety purposes and to minimize erosion, basin side slopes will not be flatter than 20:1, nor steeper than 3:1. Steeper slopes may be allowed if fencing at least five feet in height is provided, although fencing is discouraged for aesthetic reasons. 
(6)  Basin inlet/outlet design . - Velocity dissipation measures shall be incorporated into basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets, and to minimize the resuspension of pollutants. Inverts for inlet pipes shall discharge at the elevation of the permanent pool and perpendicular to the surface to allow the pool to dissipate the energy of the inflow. Stone riprap shall extend from the pipe invert to the pond bottom to prevent erosion. Antiseep collars should be installed on any piping passing through the sides or bottom of the basin to prevent leakage through the embankment. To the extent feasible, the distance between inlet and outlet shall be maximized. The length and depth of the flow path across basins can be maximized by: 
A.  Increasing the length-to-width ratio of the entire design. 
B.  Increasing the dry weather flow path within the system to attain maximum sinuosity. 
(7)  Dual orifices, or other designs should be used to assure an appropriate detention time for all storm events. Where a pipe outlet or orifice plate is to be used to control discharge, it should have a minimum diameter of six inches. If this minimum orifice size permits release rates greater than those specified in these rules, alternative outlet designs will be utilized that incorporate self-cleaning flow restrictors, such as perforated risers, that provide the required release rate. The outlet should be well-protected from clogging. A reverse-slope-submerged orifice or hooded, broad crested weirs are recommended options. If a reverse-slope pipe is used, an adjustable valve may be necessary to regulate flows. Orifices used to maintain a permanent pool level should withdraw water at least one foot below the surface of the water. 
(8)  Backwater (tailwater) on the outlet structure from the downstream drainage system shall be evaluated when designing the outlet. All outlets shall be designed to be easily accessible for heavy equipment required for maintenance purposes. 
(9)  All basins shall include provisions for a defined emergency spillway constructed on undisturbed soil. 
    The emergency spillway should be set at the elevation of the 100-year or more frequent storm. Where feasible, a drain for completely dewatering wet ponds should be installed for sediment removal and other maintenance purposes. 
(10)  Riser design - Hoods or trash racks should be installed on the riser to prevent clogging. Grate openings should be a maximum of three inches. The riser should be placed near or within the embankment, to provide for ready maintenance access. Inlet and outlet barrels and risers should be constructed of materials that will reduce future maintenance requirements. The riser pipe should be a minimum of 24 inches in diameter for riser pipes up to four feet in height. Riser pipes greater than four feet in height should be 48 inches in diameter. Riser pipes shall be constructed with poured-in-place concrete bottoms. 
(11)  The height of water in detention facilities shall not be excessive and shall comply with the ODNR dams and reservoir safety requirements. 
(12)  A table of elevations (stage-storage-discharge table with storage volume and discharge rates) shall be provided with the final engineering and construction plans for all basins. Profile view drawings of the outlet structure, with elevations, shall also be included. 
(13)  Prior to final acceptance of the pond improvements, as-built data shall be submitted to the City Engineer verifying that the structure(s) have been built as designed and will function accordingly. The as-built information shall be prepared and stamped by a registered professional Civil Engineer or a registered Landscape Architect.

(Ord. 0212-2011. Passed 12-19-11.) 
1197.09 - DESIGN REVIEW DISTRICT STANDARDS 
(a)  Olde Gahanna District Except Single-Family Residential (DRD-1). Focused planning objectives enhance exceptional design by establishing the character, form, and shape of both activities and spaces. In the Downtown Mixed Use Neighborhood District, two main planning principles will help to create a reinvigorated central node of community activity. 
(1)  First, the planning emphasis must be to preserve and enhance the environmental quality of existing natural amenities with sensitive design in the Downtown Mixed Use Neighborhood District. 
(2)  Second, this emphasis also extends to the pedestrian. The downtown district must incorporate pedestrian needs into the design process. Olde Gahanna must redevelop so that buildings are grouped to create pedestrian plazas and courts - creating the best environment for the experience of living. 
    Emphasizing the interrelationship of the pedestrian and natural amenities in a development is the hallmark of exceptional design. In Olde Gahanna, this emphasis will coordinate the different design elements weaving them all together into a coherent townscape. 
    Design recommendations encourage and direct a form of development and redevelopment that achieves the physical qualities necessary to maintain and enhance Olde Gahanna's economic vitality and its unique character. Design shall maintain this character by emphasizing historic character, building size and scale relationships, and valued landmarks while encouraging an eclectic creative mix of architecture, outdoor pedestrian spaces, and landscaped areas. All work performed on the exterior of any building within the Olde Gahanna District, excluding single-family, shall follow the requirements of this chapter and Chapter 1150. 
    The following design and planning objectives should guide the creative integration of exceptional design elements into development projects: 
(1)  Focus on Big Walnut Creek: protect, preserve and interrelate development and activities in and around our natural resource, Big Walnut Creek. Link new spaces with the creek using pathways, vistas, open space, and activities. 
(2)  Create an open space framework: create a community gathering space around the creek which has become a new center for Olde Gahanna. 
(3)  Focus on the pedestrian: maintain the priority of the pedestrian space and ensure ease and safety of access and circulation. 
(4)  Create a unique, people oriented setting: New development should create a unique setting focused on people with spaces that invigorate, excite, and invite. This environment will enhance the primary social experience. If successful, all citizens and businesses within Olde Gahanna will profit both in quality of life and economic vitality. 
(5)  Create balance: all land uses, buildings, and pathways will work together as a balanced system. A balanced relationship of building/community elements in harmony with the topographical features of the site creates optimum land use and exceptional design. 
(6)  Be creative and innovative: creative design and innovative planning can empower developers to take full economic advantage of the prestige and marketing power of a recognized vibrant community with a built in market. 
    Criteria for project evaluation: the eventual nature and character of Olde Gahanna will evolve over time and will depend upon the directional input of the City and its project reviews. The following evaluation guidelines are based on quality preferred design relationships and objectives. These guidelines create a clear, concise method of communication with the applicant. This checklist will help to ensure that each project plan submitted will be examined in terms of how it addresses design objectives and how each project plan creatively applies the basic elements of quality design as defined within the Olde Gahanna design guidelines. 
    Along with the following and the requirements stated in Chapter 1150, all development issues in this district shall be subject to guidelines listed in the Olde Gahanna Design Guidelines document. 
(1)  Applications for a certificate of appropriateness in DRD-1 shall be additionally subject to review by the Planning Commission to determine that the project meets the following criteria: 
A.  Community goals: Does the project plan conform with community development goals or master plan. 
B.  Natural features: Does the project plan integrate building's, landscaping, and activities with the site and the surrounding area's natural features and especially Big Walnut Creek. 
C.  Historic preservation: Is the project plan sensitive to historic preservation. (if applicable). 
D.  Context: Does the project plan have good context by successfully relating to and enhancing adjacent structures and open spaces. Does it contribute to the open space framework. 
E.  Balance and creativity: Does the project plan contribute to a creative, eclectic architectural style that is in harmony and balance with its surroundings. 
F.  Pedestrian needs: Is the project plan sensitive to pedestrian needs by encouraging pedestrian safety, activity, and accessibility. 
G.  Unique character: Does the project plan help to create and expand the area's sense of place, reinforce Olde Gahanna's unique character, and enhance its people-oriented setting. 
H.  Facades: Are all visible building facades addressed architecturally and contextually. For projects adjacent to Big Walnut Creek, special emphasis shall be placed on creating people-oriented facades along Big Walnut Creek. 
(2)  Additional requirements are as follows: 
A.  Architecture. 
1.  Purpose and Intent. The architectural design of commercial buildings must create and enhance community image. Scale will play an important role in the creation of pedestrian friendly mixed use development patterns. The "scale" of a building refers to its relationship to other buildings and the street. Scale in this context is a perceived relationship established by the apparent bulk of a building as seen from a public vantage point or abutting property. In most cases, scale is considered to be a product of a building's apparent height and width. The relative nature of this term is important to consider in the approval of architectural design.

1.  Distance. The length from the parking area to the main and auxiliary structures of the development should be a maximum of 400 feet. 
2.  Landscaping. The general layout of the parking area shall integrate a diverse use of vegetation to promote and define patterns of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Curved linear designs should be encouraged to provide a natural and interesting effect to the development. 
3.  Access. Adequate parking should be provided with access to recreational and open space facilities. Sidewalks shall be effectively distributed throughout the development to provide pedestrian access and circulation for the entire development. 
4.  Lighting. Be designed to be on the concerned property and shall be metal halide. The lighting components should be visually interesting and serve not only to illuminate the parking area, but also to enhance the aesthetics of the parking area and the multi-family dwellings. 
(2)  Landscaping. Preserving and enhancing environmentally sensitive areas within the development will be a major consideration and effective landscaping practices should be considered. 
A.  Topography. Areas of development that have significant topographic features such as ravines, lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, creeks, wetlands or woodlands should be preserved to maintain the natural environment within the development. (Refer to Chapter 1167, Preservation Zones of the Codified Ordinances.) 
B.  Aesthetics. Aesthetic, as well as environmental concerns should be addressed to increase and diversify the tax base and preserve the intrinsic value of the area and neighboring properties. 
1.  Vegetation. Generous use of native vegetation such as shade trees and shrubbery is encouraged to promote the rural environment that presently defines the City. 
2.  Natural elements. Whenever possible, screening should be of natural elements such as mounding and vegetation; fences should be avoided. 
3.  Open space. Open space and diverse arrangements of landscaping are issues that should be explored to maintain the rural residential character of the community. 
4.  Signage. Signage shall be as low profile as possible and shall be in conformance with neighboring properties and/or uses. 
C.  Screening. Effective use of natural devices should be employed to minimize the environmental impact of high density multi-family dwelling units and to create a subtle land use transition. Trees, mounding, waterways or a combination of these devices should be used to screen land uses and enhance the appearance of the development. Natural features within the development should be screened to protect the unique attributes of the natural environment from runoff and other externalities associated with high density living conditions. 
(3)  Building materials. The visual effect of the development should complement the surrounding structures. Colors, setting, styles and other physical issues should be addressed to ensure responsible development practices. Protecting property conditions and values creates a higher quality of life and a more valuable tax base for the City. 
A.  Colors. Colors should be of a specific palette that fosters a harmonious relationship with other land uses and structures in the vicinity of the multi-family development. 
1.  Type. Natural, historic, earthtones or similar colors would be least likely to contrast with the existing color scheme. 
2.  Aesthetics. Consideration should be given to the color of existing and surrounding structures and developments. 
B.  Materials. Materials should be of the nature that will enhance the development and existing land values. Bricks, slate, wood, cement, stucco or other materials should provide diversity, but, at the same time, should be consistent with the area that they will be impacting. 
1.  Type. Decorative stone and bricks are preferred, but decorative wood or vinyl siding may be used as long as they are approved by the Planning Commission. 
2.  Other materials. Should be approved by the Planning Commission and be in conformity with existing structures. 
3.  Aesthetics. The existing features of the area and the visual orientation should be complimented by the location and style of new developments; contrast and conflict should be avoided. 
a.  Adjacent buildings and different architectural styles shall be made compatible by such means as screens, sight breaks and materials. 
b.  Exterior lighting shall be part of the architectural landscape and building design. 
c.  All exterior building materials shall be of durable quality. 
(c)  General Commercial, Restricted Institutional (DRD-3). 
(1)  Parking. (Other than Chapter 1163 of the Codified Ordinances.) 
A.  Parking in commercial areas shall add visual interest to the development and enhance the development. 
1.  Distance. The length from the parking area to the main commercial building being serviced by the parking area shall not be greater than 550 feet. 
2.  Access. The entrances and exits from the commercial development should be well decorated and landscaped to minimize unsightly visual appearance of commercial developments but should not obstruct the sight triangle. 
3.  Lighting. The lighting components should be visually interesting and serve not only to illuminate the parking area but, also, to enhance the aesthetic appearance of the parking area and commercial development. Metal halide lighting shall be encouraged. 
4.  Parking areas. Small individual parking areas should be encouraged over large parking areas that serve many. 
5.  Landscape islands. Islands of landscape (grass, trees, shrubs, etc.) shall be in the center and at the perimeter of the commercial development parking areas. (See Chapter 1163 of the Codified Ordinances for interior landscaping requirements.) 
(2)  Screening. Focusing on conflicting land uses and the externalities that are created should be minimized with screening efforts by the developer of the commercial development. 
A.  Natural Elements. Earth mounding and trees should be considered to reduce neighborhood noise that is created by the commercial developments. 
B.  Other devices. Other screening devices may be necessary to protect adjacent property values depending on the development's secondary impacts and should be evaluated by the Planning Commission on a case-by-case basis. 
C.  Vegetation. Generous use of vegetation should be encouraged to produce a natural atmosphere and create a subtle transition of land uses of varying intensities. 
(3)  Landscape. Materials should be indigenous to the climate of Central Ohio and visually separate land uses of conflicting intensities. Visual interest and aesthetic enhancement of the development and its relationship to surrounding properties should be examined to ensure that the landscaping is appropriate for the development. Variety, size, spacing, color and the geographic orientation should be considered during the evaluation to determine the effect on the commercial site. 
(4)  Building Materials. The visual impact of commercial structures and developments is an issue that requires local government to retain some control over the type and style of individual developments. 
A.  Materials. Brick, stone, cement, decorative aluminum, wood, or other materials that will enhance the development in a positive manner and create visual interest and diversity should be encouraged. 
B.  Colors. Specific colors and color schemes should be designed to ensure universal harmony on all commercial developments. 
1.  Quality. Durability and other structural considerations should be given to building materials to ensure that development is of high quality. 
2.  Aesthetics. Orientation of the development should focus on and compliment the surrounding topographic features and existing developments. 
a.  The Planning Commission should determine whether the proposed intensity of use and the visual appearance of this intensity is aesthetically pleasing. 
b.  Lighting devices should be decorative and enhance the commercial development, as well as adequately light the development. 
c.  Signage shall be as low profile as possible and shall be in conformance with neighboring properties and/or uses. 
(d)  Office, Commerce & Technology (DRD-4). 
(1)  Parking. (Other than Chapter 1163 of the Codified Ordinances.) 
A.  Parking in office, commerce and technology developments shall accommodate employees and not degrade the appearance of the development and the general area. 
1.  Distance. The maximum length from the parking area to the main structure should not exceed 600 feet. 
a.  Adequate walkways and landscaped islands should be distributed throughout the office, commerce and technology development. These should emphasize the use of perimeter and central landscape features and easily observe patterns of circulation. 
2.  Lighting. The devices that illuminate the parking area of the office, commerce and technology facility should be of decorative nature to ensure visual interest as well as compliance with lighting requirements. Metal halide lighting shall be encouraged. 
3.  Access. The office, commerce and technology facility should be limited in number of accesses but well defined to all traffic. Use of decorative directional signage should be utilized to minimize problems with vehicular traffic. 
4.  Location. The Planning Commission should be concerned with the location of the proposed parking area and the screening design that will minimize visual contact with the general public. Parking areas should be behind the office, commerce and technology facility. 
(2)  Landscaping and Screening. Integration of natural screening elements should be used to maximize visual interest and foster a natural relationship between the development and the land. (See Chapter 1167 of the Codified Ordinances.) 
A.  Existing Landscaping. The use of large existing trees such as pines, oaks, and maples for landscaping and screening requirements is encouraged. These types of materials should also assist in defining the circulation pattern within the manufacturing development. 
B.  Aesthetics. Ponds or other waterways are encouraged in office, commerce and technology developments to promote aesthetic qualities that otherwise may not be present in the development. Minimizing externalities such as noise, pollution, and refuse that are associated with manufacturing processes should be accomplished to preserve land values and to maintain the aesthetics of the City. More aggressive measures may be required to protect the natural environment from manufacturing facilities. The piping of natural watercourses shall be discouraged. 
(3)  Building Materials. The relationship between the structure and the land is most often defined by the materials used in the development. In order to protect land values of adjoining parcels, explicit materials, colors, styles, etc. should be established to control development. However, since most of this development will occur in the Office, Commerce and Technology District, a more liberal standard may be used to control development. 
A.  Bricks. The types and colors of bricks should be chosen to ensure a harmonious relationship between developments and the environment. Industrial type materials will need to be gathered for this purpose. Examples should be gathered from brick manufacturers and brick distributors in Central Ohio so there is a diverse range of materials for structural design. 
B.  Walls. Stone or cement walls that will enhance the design of the area will be encouraged in developments that have large structures. 
C.  Roofing. Roofing styles which encourage diversity by use of varying angles and peaks is one issue that should be addressed to provide an interesting aesthetic orientation to the development. ECO friendly roofs are encouraged. 
D.  Windows and entryways. Large windows are encouraged in areas where manufacturing processes will allow them. Entryways into the office and reception areas should enhance the visual interest of the development as well as provide direction to visitor areas. 
E.  Screening. The screening of mechanics and/or equipment shall be in accordance with Chapter 1167 of the Codified Ordinances. 
F.  Signage. Signage shall be as low profile as possible and shall be in conformance with neighboring properties and/or uses. 
(e)  Planned Districts (DRD-5). Since the Planning Commission has control of the commercial developments in planned districts, the general commercial requirements outlined for DRD-3 will apply to most developments. However, the Planning Commission may wish to concentrate on demanding more open space and buffer zones between differing land uses. These design attributes should be evaluated by the Planning Commission on a case-by-case basis. 
(f)  Residential Districts with Conditional Uses (DRD-6). 
(1)  Parking. (Other than Chapter 1163 of the Codified Ordinances.) 
A.  Screening- Parking areas for conditional uses should be screened with dense vegetation to minimize visual externalities that may degrade the residential nature of the area. Internal landscaping should be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
1.  Traffic Patterns. Circulation patterns should be established by the use of directional arrows, vegetation, directional signs or other acceptable means. 
2.  Access. Sidewalks to the residential area from the conditional use should be established to incorporate the development into the neighborhood. The pedestrian access should include landscape on the site of development and add to the character of the development. 
(2)  Landscape. Sufficient use of diverse vegetation should incorporate the existing topographic features and the existing residential neighborhood. Trees, shrubs and earth mounds are encouraged to add aesthetic value to the existing community's identity. 
A.  Preservation of existing natural element. Preserving mature foliage and other natural features of the site should be encouraged. Large trees and unique features will add intrinsic value to the development and community in general. 
B.  Aesthetics. Distance, color, and the general landscape orientation of the conditional use should focus primarily on the relationship of the neighborhood and residences. Diversity is encouraged provided that it does not degrade the residential area or environment. Vegetation that is indigenous to Central Ohio is encouraged. 
(3)  Building Materials. Considering the close proximity of conditional uses in residential areas, it is important that the materials used in these types of developments conform to or at least compliment the surrounding community. 
(4)  Signage. Signage shall be as low profile as possible and shall be in conformance with neighboring properties and/or uses.
