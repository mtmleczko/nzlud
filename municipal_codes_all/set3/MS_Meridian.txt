PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Meridian, Mississippi of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1962 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1962 Code, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the twenty-first section of Chapter 15 is 15-21. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-3 and 4-4 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-3.1, 4-3.2 and 4-3.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 7 and 8, it will be designated as Chapter 7.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officers and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully maintaining this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. L. E. Skipper, City Clerk/Director of Administration, Mr. Tom Goldman, City Attorney, and Mr. Larry Primeaux, Assistant City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

The division shall file, or cause to be filed, the petition which shall have attached at least one (1) supporting affidavit from the division and/or the complainant. A copy of the petition with the affidavit(s) shall be served upon the person(s) along with a written notice of the date, time and place for the person(s) to appear to show cause, if any, why an order of abatement should not be entered and why penalties, as hereinafter set forth, should not be assessed.

A copy of the motion shall be served upon the person(s) along with a written notice of the date, time and place for the person(s) to show cause, if any, why an order finding the person(s) in contempt should not be entered and why penalties, as hereinafter set forth, should not be assessed.

In addition to these penalties, the court may impose such other penalties or conditions authorized by law or inherent to the powers of the court for persons found to be in contempt of an order of the court.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 10-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the State of Mississippi has in Sections 21-17-1, 21-19-1 and 21-19-15 of the Mississippi Code of 1972, as amended, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. 3963, § 1, 12-7-93) 
Sec. 10-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 3963, § 2, 12-7-93) 
Sec. 10-3. - Statement of purposes. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities. 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage. 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 3963, § 3, 12-7-93) 
Sec. 10-4. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this chapter are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control project; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
(7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 3963, § 4, 12-7-93)

    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the flood plain. For purposes of this chapter, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as reference for establishing varying elevations within the flood plain. 
    New construction means any structure for which the start of construction commenced on or after December 15, 1977. The term also includes any subsequent improvements to such structure. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational Vehicle means a vehicle which is:

    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the state of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank, or other manmade facilities or infrastructures.

    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, alteration, or improvement to a structure, taking place during a ten-year period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure. The market value of the building should be: 
(1)  The appraised value of the building prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
(2)  In the case of damage, the value of the building prior to the damage occurring. 
    This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purpose of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.

If service of written notice is refused, and the certified mail envelope is returned with an endorsement showing such refusal, or the return of the person serving such notice states that service has been refused, notice shall be deemed complete when the fact of refusal is entered of record. Failure to claim certified mail is not refusal of service. If address is unknown, then service shall be accomplished by notice published once in the newspaper in which the legal notices of the city may be published. 
(d)  Violations; abatement. 
(1)  It shall be the duty of the building official to enforce this section. The building official, on routine inspection or upon receipt of a complaint, may investigate the suspected premises to determine whether to issue the notice provided for hereinabove. Thirty (30) days after service of the notice, the building official shall inspect the premises and conditions in the notice and, if conditions persist, he shall cite the owner or tenant for a violation of subsections (a)-(c) above if found within Lauderdale County and shall apply to the municipal court of the city for an order directing the owner or tenant to show cause at a hearing, in the court why the conditions described in the notice and order should not be abated. The order shall be served upon a suspected violator, wherever he may reside or be found, in the manner provided by subsection 12-64(a), with diligent attempt first made for personal service by any process server, sheriff or his deputy or city officer or other official. This order shall also inform the subject person that the public nuisance, if found by the court to exist, will be abated by city employees and equipment or those of a private contractor and that all costs of the abatement and storage and disposal of any property recovered, including a twenty-five (25) percent penalty will be assessed against the owner or tenant and that in the case of the owner, the land described in the notice will be subject to a lien for the costs and penalty and the same, if unpaid, will result in the land being sold for satisfaction of the lien as is done in the cases of delinquent taxes. The notice shall also inform the subject person that he will be subject to a fine and be assessed court costs if the court finds him guilty of violating this section. 
(2)  Whether or not the person responsible for the offending condition appears, if the municipal court finds that this article has been violated, it shall enter an order of abatement, and, if such abatement is not taken by the person or persons cited or notified, city employees or others under contract with the city shall be authorized to abate the offending items' conditions. 
(3)  Any such personal property coming into the possession and control of the city shall be disposed of in the manner set forth herein. 
a.  The city, upon removing personal property, except motor vehicles as defined by the Mississippi Motor Vehicles Title Law, shall cause to be posted, in three (3) public places in the municipality, notice that such property has been removed. Such notice shall contain an accurate and detailed description of such property and, if the city is advised to who owns such property, a copy of such notice shall be mailed to such person or persons in addition to being posted as herein required. In the case of motor vehicles, as above defined, the last known registered owner and all lienholders of record shall be notified by certified mail of the location of the vehicle and of the fact that if not claimed and all costs of removal, towing and storage are not paid, said vehicle will be sold at a certain date, time and place. The owner of such property may recover the same by filing a claim with the city, establishing his right thereto and paying all costs of removal, towing and storage and a twenty-five (25) percent penalty. The city may require bond of the person claiming the property before delivering same to him. Parties having adverse claims to the property may proceed according to law as now provided by statutes. 
b.  If no person claims the property within ninety (90) days from the date the notice provided for above is given, or within forty (40) days in the case of motor vehicles, the city shall cause the same to be sold at public auction to the highest bidder for cash after first posting notice of such sale in three (3) public places in the municipality at least ten (10) days preceding the date of such sale or, in the case of motor vehicles whose last registered owner or all lienholders cannot be identified and their addresses found, notice of sale shall be made by publication once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in Lauderdale County, Mississippi. If a motor vehicle, as defined or otherwise, has no market value and two (2) automobile dealers make written certification of such fact, the city may dispose of the same at private sale on or after the date of sale duly noticed as otherwise provided herein. The notice shall contain a detailed and accurate description of the property to be sold and shall be addressed to the unknown owners or other persons interested in the property to be sold. The notice shall also set forth the date, time and location such sale is to conducted and shall designate the person who is to make the sale, which person shall be some official designated by the city. 
c.  The person or officer designated and making the sale of such property shall promptly, upon completion of the sale, deliver to the city clerk of the municipality a copy of the notice authorizing the sale, a list of the property sold, the amount paid for each item, the person to whom each item was sold, and all received monies received from such sale, whereupon, the clerk shall deposit the monies in the general fund of the municipality and shall file the information concerning the sale among the other records of this office. In the case of any property against which a lien has been filed, the lien shall be marked "satisfied" to the extent of the net proceeds after any costs of sale, storage accruing after original assessment of the removal, towing and storage plus the twenty-five (25) percent penalty. 
d.  If, within twelve (12) months after date of the sale provided for above, any person, other than the property owner, claims to be the owner of the property sold, the governing authorities shall, upon satisfactory proof of ownership, pay to such persons the net proceeds of the sales price less any removal, towing, storage and sale costs plus the twenty-five (25) percent penalty and the city may require of such person a bonding such cases as they may deem advisable. 
(e)  Anyone who shall violate this section and operation of any abatement order may be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and all costs of court. For conviction of a first offense of violation of subsections (a)-(c) above, any fine assessed under section 12-65, such fine, or any portion thereof, shall be suspended upon condition that the offending items on the private property be removed within fifteen (15) days and the building official certifies such has occurred to the municipal court. 
(Ord. No. 4010, § 14, 4-18-95; Ord. No. 4047, § 1, 4-2-96; Ord. No. 4436, § 1, 5-6-2014)

Secs. 12-66-12-90. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IV. - SMOKE-FREE AIR ORDINANCE 

Sec. 12-91. - Title. 
    This article shall be known as the "City of Meridian Smoke-Free Air Ordinance of 2010." 
(Ord. No. 4365, § 1, 1-19-2010) 
Sec. 12-92. - Findings and intent. 
    Whereas, the city, pursuant to Section 21-17-5 of the Mississippi Code, is authorized to make regulations to secure the general health of the municipality; and 
    Whereas, the city, has the duty to protect and promote the health of its citizenry. 
    Therefore, the City Council of the City of Meridian, Mississippi, does hereby find that: 
Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to sixty-five thousand (65,000) Americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (NCI), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco control Monograph 10," Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI), August 1999.) 
The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen. (Environmental Health Information Service (EHIS), "Environmental tobacco smoke: first listed in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Public Health Service, National Toxicology Program, 2000; reaffirmed by the NTP in subsequent reports on carcinogens, 2003, 2005.) 
Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and cancer. (California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke," Tobacco Control 6(4): 346-353, Winter, 1997.) 
The Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires that disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability. (Daynard, R.A., "Environmental tobacco smoke and the Americans with Disabilities Act," Nonsmokers' Voice 15(1): 8-9.) 
The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke. (Department of Health and Human Services. "The Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking: A Report of the Surgeon General," Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, 1986.) 
The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation. Air cleaners, which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke. (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "Indoor air facts no. 5: environmental tobacco smoke," Washington, D.C.: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), June 1989.) 
A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a twenty-five (25) - fifty (50) percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas, J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., "Association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute coronary syndromes: the CARDIO2000 case-control study," Tobacco Control 11(3): 220-225, September 2002.) 
Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke. ("The high price of cigarette smoking," Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
Numerous economic analyses examining restaurant and hotel receipts and controlling for economic variables have shown either no difference or a positive economic impact after enactment of laws requiring workplaces to be smoke free. Creation of smoke free workplaces is sound economic policy and provides the maximum level of employee health and safety. (Glantz, S.A. & Smith, L. "The effect of ordinances requiring smoke free restaurants on restaurant sales in the United States." American Journal of Public Health, 87:1687-1693, 1997; Colman, R.; Urbonas, C.M., "The economic impact of smoke-free workplaces: an assessment for Nova Scotia, prepared for Tobacco Control unit, Nova Scotia Department of Health," GPI Atlantic, September 2001.) 
Smoking is a potential cause of fires; cigarette and cigar burns and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures causes economic damage to businesses. ("The high price of cigarette smoking," Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
The 2006 U.S. Surgeon General's Report, "The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke," has concluded that: (1) secondhand smoke exposure causes disease and premature death in children and adults who do not smoke; (2) children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory problems, ear infections, and asthma attacks, and that smoking by parents causes respiratory problems and slows lung growth in their children; (3) exposure of adults to secondhand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer; (4) there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke; (5) establishing smoke-free workplaces is the only effective way to ensure that secondhand smoke exposure does not occur in the workplace, because ventilation and other air cleaning technologies cannot completely control for exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke; and (6) evidence from peer-reviewed studies shows that smoke-free policies and laws do not have an adverse economic impact on the hospitality industry. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. "The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and health promotion, Office on Smoking and Health, 2006.) 
Based on a finding by the California Environmental Protection Agency in 2005, the California Air Resources Board has determined that secondhand smoke has serious health effects, including low birth-weight babies; sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); increased respiratory infections in children; asthma in children and adults; lung cancer, sinus cancer, and breast cancer in young, premenopausal women; heart disease; and death. (Appendix II Findings of the Scientific Review Panel: Findings of the Scientific Review Panel on Proposed Identification of Environmental Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant as adopted at the Panel's June 24, 2005, meeting, California Air Resources Board (ARB), September 12, 2005.) There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "Respiratory health effects of passive smoking: lung cancer and other disorders, the report of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 4," Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI); Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), August 1993; California Environmental Protection Agency, "Health Effects of Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke," 1997; California Air Resources Board, "Proposed identification of environmental tobacco smoke as a toxic air contaminant," Sacramento: California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal-EPA), Air Resources Board, Stationary Source Division, Air Quality Measures Branch, Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), September 29, 2005.) 
A study of hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction in Helena, Montana, before, during and after a local law eliminating smoking in workplaces and public places was in effect, has determined that laws to enforce smoke-free workplaces and public places may be associated with a reduction in morbidity from heart disease. (Sargent, Richard P.; Shepard, Robert M.; Glantz, Stanton A., "Reduced incidence of admissions for myocardial infarction associated with public smoking ban: before and after study," British Medical Journal 328: 977-980, April 24, 2004.) 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that the risk of acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease associated with exposure to tobacco smoke is non-linear at low doses, increasing rapidly with relatively small doses such as those received from secondhand smoke or actively smoking one (1) or two (2) cigarettes at day, and has warned that all patients at increased risk of coronary heart disease or with known coronary artery disease should avoid all indoor environments that permit smoking. (Pechacek, Terry F.; Babb, Stephen, "Commentary: How acute and reversible are the cardiovascular risks of secondhand smoke?" British Medical Journal 328: 980-983, April 24, 2004.) 
Given the fact that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) bases its ventilation standards on totally smoke-free environments. ASHRAE has determined that there is currently no air filtration or other ventilation technology that can completely eliminate all the carcinogenic components in secondhand smoke and the health risks caused by secondhand smoke exposure, and recommends that indoor environments be smoke-free in their entirety. (Samet, J.; Bohanon, Jr., H.R.; Coultas, D.B.; Houston, T.P.; Persily, A.K.; Schoen, L.J.; Spengler, J.; Callaway, C.A., "ASHRAE position document on environmental tobacco smoke," American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), 2005.) 
The Society of Actuaries has determined that secondhand smoke costs the U.S. economy roughly $10 billion a year: $5 billion in estimated medical costs associated with secondhand smoke exposure and $4.6 billion in lost productivity. (Behan, D.F.; Eriksen, M.P.; Lin, Y., "Economic Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke," Society of Actuaries, March 31, 2005.) 
    All of the above facts and findings are equally true inside the City of Meridian, Mississippi. 
    Hundreds of communities in the United States, plus numerous states, including California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, New York, and Washington, have enacted laws requiring workplaces, restaurants, bars, and other public places to be smoke-free, as have numerous countries, including Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Sweden, Uganda, and Uruguay. 
    There is no legal or constitutional "right to smoke" and business owners have no legal or constitutional right to expose their employees and customers to the toxic chemicals in secondhand smoke. On the contrary, employers have a common law duty to provide their workers with a workplace that is not unreasonably dangerous. 
    The smoking of tobacco is a form of air pollution, a positive danger to health, and a material public nuisance in the City of Meridian, Mississippi. 
    Accordingly, the City Council of the City of Meridian, Mississippi, finds and declares that the purposes of this article are to: (1) protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; and (2) guarantee the right of all citizens to breathe smoke-free air, and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall outweigh the desire to smoke.

VI, §§ 16-151-16-160 of the Code, which pertained to the nocturnal curfew for minors and derived from Ord. No. 3972, §§ 1-10, adopted June 7, 1994; Ord. No. 3995, §§ 1-10, adopted Nov. 1, 1994; Res. No. 4187, adopted Nov. 15, 1994; and Ord. No. 4016, §§ 1-10, adopted June 20, 1995. Ord. No. 4046, §§ 1-11, enacted new curfew provisions which have been included herein as Ch. 16, Art. VI, §§ 16-151-16-161, at the discretion of the editor. 

Sec. 16-151. - Short title. 
    This article shall be known and may be cited as the curfew ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 4046, § 1, 3-19-96) 
Sec. 16-152. - Purpose and findings. 
    The city council has determined that large numbers of juveniles congregate in the city causing general disturbances to residents, and contributing to an excessive number of incidents of drug and alcohol related crimes, thefts, assaults and homicides including a high percentage of crimes committed by and against juveniles; and 
    The city council finds and determines that special and extenuating circumstances exist within this city that call for special regulation of minors within the city in order to protect them from each other and from other persons on the street during the certain herein specified hours, and to aid in crime prevention, to promote parental supervision and authority over minors and to decrease juvenile crime rates; and 
    In accordance with the prevailing community standards, this article serves to regulate the conduct of juveniles on streets during those certain herein specified hours, to be effectively and consistently enforced for the protection of the juveniles in Meridian from each other and from other persons on the streets during those certain herein specified hours, for the enforcement of parental control of, authority over and responsibility for their children, for the protection of the public from mischief by juveniles, for the reduction in the incidents of juvenile criminal activity, for the furtherance of family responsibility and for the public good, safety and welfare; and 
    After careful review and evaluation of this article, the council finds that there is justification for the purposes and findings herein to enact this article. 
(Ord. No. 4046, § 2, 3-19-96) 
Sec. 16-153. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this article, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meanings given herein. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future, words in the plural number include the singular and words in the singular number include the plural. The word "shall" is always mandatory and not merely directory. 
    Adult is a person eighteen (18) years or older or any person who is legally emancipated. 
    City is the City of Meridian, Mississippi with administrative offices at City Hall, P.O. Box 1430, Meridian Mississippi 39302-1430. 
    Compulsory school age child means a child who has attained or will attain the age of six (6) years on or before September 1 of the calendar year and who has not attained the age of seventeen (17) years on or before September 1 of the calendar year. 
    Minor or juvenile is any unemancipated person under the age of eighteen (18) years. 
    Parent is any person or persons having legal custody of a minor (i) as a natural or adoptive parent; (ii) as a legal guardian; or (iii) as a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of a court. 
    Police Department shall refer to the police department headquarters located at 2415 6th Street, Meridian, Mississippi, or any officially designated precinct of said Department. 
    Remain means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets, including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four (4) or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home. The numerous exemptions expressly defined in section 16-154 demonstrates that this article is not a mere prohibitory or presence type curfew ordinance. 
    Street is a way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter or right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case of time, whether central standard time or central daylight savings time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the city, prima facie the time when observed in the city administrative office and police department. 
    Year of age continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth, to (but not including the day of) the next, making it clear that seventeen (17) or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase "under eighteen (18) years of age", unless specifically defined differently herein. 
(Ord. No. 4046, § 3, 3-19-96) 
Sec. 16-154. - Restrictions. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any minor under eighteen (18) years of age to retain in or upon any public street, highway, park, vacant lot or other public place within the city between those hours beginning at 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. next following, Sundays through Thursdays, and between those hours beginning at 12:00 a.m. (midnight) on Fridays to 6:00 a.m. next following, and beginning at 12:00 a.m. (midnight) on Saturdays to 6:00 a.m. next following. 
(b)  It shall also be unlawful for any compulsory school age child to remain in or upon any public street, highway, park, vacant lot or other place within the city during the following period: 
(1)  8:45 a.m. until 2:45 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, and from 8:45 a.m. until 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday, during the school term in which [a] compulsory school age child is to be enrolled in a public or private legitimate non-public school, as required by the Mississippi Compulsory School Attendance Law (Section 37-13-19). 
(2)  Notwithstanding subsection (b)(1) above, beginning with the last stated day of the school term, the hours of curfew for subsection (a) above will be from 12:00 a.m. (midnight) to 6:00 a.m. next following on Sundays through Saturdays and shall so remain until the beginning of the next regular school term at which time the hours of curfew set forth in subsection (a) above shall again be applicable. 
(3)  Not withstanding subsection (b)(1) above, beginning with the last stated day of the school term, the hours of curfew stated therein will be suspended until the beginning of the next regular school term, at which time these stated hours shall again be applicable. 
(c)  It shall further be unlawful for a parent or a minor to knowingly permit or by inefficient control to allow such minor to be or remain upon any city street under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of this article. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense, that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor child. 
(Ord. No. 4046, § 4, 3-19-96) 
Sec. 16-155. - Exceptions. 
    The following shall constitute the valid exceptions to the operation of the curfew. 
(1)  At any time, if a minor is accompanied by his or her parent; or, 
(2)  When a minor is accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to take said parent's place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area; or, 
(3)  If the minor is legally employed, for the period from forty-five minutes before to forty-five minutes after work, while going directly between his or her home and place of employment. This exception shall also apply if the minor is in a public place during curfew hours in the course of his or her employment. To come within this exception, the minor must be carrying a written statement of employment issued by employer, pursuant to the authorization of the chief of police, to expire within ninety (90) days; or, 
(4)  If a minor is on the property of or the sidewalk directly adjacent to the place where such minor resides, or the place immediately adjacent thereto, if the owner of the adjacent property does not communicate an objection to the minor and the police officer; or, 
(5)  When returning home by a direct route from (and within thirty (30) minutes of the termination of) a school activity or an activity of a religious or other voluntary association, or a place of public entertainment. This exception shall not apply beyond 1:30 a.m. If the event is not commercial in nature or does not have a fixed, publicly known time at which it will or does end, the sponsoring organization must register the event with the chief of police (or his assigned representative) at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance, informing the police department of the time such event is scheduled to begin, the place at which it shall be held, the time at which it shall end and the name of the sponsoring organization and the name, address and telephone number of a person whom the police department may contact with regards to the event; or 
(6)  In the case of reasonable necessity, but only after such minor's parent has communicated to the police department personnel the facts establishing such reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated time for a described purpose including place of origin and destination. A copy of such communication, or the police record thereof, duly certified by the chief of police to be correct, an appropriate notation of the time it was received and of the names and addresses of such parent and minor shall constitute evidence of qualification under this exception; or, 
(7)  When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right of assembly. Such minor shall provide bona fide evidence of such exercise and provide notice to city officials by first delivering to the Police Department a written communication, signed by such minor, with their home address and telephone number, addressed to the mayor of the city specifying when, where and in what manner said minor will be on the streets at night (during hours when the curfew ordinance [is] to still otherwise be applicable to said minor) in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such communication. Said notice must be received a minimum of 24 hours prior to the intended exercise of First Amendment rights and shall be subject to the same requirements and restrictions as the current policy and procedure applicable to parade permits; or 
(8)  When a minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle engaged in bona fide interstate travel through the city, particularly on Interstates 59 and 20 and all access roads to these interstate systems. This also exempts all interstate travel beginning or ending in the City of Meridian; and 
(9)  Any exception set forth in the text of the Mississippi Compulsory School Attendance Law, Section 37-13-91. 
    Each of the foregoing exceptions, and their several limitations, such as provisions for notification, are severable, as hereinafter provided, but here re-emphasized. 
(Ord. No. 4046, § 5, 3-19-96) 
Sec. 16-156. - Violations. 
(a)  A police officer of the city who has probable cause to believe that a minor is in violation of this article shall transport the minor to the police department. 
    When a minor is taken to the police department, the minor's parents shall be immediately contacted. If after this contact there is still probable cause to believe that the minor was violating this article, the minor shall be held until the parent comes to take the minor home. When the parent arrives, he or she shall be given a copy of this article. If no parent has arrived within two (2) hours, the minor shall be turned over to custody of the local juvenile authorities until a parent can take custody of him or her, and the chief of police shall, by certified mail, send to the minor's parent written notice of said violation and a copy of this article. Said notice shall be sent to the minor's parent at his or her last known address and evidence of its mailing as specified shall constitute sufficient notice of the minor's violation. 
(b)  (1)  If, after the warning notice as set forth in subsection 16-156(a) herein is delivered to the parent, there is a second violation of this article by the minor, the parent of the minor will be held to have violated subsection 16-154(b) in connection with the second violation by the minor, and this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. For such first parental offense, a parent shall be fined twenty-five dollars ($25.00). For each subsequent offense, the fine shall be increased by a doubling factor, fifty dollars ($50.00) for second, one hundred dollars ($100.00) for third, two hundred dollars ($200.00) for fourth offense, etc. 
(2)  In addition to the fine set forth in subsection (b)(1), each minor shall be sentenced to perform community service work for each third and additional violation. The court, in its discretion, may require each parent to perform community service work, with due regard given for age and health considerations, for each third and subsequent violation. 
(c)  Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of this article more than one (1) time shall be dealt with according to the youth court law of the State of Mississippi and in accordance with the directives of the youth court of Lauderdale County, Mississippi, or other court as shall have jurisdiction of said minor. 
(Ord. No. 4046, § 6, 3-19-96) 
Sec. 16-157. - Construction and Severability. 
    Severability is intended through and within the provisions of this article. If any provision, including inter alia, any exception, part, phrase, or term of, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the application of other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and the validity of this article in any and all other respects shall not be affected thereby. The council does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible to execute or unreasonable. It is intended that this article be held inapplicable in such cases, if any, where its application would be unconstitutional. A constitutional construction is intended and shall be given. The council does not intend to violate the Constitution of the State of Mississippi or the Constitution of the United States of America.

(2)  After receipt of the police chief's report, the clerk of the council shall place this matter on the city council agenda for discussion, review and continuing its evaluation.

Sec. 16-182. - Findings and intent. 
    The Meridian City Council does hereby find as follows: 
    Smoking on any trail within the Bonita Lakes Watershed presents a significant and unacceptable fire hazard; and 
    Many visitors to the Bonita Lakes Watershed patron this location for the purpose of pursuing health related activities such as walking, jogging and hiking; and 
    Smoking, even in outdoor locations, is inconsistent with health related physical fitness activities; and 
    In order to facilitate the safety, health and enjoyment of individuals at Bonita Lakes, a smoke free environment should be maintained on all trails located on the Bonita Lakes Watershed; and 
    The litter associated with smoking is inconsistent with the natural beauty and attractiveness of the Bonita Lakes Watershed; and 
    The Meridian City Council finds and declares that the purposes of this article are (1) to protect the public health, safety and welfare by prohibiting smoking and the related fire hazard on all trails at Bonita Lakes Watershed on property owned by the City of Meridian; (2) to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smokefree air; and (3) to assist in maintaining litter free conditions at Bonita Lakes. 
    Smoking shall be prohibited in all areas whether open or enclosed which are located on any portion of any trail located at the Bonita Lakes Watershed and owned by the City of Meridian, and that a "trail" is defined for purposes of this provision as an improved or unimproved path designed for the movement of pedestrian traffic, including jogging paths, equestrian traffic, or off-road vehicles, but shall not include golf-cart paths at the municipal golf course. 
(Ord. No. 4266, 4-5-2005)

(b)  Notice of the provisions of this article shall be posted at the main entrance to the Bonita Lakes Watershed located adjacent to Highway 19 South. 
(c)  A person who smokes in an area where smoking is prohibited by the provisions of this article shall be guilty of an infraction, punishable by a fine not exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) for each separate occurrence.

(2)  A public hearing will be had, after notice, specifying the boundaries of any proposed historic preservation district historic landmarks and landmark sites. Such notice shall be published once a week for at least three (3) consecutive weeks in at least one (1) newspaper published in the city. The first publication of such resolution shall be made not less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date fixed in such resolution for the public hearing, and the last publication shall be made not more than seven (7) days prior to such date;

If in private ownership, a landmark site must include significant surviving landscape features to qualify for designation unless its primary significance is archeological, and new construction after review and approval, shall be built to fit into such landscape features rather than replace them or shall be designed to avoid insofar as possible an archeological resource rather than replace it. If in public ownership, the commission shall discourage new construction on a site of great significance to the entire community unless the new construction can be located on a portion of the site which will permit a continuing understanding of its historical character and will avoid damage to surviving landscape features or an archeological resource. 
(b)  Once a nomination has been filed with the commission to designate one (1) or more local properties, a decision on whether to proceed with the designation must be made within six (6) months. A majority of the commission's members must vote in favor of any proposed designation in order for the file supporting the designation to be sent forward to the city council for its consideration. 
(c)  No file purporting to justify a proposed designation may be forwarded to the city council unless the commission's recommendation includes a map that clearly delineates boundaries for the proposed designation, a verbal description and justification of the proposed boundaries and a written statement of significance for the historic district or landmark or landmark site proposed for designation. 
(d)  The commission must notify, as quickly as reasonably possible, other municipal agencies and any appropriate county or state agencies of the designation of a historic district, landmark or landmark site. The commission must maintain in its official files an updated list and map of local designations and provide copies of such a map to other governmental agencies within one (1) week of the preparation of a new version of the map.

(b)  A historic property designated by ordinance as herein provided may be demolished only after one hundred eighty (180) days' written notice of the owner's proposed action has been given to the commission.

The commission may enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange or otherwise of the property or any interest therein. 
(c)  The commission may reduce the waiting period required by this section in any case where it has found reasonable cause for such reduction and said cause is made into record. If a property in a historic district or a historic landmark or landmark site is demolished without review and approval by the commission, the governing authority may require that the owner rebuild on the site using as much of the original building material as possible, but in general following the same form. Unauthorized demolition of a portion of a structure shall not serve as justification for a demolition permit whenever it can be shown that restoration or rehabilitation would still be feasible. 
(d)  Whenever a structure or structures is demolished without review and approval by the commission, the governing authority may require that no permit shall be issued for any structure or structures proposed for the same parcel which would require a footprint larger than the footprint of the demolished structure or structures.

(c)  If the work to rectify has not commenced by the thirtieth day, the commission shall again notify the record owner or owners to appear at the next meeting of the commission. If, after reviewing the facts of the case, the commission determines that the historic property is being "demolished by neglect" and that insufficient efforts are being made to preserve the resource, then it shall, through the appropriate officer or agency of the city, bring charges against the owner or owners for the violation of this article. 
(d)  In addition to the powers specified in MS Law Section 21-19-11(1) for cleaning private property, the city, with concurrence by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, may make repairs necessary to correct demolition by neglect and the cost of such repairs shall become a lien against the property in accordance with MS Law Section 21-19-11(3).

Sec. 20-91. - General purposes and intent. 
    The general purposes and intent of the city in adoption of this official major street plan are as follows: 
(1)  To provide a convenient and adequate major street network to meet the needs of residential, commercial, and industrial traffic within the city, and to facilitate flow of traffic through and around the city; 
(2)  To reduce the use of minor streets for through traffic, thus contributing to the safety and comfort of dwellers along such minor streets; 
(3)  To give assurance and guidance as to intent concerning location of major streets in order that developers, residents, and commercial and industrial interests may be informed thereby; 
(4)  To provide a basis for city programs for right-of-way acquisition, and for design and construction appropriate to such streets; and 
(5)  To guide planning and control of land use along such streets in order to minimize potential marginal interference with free traffic flow, and to protect the uses along such streets from potential damaging effects of concentrated traffic flow. 
(Ord. No. 3901, § 1, 1-8-91) 
Sec. 20-92. - Existing and proposed streets designated as arterial or collector streets. 
    The following existing or proposed streets, or portions of existing or proposed streets, are hereby declared to comprise the major street plan for the city, and designated as arterial or collector streets as follows: 
(1)  Arterial streets. Arterial streets are hereby defined as a class of streets that carry relatively large volumes of through traffic from local and collector streets and conduct it to and from the various traffic focal points in the city. Arterials interconnect the principal traffic generators within the city as well as important rural routes. A secondary function of arterials is to provide access to abutting properties. The length of a typical trip on the system should exceed one (1) mile, and arterials generally should be spaced about one (1) mile apart. Major arterials are designed for the traffic volumes they carry, while minor arterials are underdesigned for the traffic volumes they carry and require improvement. The major streets designated as major and minor arterials are listed below:

Subdivisions shall be designed in accordance with standards established in chapter 10 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Meridian. 
(Ord. No. 3938, § 1, 7-7-92) 
Sec. 21-42. - Street arrangement. 
    Provision will be made for the extension of any existing dead-end streets (as distinguished from a cul-de-sac) whenever possible. Off-center street intersections should have an offset of a minimum of one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet (center line offset). Streets with reverse curves must conform to the existing topography as nearly as possible in order that drainage problems may be reduced. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than seventy-five (75) degrees unless approved by the department of community development. 
(Ord. No. 3938, § 1, 7-7-92) 
Sec. 21-43. - Relation to adjoining streets.

(c)  The streets shall be at least as wide as the pre-existing streets to which they relate and shall be situated in such a way as to accommodate rational future access and street patterns. 
(d)  All streets shall be properly integrated and coordinated with existing streets, and the proposed system of streets within and contiguous to the subdivision, and dedicated rights-of-way as established in the comprehensive plan. 
(e)  Such proposed street rights-of-way shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless in the opinion of community development such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts. 
(f)  The necessary rights-of-way for stub streets to provide adequate access to adjacent property or utility easements to provide utility service shall be dedicated at the time a subdivision is recorded. When the adjacent property is developed, the developer of such property shall connect and construct all stub streets and extend utility service to connect with the adjacent subdivision to public works standards. 
(g)  Stub roads in multi-staged subdivisions: In any subdivision recorded or built in sections, all stub streets or utilities in a section designed to serve property in the subdivision but to be developed in a later section shall be constructed at the time other streets or utilities in that section are constructed. 
(h)  Temporary turnarounds and reversion of excess ROW to abutting lots: A temporary T or L shaped turnaround shall be provided on all temporary dead-end (stub) streets, with the notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street ROW shall revert to abutters whenever the street is continued.

(i)  Developer of future tract constructs streets in existing subdivision stub streets: Where appropriate, stub streets shall be reserved for future street usage in conjunction with the development of adjacent tracts. Stub streets reserved for future street usage will not be required to be improved unless lots are platted that front on such stub streets. Otherwise, these areas shall be reserved for street improvements to be provided by the developer of the adjacent tract. In situations where completion of improvements are not required, the stub street shall be graded and laid-out in anticipation of future improvements. 
    Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted area reserved for future street usage adjacent to the boundary of a tract being developed, such street shall be extended into the proposed development provided this use is not adverse to the manmade or natural features of the site. 
(j)  Drainage, barricades and traffic control on stub streets: 
(1)  Proper provision shall be made for adequate storm drainage at the ends of dead end streets. 
(2)  Appropriate barricades and other traffic controls shall be installed by the developer at dead ends, in accordance with city codes. 
(k)  No landlocked parcels: A tract shall be subdivided so that no remnants or land-locked spaces without access to the vehicular/pedestrian circulation system, will ultimately remain. 
(l)  Minimum length of stub streets to require a turnaround: Dead end streets having a length greater than two hundred (200) feet shall be provided with a temporary turnaround of either a circular or back-and-turn design. 
(m)  Cul-de-sacs may be permitted where a vehicular connection to other streets is not essential. Such cul-de-sacs shall provide access to all lots and a turnaround shall be provided at the closed end. The turnarounds on cul-de-sacs up to six hundred sixty (660) feet long shall have an outside paved street radius of at least forty (40) feet and a street property line radius of at least fifty (50) feet provided parking on the street is prohibited.

Secs. 21-52-21-60. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IV. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS 

Sec. 21-61. - Generally; installation of improvements. 
    The subdivider of land within the city shall be required to install or otherwise provide for improvements within the subdivision as required for development. If, however, public works, in anticipation of development outside the boundaries of a proposed subdivision, finds that the water, sewer and/or transportation needs of said development will be best served by the use of such improvements through all or any portion of said subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to construct such improvements in said subdivision of adequate size to service said outside development. In such cases the city will pay the difference in actual cost of materials (specifically excluding the costs of rights-of-way and easements) between that approved for the developer and that required by the city. The amount of the difference shall be determined by the city council, prior to the planning commission's acceptance of the preliminary plat of said subdivision. 
    Improvements shall not be installed prior to proper endorsement by the city council. The proper installation of such improvements, other than those by a private utility company, shall be assured by provision of an improvement guarantee as required by this article. All improvements installed by the developer shall comply with public works specifications and standards. The subdivider shall provide laboratory testing as specified by public works throughout construction. 
    In a new residential subdivision the city may provide water and sewer improvements (water lines, sewer lines and fire hydrants) on public property, but not lift stations, force mains, water meters, meter boxes, water and sewer taps. The extent, timing and provisions for those water and sewer improvements will be under the supervision of public works, and must be first approved by public works. The design of all such improvements, including those that the city may provide, will be the responsibility of the developer, but are subject to approval by the public works. The city may issue water and sewer revenue bonds, if required, to provide such water and sewer improvements. The value of the improvements provided by the city on public property will be made available to the developer based upon approval of the developer's construction plan, in an amount not to exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the total value of eligible water and sewer infrastructure per subdivision; however, where the new improvement (house) sells for one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000.00) or less, the value percent increases to thirty (30) percent. This incentive applies only to a developer who selects Option 1 in section 21-69, improvement guarantees. To the extent that the law will permit the city so to do, property taxes on subdivided property will not be increased until after the improvement (house) has been completed and community development has issued a certificate of occupancy for such house. 
(Ord. No. 3938, § 1, 7-7-92; Ord. No. 4189, § 1, 9-4-2001; Admin. Inter. 9-11-2001; Ord. No. 4301, 12-19-2006)

Sec. 21-63. - Monuments. 
    Concrete markers shall be placed at all block corners. Monuments shall be a 5/8 x 2' iron pin set in concrete to identify points of intersection. An iron pin marker shall be placed at all lot corners and points of curvature and points of tangency. 
(Ord. No. 3938, § 1, 7-7-92) 
Sec. 21-64. - Streets. 
(a)  All streets in the subdivision other than those providing access to adjourning undeveloped properties shall be paved. Only rough grading may take place within a street right-of-way until construction plans have been approved by public works. All street construction shall conform to specifications and standards of the city and compliance therewith shall be confirmed by public works prior to release of improvement guaranty by the city council. Streets may be built with either curb and gutter or open ditches. If curb and gutter are constructed, then the curbs must be constructed of concrete and inlets and storm drains installed as approved by public works. All subdivisions will contain side walks built to city specifications. 
(b)  Private streets: Private streets are allowed only in limited situations: in planned unit developments or in large lot developments having at least two (2) acre lots, or in other special situations, subject to the approval of public works and city council. They must be shown on plats as "private streets". Water meters will be placed at the public right-of-way. Sewer connections will also be made at the public right-of-way. Private streets cannot be through streets and they cannot serve as stub streets or half streets for future land divisions on abutting tracts. However, private streets must be built to a level of service sufficient for access by emergency and service vehicles at all times. Private streets must provide unrestricted access to all lots and uses served. Turnarounds at the ends of private streets must also be provided. Finally, the developer must provide public works with a copy of an agreement indicating how the street will be maintained and who is responsible for the maintenance. 
(Ord. No. 3938, § 1, 7-7-92; Ord. No. 4301, 12-19-2006; Ord. No. 4434, § 1 (Att. A), 4-15-2014) 
Sec. 21-65. - Storm drainage. 
    The subdivider shall install culverts, storm sewers, stabilized ditches and other improvements to adequately handle stormwater. All improvements shall comply with public works minimum standards and shall be approved by public works prior to construction. 
(1)  The horizontal and vertical alignment of streets shall be compatible with the storm water runoff system and drainage design. 
(2)  Street grades shall be coordinated with lot drainage as proposed in the grading plan. 
(3)  The hydraulic capacity of the curb and gutter shall be determined by accepted engineering practices taking into consideration roughness, street cross-slope, and street gradient, and allowable spread of water over the travel lane. 
(4)  The hydraulic capacity of curb inlets shall be determined by accepted engineering procedure taking into consideration inlet geometry and characteristics of the gutter flow. Curb inlets shall be spaced so as to limit the spread of water to not more than one (1) quarter of the street width during a design storm of five-year return period and fifteen (15) minute duration. Inlets shall also be located at all low points in the gutter grade, to prevent gutter flow from crossing traffic lanes of an intersecting street, or at points of special concern as designated by public works. All cross drain culverts shall be of reinforced concrete unless otherwise approved by public works. Other culvert materials approved by the state highway department may be used for all other applications except cross drains. 
(5)  Site drainage system to tie to community drainage system. 
(6)  Tracts and lots to reduce on-site excess runoff: Lots shall be developed to maximize the amount of natural drainage which is percolated into the soil and to minimize direct overland runoff into adjoining street and water courses. Stormwater runoff from roofs and other impervious surfaces should be diverted into swales or terraces on the lot when possible to slow down water flow and increase absorption. 
(7)  On-site retention basin may be required. 
(8)  Shoreline and stream bank protection: A buffer yard of fifteen (15) feet is required between the top of a stream bank and any structure, other than boat landings, docks, bridges, and pumping or water treatment facilities. The above width of the buffer yard may be modified at the discretion of public works. 
(Ord. No. 3938, § 1, 7-7-92; Ord. No. 4301, 12-19-2006) 
Sec. 21-66. - Erosion control. 
    Erosion control means the subdivider shall provide erosion control on all disturbed areas within the subdivision as required by public works. 
(Ord. No. 3938, § 1, 7-7-92; Ord. No. 4301, 12-19-2006)

No person, firm or corporation now licensed by the city as a taxicab business or a company hereafter granted a certificate of convenience and necessity for such operation shall fix or charge a greater or lower fare than those established by the city council effective May 1, 1991. 
    No additional charge shall be made for the second passenger on any trip going to the same destination but an additional fifty cents ($0.50) shall be added for each passenger over two (2). For each piece of baggage over three (3) pieces there may be an additional charge of fifty cents ($0.50) 
    No charge shall be made for time lost or for inefficiency or breakdown of the taxicab or for time consumed by premature response to a call. The charges fixed above shall cover all luggage transported. 
(d)  Charges to be fixed by taximeter only. All charges for transportation of passengers in taxicabs operated in the city, except when hired on a per-hour basis or under private long-term contract, must be based on the charges indicated on such taximeters. No owner, taxidriver or operator of any taxicab shall charge any passenger or passengers any sum in excess of or less than the sum indicated on such taximeter, however, any voluntary discounts to the elderly and handicapped shall be posted in a prominent place on the inside of the taxicab so as to be immediately visible to passengers therein. 
(e)  Display of taximeter flag. Taximeters installed under this section shall indicate the charge by means of legible figures which are electronically lighted each time the taximeter flag is thrown from a nonearning or an earning position. At all times, while the taxicab is engaged, the flag of the taximeter shall be thrown into position to register charges for mileage or into position to register charges for waiting time. It shall be unlawful for any taxidriver while carrying passengers to display the flag attached to the taximeter in such a position as to denote that such vehicle is unemployed or to fail to throw the flag of the taximeter to a position indicating that such vehicle is employed at the termination of each and every service. The flag shall not be changed to the non-earning position until after the fare is paid. 
(f)  Operation of taximeter when vehicle not employed. No taxidriver while transporting for hire shall display the taximeter flag in any position other than the position recording a fare, and no taxidriver, unless carrying passengers or parcels for hire, shall operate such vehicle unless the taximeter flag is in an upright position indicating that the cab is not engaged or hired. If the vehicle is occupied by more than one (1) passenger and they are not to be discharged at the same destination, the first passenger leaving the vehicle shall be chargeable for the amount of fare shown on the taximeter and before proceeding to transport the remaining passenger or passengers to his or their destination the flag shall again be placed in earning position so as to designate the beginning of a new and separate trip as to the remaining passenger or passengers in such taxicab and such process shall be repeated each time a passenger reaches his destination and alights from the vehicle so that the remaining passenger or passengers leaving the vehicle shall be chargeable with such fare appearing upon the taximeter upon leaving the taxicab. 
(g)  Tampering with taximeter. Tampering with a taximeter so as to cause an inaccurate reading of the fare shall be a misdemeanor and subject any holder or taxidriver to revocation, respectively, of the certificate or permit.

Sec. 25-3. - Right of employees to inspect water installations; discontinuing service for violation of regulations. 
(a)  Any employee of the public works department, at the time of turning on water to any consumer, shall watch the meter to determine the possibility of an opening in any line, e.g., broken line, faucet turned on, or any indication from the meter that an unusual amount of water is passing through the meter under the circumstances. If it appears that an unusual amount of water is passing through the meter, the employee may conduct a visual inspection of the premises outside any building to look for evidence of water leakage without permission from the consumer or owner if different from the consumer; provided, however, the employee shall not enter into or upon any buildings or structures. If such evidence is found and the employee can correct it, e.g., turning off an outside faucet, the employee shall do so. If such evidence is found, e.g., water from a broken line or coming from under a structure, and the cause cannot be corrected by the employee, the water shall be turned off and a report immediately made to the public works department who shall notify the consumer as quickly as possible. 
(b)  In other situations, after giving reasonable notice under the circumstances to the consumer and owner of the premises, if different from the consumer, the director or other duly authorized personnel of the public works department, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall have free access at any reasonable hour to all parts of the premises supplied with water from the waterworks system of the city for the purpose of examining into the conditions or uses of water on the premises as may be reasonable or necessary to determine whether conditions exist which may impair or threaten the safety, integrity or quality of the water system itself or the water provided by the city, or to determine whether conditions exist which may threaten or endanger the safety, health and welfare of any consumers of the system including, but not limited to, the uses to which the water is applied, the condition of fixtures, service pipe installations and other equipment, presence of lead, copper, chlorine or other pollutants or to investigate or respond to any report or complaint from a consumer. 
(c)  Refusal to allow inspection may immediately be followed by a discontinuance of the water supply which shall not be restored, if discontinued, until inspection is allowed and proper damages paid. Should it be found that the water is being used contrary to the rules, rates and regulations or provisions of this chapter, the supply may be shut off and not restored until a proper accounting has been made and all claims paid. 
(d)  The person making the inspection shall prepare a concise written report of each inspection containing, as a minimum: 
(1)  The basis for determining the need for the inspection; 
(2)  Notice given or efforts made to give notice; 
(3)  The date and time of the inspection; 
(4)  The findings of the inspection; 
(5)  The other persons present, if any, during the inspection; and 
(6)  The conclusions and recommendations for action, if any.

The following minimum guidelines will be used in determining payment arrangements, if any: (a) length of time account has been established, (b) date of last payment, and (c) payment history. Any member of the department's business office staff is authorized to enter into a "hold" agreement for accounts up to seventy-five dollars ($75.00) and up to ten (10) days past the due date. Any request for the extension of such an agreement past the initial ten-day period or respecting an amount in excess of seventy-five dollars ($75.00), must receive prior approval by the director or his designee.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Mississippi has in Title 17, Chapter 1, Section 17-1-1 through 17-1-27 of the Mississippi Code, annotated, 1972, as amended, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt land use and development regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of its citizens. 
Sec. 2. - Title and short title. 
    This ordinance shall be known as the "Official Zoning Ordinance of the City of Meridian, Mississippi", and may be so cited, and further referenced elsewhere as "Zoning Ordinance", and herein as "the ordinance" or "this ordinance", shall imply the same wording and meaning as the full title. 
Sec. 3. - Statement of purpose. 
    The general purpose and intent of this ordinance shall be the attainment of the goals and objectives of the people of the City of Meridian, Mississippi, expressed in the comprehensive plan of the city, through provisions of this ordinance, and to the degree that such attainment may be accomplished. Also, it shall be the intent of this ordinance that its interpretation and application be as helpful and permissive as possible toward the attainment of said goals and objectives, but within the provisions of the regulations stated herein. 
Sec. 4. - Findings of fact. 
4.01.  The governing authorities of the City of Meridian [City Council] and the Meridian Planning Commission [the Commission] are committed to a sound, reasonable, continuous, comprehensive planning process to implement the Meridian Comprehensive Plan and promote the goals and objectives of said plan. The plan's purpose is to promote the health, safety, morals, convenience, environment, and general welfare of its citizens and provide coordinated and efficient government actions, economic diversification and protection of the environment and aesthetics of the city. 
4.02.  The Commission has provided for land subdivision and has divided the incorporated area of the city into zoning districts in accordance with a comprehensive plan for economic and physical development designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; and to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewage, schools, parks, and other public services. 
4.03.  The Commission and City Council of the City of Meridian, Mississippi, recognize that there are some uses which, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances thereby having a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas, such that special regulation of these uses is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. The Commission and City Council of the City of Meridian, Mississippi, find that there is substantial evidence, including numerous studies, reports, and findings on the potential harmful effect of adult entertainment uses made by other cities, experts, city planners, etc. which document that such uses adversely affect property values, cause an increase in crime, encourage businesses to move elsewhere, and contribute to neighborhood blight. The Commission and City Council of the City of Meridian, Mississippi find it necessary, expedient and in the best interest of the citizens of Meridian, Mississippi, to regulate the operation and location of adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of stemming a potential increase in the criminal activities and disturbances of the peace and good order of the community, maintaining property values, preventing injuries to residential neighborhoods and commercial districts, and protecting and preserving the quality of life through effective land use planning. 
Sec. 5. - Goals. 
    The goals of the Meridian Comprehensive Plan and the continuous, comprehensive planning process are to provide guidance for rational response to change. They reflect, ideally, consideration of a combination of community issues and facts blended with community values. Goals, objectives, and policies institute the conscious statements of a community concerning what it wants to become and how it will direct its energy toward that achievement and form the basis for zoning regulations. 
Sec. 6. - Omission provision. 
    The omission of any specific use, dimension, word, phrase, or other provision from this ordinance shall not be interpreted as permitting any variation from the general meaning and intent of this ordinance as ordinarily construed or interpreted. If a question arises as to such intent or meaning, the interpretation of the governing authorities shall prevail. The City of Meridian shall not be liable for any errors, inaccuracies, omissions or untimeliness of any information contained herein or provide by any method of conveyance what-so-ever. 
(Ord. No. 4367, § 1, 3-16-2010) 
Sec. 7. - Severability. 
    Should any section or provision of this ordinance declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of this ordinance as a whole, or any part thereof, other than the part so held to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
Sec. 8. - Provisions declared minimum. 
8.01.

Sec. 710. - Buffer yard and screening standards. 
710.01.  Purpose and intent: The purpose and intent of the buffer/screening standards is to create and preserve environmental features and amenities of the city for present and future generations. These regulations are designed to improve the appearance and compatibility of land development through the preservation, installation and maintenance of plantings and fencing for screening and aesthetic effects, thereby serving to protect and preserve the appearance, character, value and safety of the total urban area. Attractive, well-maintained buffer yards improve the quality of development. They can also alleviate development disputes by providing neighboring property owners with tools for mitigating the impact of change. These standards shall apply to all buffer and screening required by other provisions of the zoning regulations. It is intended that these provisions shall constitute minimum requirements. 
710.02.  Purposes of buffer yards and screens: The purpose of a buffer yard is to provide a spatial or distance barrier between two (2) potentially incompatible uses or users. The purpose of screening is to provide an effective visual/auditory barrier between two (2) potentially incompatible uses or users. 
710.03.  Site plan standards: The required site plan shall clearly and convincingly demonstrate compliance with this section by describing all development and protections considered necessary to create a reasonable transition to and protection of the adjacent property. See Section 1300 Site Plan Review for informational and processing requirements.

710.05.  Buffering: Buffering and screening to the standards of this section shall be provided on the site applying for a permit as indicated in 710.04 Buffering/Screening Table. A buffer yard of the minimum width, unbroken except for vehicular and pedestrian access way shall be located parallel to the property line. 
710.06.  Screening: 
(1)  A screen/fence/wall of wood, masonry, stone, concrete or metal shall be placed along the property line or along the inner perimeter of the buffer yard so as to provide visual screening at minimum height requirements prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy as indicated in 710.04 Buffering/Screening Table. 
(2)  A screen (wall, fence, or landscaping) not less than six (6) feet in height shall be erected or maintained between non-residentially zoned property and abutting residentially zoned property at the time that any building or structure is erected on the non-residential property. The height of the screening shall be the vertical distance measured from the top of the screen to the lowest point to grade within three (3) feet of such screen on the non-residentially zoned property. A new screen shall not be required where there is an existing screen which substantially conforms to this section on the abutting residential property. However, if an existing screen on abutting residential property is the only screen that conforms to this section, and if it is removed, a new screen shall then be required on the non-residential property. 
(3)  The screening required herein shall consist of a solid, opaque fence or wall not less than six (6) nor more than eight (8) feet in height, but shall not extend within fifteen (15) feet of any driveway opening onto a street. The screening shall be placed along the property lines or in case of screening along a street, twenty (20) feet from the street pavement with landscaping (trees, shrubs, grass, and other planting) between the screening and the paved area of the street. A louvered fence shall be considered solid if it blocks vision at ninety (90) degrees to the line of the fence or wall. Planting of a type approved by the site plan review committee may also be allowed in lieu of fence or wall. 
710.07.  Installation and maintenance: All buffer yards and screening shall be installed in a sound workman-like manner and according to accepted good planting procedures with the quality of plant material as herein described. All screening elements of buffer yards shall be installed so as to meet all other applicable ordinances and code requirements. No buffer yard shall be abandoned, paved, or otherwise employed for purposes other than screening and buffering. Buffer yards shall require protection from encroachment of vehicular traffic. The owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of all buffer yards which shall be maintained in good condition so as to present a safe, clean and orderly appearance. 
710.08.  Corner visibility: At street intersections and at intersections of driveways with public ROW and/or approved Private Street ROW, corner visibility shall conform to Section 701 of this ordinance. 
710.09.  Reserved. 
710.10.  Credit for existing plant material: If the owner(s) can demonstrate that healthy plant material exists on a site prior to its development for the purposes of buffer yard screening, and that this material shall remain in place and healthy after development, then this material may be used to achieve compliance with this section. 
710.11.  Disposal area screening: All developments shall provide screening to the standards of this section for waste disposal and garbage pick-up areas and facilities. 
710.12.  Maintenance enforcement: All required planting shall be permanently maintained in good growing condition and, whenever necessary, replaced with new plant materials to ensure continued compliance with applicable landscaping requirements. All required fences and walls shall be permanently maintained in good condition and, whenever necessary, repaired or replaced. In the event that the owner fails to maintain a buffer yard or planting strip as required, the city shall have the right to go onto said property, maintain said buffer yard or planting strip and assess the property owner in the same manner as for taxes. Before such work by the city the owner shall be given notice of the offending condition and a reasonable opportunity to repair it and is entitled to a due process hearing concerning the same. 
710.13.  Permits: Whenever a buffer yard is required, it shall be completed prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy and shall thereafter be maintained to provide spatial separation from abutting properties. 
Secs. 711-713. - Reserved. 
Sec. 714. - Off-street parking and loading. 
714.01.  Purpose and intent: The primary planning purpose of these requirements is to reduce traffic congestion on public streets by requiring parking to be off public streets. This provides additional traffic lanes, provides more traffic capacity, allows faster emergency access, and allows narrower streets to be designed within subdivisions. Secondary purposes include: minimizing development problems with neighboring uses; providing for special parking needs for handicapped drivers; providing adequate space for loading (or unloading) and parking for all uses; allowing flexibility in meeting the community parking needs and to maintain many of the environmental features and amenities of the city for present and future generations. Adherence to these regulations will improve the appearance and compatibility of vehicular use areas (parking lots) and other development within the city through the installation and maintenance of trees and plantings for screening and aesthetic effects, thereby serving to protect and preserve community appearance, character, value and safety. 
714.02.  Parking ratios required for all uses: Applicants for building permits must conform to the following requirement for off-street parking for specific uses. The downtown core area of the Central Business District (bounded on the north by 10th Street, on the east by 18th Avenue, on the south by the railroad and on the west by 26th Avenue) is exempt from off-street parking requirements.

(4)  Off-site parking facilities: If required parking cannot be reasonably constructed on the premises of the use in question, the parking may be located off-site. The off-site parking should be located no further than approximately four hundred (400) feet from the off-site parking area to the front public entrance of the building containing the use. This distance is the shortest distance a pedestrian must walk and not cross major streets except at cross-walks. 
(5)  Off-street loading requirements: If required loading cannot be reasonably constructed on the premises of the use in question, the parking may be located off-site. The off-site parking must be located no further than approximately three hundred (300) feet reasonably walkable by a pedestrian from the front door in the building containing the retail use. Such off-site lots must be closed to public access during hours the business is closed. Approval for off-site lots shall be given by building official. 
714.03.  Parking Reductions: 
(1)  Reductions or variance of up to fifty (50) percent of that otherwise required may be granted by the Zoning Administrator as follows: 
(a.)  Upon demonstration to the Zoning Administrator that effective alternatives to automobile access are in effect reductions may be allowed to an extent commensurate with the permanence, effectiveness, and demonstrated reduction in off-street parking demand effectuated by such alternatives; 
(b.)  When it can be proven that the facility (or facilities) to be served is unique and would not in its day-to-day operation normally require a full complement of parking provided that an adequate reserved land area is provided to accommodate a full complement of parking when necessary to serve occasional peek demand; 
(c.)  When the size and nature of a development is so intense and diverse that the normal parking demand would not be generated; 
(d.)  Where unusual characteristics for the use as proposed by the applicant result in less parking demand than established for the use in this ordinance; 
(e.)  Where the applicant shows that the parking ratio required by the zoning ordinance is incorrect and excessive in all cases for that use as indicated by recent studies and data. 
(2)  Applications for reductions must be made in writing to the Zoning Administrator pursuant to Section 1700 Variances. Applicant must show non-economic hardship or demonstrate with expert evidence that his proposed development does not need the number of parking spaces required in this ordinance. Appeals from the decision of the Zoning Administrator must be made to the Commission within ten (10) working days of the date of the decision pursuant to Section 1400.14. 
714.04.  Enforcement: 
(1)  Prohibitions imposed by this section make it unlawful to: carry out any construction without an approved parking site plan . This includes remodeling buildings, or changing the use on a site without an approved parking site plan . 
(2)  Conformance to the parking site plan is required at all times, after the permits are granted and construction completed. 
(3)  Sites containing more than one (1) use must provide parking spaces equal in sum to all the uses of the site. 
(4)  Existing uses and buildings approved prior to the enactment of the current parking regulations need not meet the current regulations. If the use is enlarged, then the number of parking spaces required by the current regulations must be provided for the enlarged portion only. However, parking design standards may be required for the entire parking facility. 
(5)  For successive enlargements of a building, parking under current ratios must be provided for the sum of all enlargements. If this sum exceeds fifty (50) percent of the floor area of the original building, the applicant must provide the number of parking stalls required by current ratios for the entire building. 
714.05.  Parking design standards: 
(1)  Parking spaces and stalls. 
(a.)  Compliance with ADA standards for parking facilities is required pursuant to the adopted building code. 
(b.)  Except for handicapped spaces, a required parking space shall not be less than eight (8) feet by sixteen (16) feet, excluding all aisles, driveways, entrances and exits. 
(c.)  Each space must be clearly and permanently delineated. 
(d.)  To help prevent traffic congestion problems, parking which allows vehicles to back into streets is prohibited, as is curbside parking on streets.

Sec. 1400. - Special use permit. 
1400.01.  Purposes of special uses, standards and special use permits: 
(1)  The development and implementation of this zoning ordinance is based upon the division of the community into districts, within which the use of land and buildings, and the bulk and location and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics or nature, require special and intensive review to determine whether they should be permitted in specified locations. 
(2)  These special uses also require review based upon standards and the application of special conditions and safeguards if permission is granted in such locations. Special use procedures and standards as provided herein are intended to assure that such review is made and that appropriate conditions and safeguards are attached. Special use procedures and standards shall be applied, and special permits granted, only in cases authorized under this ordinance. 
(3)  Special use permits are required for specified uses which must satisfy standards in addition to those generally applicable in a zoning district to eliminate or minimize the potentially harmful characteristics or impact of such special uses on the character of the zoning district in which they will be located. 
(4)  In addition to zoning procedures and requirements relating generally to issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy/zoning compliance, a special use permit system is hereby established. It is intended that this system shall assure special examination, review, and findings by appropriate agents, agencies or bodies in connection with proposed actions particularly specified in this ordinance. 
(5)  Special use permit procedures and standards as set forth herein are intended to apply in relation to use, occupancy, location, construction, design, character, scale, manner of operation, or necessity for making complex or unusual determinations, and to assure consideration of the particular circumstances of each case and the establishment of such conditions and safeguards as are reasonably necessary for protection of the public interest generally, and of adjacent properties, the neighborhood, and the jurisdiction as a whole. 
(6)  For the purposes of this ordinance, the term requirements refers to the restrictions which apply to all uses in a district, whether permitted as of right or only through a special use permit. They apply automatically to all uses in a zone. Standards are the guidelines for use by administrators in making decisions such as for rezonings, or variances. They involve the application of stated criteria to given situations. Conditions are additional restrictions beyond the stated standards, applied to a particular use, which might govern, for example, hours of operation or the location of exits and entrances or the type of screening. The violation of the conditions is a violation of the ordinance. The above distinctions help to define the way discretion is to be exercised in making the provisions of this ordinance flexible to meet the needs of different situations in particular locations. 
1400.02.  Application for special use permits: Applications for special use permits shall be filed on forms and with supporting material as required by this ordinance. The following supporting materials are required for applications:

1500.01.  Purpose and intent: The purpose of this section is to set forth the application procedures and decision-making standards for amendments to the official zoning map and to the text of the zoning ordinance. The regulations, conditions, specifications and procedures set forth in this ordinance may from time to time require amendment. The City Council, upon receiving the recommendation of the Commission, may amend the provisions of this ordinance after proper public notice and hearing as required by law. No such change shall become effective until after a public hearing has been held in relation thereto by the Commission at which parties in interest and citizens must have an opportunity to be heard. When an application has been made to the Commission for the change in regulations or district boundaries, the applicant must, prior to the holding of a public hearing on such applications, fully comply with the procedures set forth below. 
1500.02.  Application and process: 
(1)  Person must make application for amendment: Any person requesting a zoning map or text change must submit a completed application to and in a form provided by the Zoning Administrator. This application form must include (in the case of a map change) a location map, a survey map showing existing and proposed zoning district boundary lines and classification/s, a correct legal description, the exact nature of the proposed change, and documentation justifying the reasons the application is made. Applications for text amendments must include exact nature of proposed change and adequate justification for same. All informational requirements of the application must be met and the application signed by applicant and owner(s) of property. Incomplete applications will not be submitted to the Commission. 
(2)  An application fee is required: See Section 1800 and latest fee schedule. Changes initiated by the City are exempt from the fee requirement. 
(3)  Public notice must be given: Once the above requirements have been met, one (1) or more signs shall be posted on the subject property at least two weeks prior to give the people living or working in the area due notice of a public hearing before the Commission to be held at a date and time set by the Zoning Administrator. A rezoning public hearing notice must be published in a local newspaper at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing. 
(4)  Commission holds public hearing and makes a decision: The Commission must make its recommendation in writing on all matters presented to it within a period of thirty (30) days from the conclusion of the hearing. The Zoning Administrator must then mail a copy of this recommendation to all parties appearing at the hearing within three (3) working days of such decision unless the recommendation is in the affirmative and no one other than the applicant appears at the public hearing. 
(5)  Commission forwards recommendation to the City Council: After such public hearing the Commission shall make its recommendation to the City Council. The City Council may accept the Commission's recommendation, or reject it in whole or in part, or may send it back to the Commission for further consideration and/or hearing. 
(6)  City Council may approve the amendment: Upon City Council approval and signing by the Mayor, the zoning change goes into effect as allowed by law. 
(7)  Time limit: If no significant development activity such as construction of building foundations, paving, or utility installation occurs on the property effected by a zoning change within one (1) year from the effective date of the change, the property reverts to its previous zoning classification. 
(8)  As a condition to granting the relief sought by the applicant the City may, in its discretion, require that the applicant impress and impose upon the subject property restrictive and protective covenants, approved as to form and content by all objecting property owners whose property adjoins the subject property or property separated from the subject property by a thoroughfare. 
(9)  The City may utilize conditional zoning in granting the relief sought by the rezoning applicant. Conditional zoning is the method whereby property can be rezoned to a particular zoning district with conditions or limitations on the uses permitted. 
1500.03.  Amendment to official map: In acting on applications for amendments to the official zoning map, all parties shall consider the proposed change in relation to the following standards: 
(1)  Rezonings must pass threshold standards: No proposed zoning amendment will receive favorable recommendation unless it passes the following threshold standards: 
(A)  The proposal must provide conclusive evidence of a mistake in the original zoning either due to a clerical error, or due to over-zoning for a district classification; 
(B)  The proposal must provide clear and convincing evidence of a public need for the rezoning at the proposed location; 
(C)  The proposed change must not be a small parcel of land singled out for special and privileged treatment, nor create an isolated district, unrelated and incompatible to adjacent districts; 
(D)  The proposed change must be found to be in the public interest and not only for the benefit of the land owner(s); 
(E)  The proposed change must be found to be consistent with all elements of the comprehensive plan and based on sound planning principles as follows: 
1.  If a development proposal falls within one of the use and/or residential density categories indicated on the Future Land Use map, then the proposal is consistent with the plan; OR 
2.  If a development proposal is not consistent with said map, then the plan's written policies shall be used to determine whether the proposal would undermine or conflict with the plan. If it is found that the proposal would not conflict with or undermine the plan's policies, then the proposal is consistent with the plan; OR 
3.  If a development proposal falls adjacent to a district having the desired zoning classification, the rezoning proposal may be found to be consistent as an extension of the adjacent property's zoning classification. 
(2)  Additional Standards: If the rezoning application does not pass the above threshold standards, the proposed amendment will be considered to be spot zoning and will be denied on that basis. If the application passes the above thresholds, then the following review standards shall also be considered: 
(a.)  Whether the existing land use pattern will change such that it could possibly increase the load on public facilities such as schools, utilities, or streets; 
(b.)  Whether existing zoning district boundaries are illogically drawn in relation to existing conditions on the property proposed for change; 
(c.)  Whether changed or changing conditions made the passage of the proposed rezoning necessary; 
(d.)  Whether the proposed change will adversely influence living conditions and/or property values in the neighborhood; 
(e.)  Whether the proposed change will excessively increase traffic congestion or otherwise negatively affect public safety; 
(f.)  Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with its existing zoning; 
(g.)  Whether the proposed change is speculative or has a valid and specific intent and purpose; 
(h.)  Whether there is convincing demonstration that all uses allowed under the proposed district classification would be appropriate in the neighborhood and that the character of the neighborhood will not be materially and adversely effected by the proposed change. 
1500.04.  Amendment to ordinance text: Proposed amendments to zoning ordinance text shall be evaluated for compliance with all elements of the comprehensive plan and other applicable considerations of Section 1500. 
1500.05.  Reapplication when denied: If an application for an amendment to the zoning ordinance is recommended for denial by the Commission and either not appealed to, or is denied by the City Council, then a reapplication pertaining to the same property and/or requesting the same amendment may not be filed within 18 months of the date final action was taken on the initial application except as otherwise authorized by the City Council. 
1500.06.  Comprehensive rezonings: 
(1)  The purpose of a comprehensive rezoning is to rezone areas in conformance with the principles of comprehensive land use planning and staged development as reflected by established public plans and policies, and planned public facilities. Consideration will be given to the character of the areas, suitability of particular uses, protecting natural areas, conserving the value of buildings and communities and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the city. These procedures shall further the protection of the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(2)  Comprehensive rezonings shall be limited to those areas designated as planning districts for which a policy has been approved or adopted by the City Council after a public hearing. 
(3)  The Zoning Administrator shall process the application in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1500.02 
1500.07.  Appeals from Commission: Any person desiring to appeal any decision to the City Council shall give notice thereof to the Zoning Administrator within a period of ten (10) working days from the date of the Commission's decision. The Zoning Administrator shall forward this notice to the City Council. When an appeal is perfected in this manner, the City Council shall then hold a public hearing with due notice thereof as provided by law. 
1500.08.  City Council public hearing: After a notice of an appeal has been received, the City Council will set a public hearing time, date, and place with a fifteen-day (15) public notice. At the public hearing the City Council will hear the appellant(s) first and then other interested parties. In making its decision, the City Council must base its reasons for approval or denial upon the standards in Section 1500.03. In case of a protest against such change signed by the owners of twenty (20) percent or more (measured by number of parcels) either inside the area proposed for rezoning, or those parcels immediately adjacent to the rear thereof and extending one hundred sixty (160) feet therefrom or of those directly opposite thereto and extending one hundred sixty (160) feet from the street frontage of such opposite lots, such amendment shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of all the members of the City Council. Decisions of the City Council shall be deemed final unless appeal to the courts as prescribed by law.

(2)  In order to authorize any variance from the terms of the ordinance, the Zoning Administrator must find: 
(a.)  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district; 
(b.)  That literal interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this ordinance and would work an unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant;

(f.)  That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the ordinance and that such variance will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise detrimental to the public interest; 
(g.)  That the reduced setback will not substantially reduce the amount of privacy that would be enjoyed by nearby residences;

A distance of at least ten (10) feet between buildings must be maintained at all times for fire protection. 
(6)  A response will be provided within thirty (30) days. 
(7)  The Zoning Administrator must make findings that the requirements of sections 1700.01 and 1700.02 have been met by the applicant for a variance. 
(8)  The Zoning Administrator must further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance. 
1700.03.  Application procedures:

(c.)  An elevation drawing, if determined necessary by the Zoning Administrator, showing existing and proposed building or structure; 
(d.)  Notarized signature(s) of the affected adjoining property owner(s) of record not objecting to the proposed variance;
