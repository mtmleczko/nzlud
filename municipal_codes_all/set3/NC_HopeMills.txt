PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Hope Mills, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1999 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Board of Commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1999 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel Walker, Code Attorney, and Jean B. Lindsay, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Melissa Adams, Town Manager, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts, those of other town officials, and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

The board of commissioners recognizes the increasing evidence that smoke creates a danger to the health of some citizens and is a cause of annoyance and physical discomfort to those who are near smoke. The purpose and intent of this article is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by prohibiting smoking within all town property.

Sec. 42-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The floodprone areas within the jurisdiction of the town are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in floodprone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards. 
(Code 1999, § 42-57; Ord. of 12-18-2006, § 1(art. I(B)) 
Sec. 42-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within floodprone areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Code 1999, § 42-58; Ord. of 12-18-2006, § 1(art. I(C)) 
Sec. 42-4. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this chapter are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (e.g., water and gas mains, electrical, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in floodprone areas; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas; and 
(7)  To ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area. 
(Code 1999, § 42-59; Ord. of 12-18-2006, § 1(art. I(D)) 
Sec. 42-5. - Definitions.

    Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within the special flood hazard areas established in section 42-7. The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in sections 42-63 and 42-64, shall apply to all development within such areas: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated that: 
a.  The proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices and presented to the floodplain administrator prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit; or 
b.  A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion of the proposed encroachment. 
(2)  If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
(3)  No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the following provisions are met:

(1)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling, the ordinance of the town may fix a certain percentage of this value as being reasonable, requiring the owner, within the time specified, to repair, alter or improve the dwelling in order to render it fit for human habitation. The order may require that the property be vacated and closed only if continued occupancy during the time allowed for repair will present a significant threat of bodily harm, taking into account the nature of the necessary repairs, alterations, or improvements; the current state of the property; and any additional risks due to the presence and capacity of minors under the age of 18 years or occupants with physical or mental disabilities. The order shall state that the failure to make timely repairs as directed in the order shall make the dwelling subject to the issuance of an unfit order; or 
(2)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling (the ordinance of the town may fix a certain percentage of this value as being reasonable), requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to remove or demolish such dwelling. However, notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the dwelling is located in an historic district and the historic district commission determines, after a public hearing as provided by this article, that the dwelling is of particular significance or value toward maintaining the character of the district, and the dwelling has not been condemned as unsafe, the order may require that the dwelling be vacated and closed consistent with G.S. 160A-400.14(a). 
(Code 1999, § 50-78(b)) 
Sec. 50-73. - Failure to comply with order regarding dwelling. 
(a)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter or improve or to vacate and close the dwelling, the public officer may cause the dwelling to be repaired, altered or improved or to be vacated and closed. The public officer may cause to be posted on the main entrance of any dwelling so closed, a placard with the following words: 
"This building is unfit for human habitation; the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited and unlawful." 
(b)  Occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor. The duties of the public officer set forth in this section shall not be exercised until the board of commissioners shall have, by ordinance, ordered the public officer to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this article with respect to the particular property which the public officer shall have found to be unfit for human habitation and which property shall be described in the ordinance. This article shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds in the county wherein the property is located and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. 
(c)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the dwelling, the public officer may cause such dwelling to be removed or demolished. The duties of the public officer set forth in this subdivision shall not be exercised until the board of commissioners shall have, by ordinance, ordered the public officer to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this article with respect to the particular property which the public officer shall have found to be unfit for human habitation and which property shall be described in the ordinance. No such ordinance shall be adopted to require demolition of a dwelling until the owner has first been given a reasonable opportunity to bring it into conformity with the housing code. This article shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds in the county wherein the property is located and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. 
(d)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the dwelling, the public officer may cause such dwelling to be removed or demolished.

This article shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds in the county wherein the property is located and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. 
(e)  If the board of commissioners shall have adopted an ordinance ordering the public officer to effectuate the purpose of this article regarding a specific property which the officer found unfit for human habitation, or the public officer shall have issued an order, ordering a dwelling to be repaired or vacated and closed, and if the dwelling has been vacated and closed for a period of one year pursuant to the ordinance or order, then if the board of commissioners shall find that the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter or improve the dwelling in order to render it fit for human habitation and that the continuation of the dwelling in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the municipality in that the dwelling would continue to deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities, would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in the area, and would render unavailable property and a dwelling which might otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent and affordable housing in this state, then in such circumstances, the board of commissioners may, after the expiration of such one-year period, enact an ordinance and serve such ordinance on the owner, setting forth the following: 
(1)  If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it fit for human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding 50 percent of the then-current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner either repair or demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days; or 
(2)  If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceeding 50 percent of the then-current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days. 
(f)  This article shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds in the county wherein the property is located and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index.

The lien shall be filed, having priority, and be collected in the same manner as the lien for special assessments established by G.S. 160A-10. 
(b)  The amount of the cost is also a lien on any other real property of the owner located within the town limits or within one mile thereof except for the owner's primary residence. The additional lien provided in this subsection is inferior to all prior liens and shall be collected as a money judgment. 
(c)  If the dwelling is removed or demolished by the public officer, he shall sell the materials of the dwelling, and any personal property, fixtures or appurtenances found in or attached to the dwelling, and shall credit the proceeds of the sale against the cost of the removal or demolition, and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court by the public officer, shall be secured in a manner directed by the court, and shall be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of the court.

Sec. 50-79. - Failure to comply with order to vacate; civil action by town. 
    If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling, the public officer may file a civil action in the name of the town to remove such occupant. The action to vacate the dwelling shall be in the nature of summary ejectment and shall be commenced by filing a complaint naming as parties-defendant any persons occupying such dwelling. The clerk of the superior court shall issue a summons requiring the defendant to appear before a magistrate at a certain time, date and place not to exceed ten days from the issuance of the summons to answer the complaint. The summons and complaint shall be served as provided in G.S. 42-29. The summons shall be returned according to its tenor, and if on its return it appears to have been duly served, and if at the hearing the public officer produces a certified copy of an ordinance adopted by the board of commissioners authorizing the officer to proceed to vacate the occupied dwelling, the magistrate shall enter judgment ordering that the premises be vacated and that all persons be removed. The judgment ordering that the dwelling be vacated shall be enforced in the same manner as the judgment for summary ejectment entered under G.S. 42-30. An appeal from any judgment entered hereunder by the magistrate may be taken as provided in G.S. 7A-228, and the execution of such judgment may be stayed as provided in G.S. 7A-227. An action to remove an occupant of a dwelling who is a tenant of the owner may not be in the nature of a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant to this section unless such occupant was served with notice at least 30 days before the filing of the summary ejectment proceeding that the board of commissioners has ordered the public officer to proceed to exercise his duties to vacate and close or remove and demolish the dwelling. 
Sec. 50-80. - Notice of order to certain affordable housing organizations. 
    Whenever a determination is made that a dwelling must be vacated and closed, or removed or demolished, under the provisions of this article, notice of the order shall be given by first class mail to any organization involved in providing or restoring dwellings for affordable housing that has filed a written request for such notices. A minimum period of 45 days from the mailing of such notice shall be given before removal or demolition by action of the public officer, to allow the opportunity for any organization to negotiate with the owner to make repairs, lease, or purchase the property for the purpose of providing affordable housing. The public officer or clerk shall certify the mailing of the notices, and the certification shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. Only an organization that has filed a written request for such notices may raise the issue of failure to mail such notices, and the sole remedy shall be an order requiring the public officer to wait 45 days before causing removal or demolition.

Sec. 58-163. - Enforcement. 
    A curfew applicable to minors is established and shall be enforced as follows: 
(1)  Time limits. It is unlawful for any minor under the age of 18 years to be or remain upon any public place in the town between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. on Saturday, or between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, or between the hours of 12:01 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.

This requirement is intended to hold a neglectful or careless parent up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall, therefore, be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor. 
(5)  Responsibility of business establishments. It is unlawful for any person operating a place of business or amusement to allow or permit any minor to be in upon, or to remain in or upon, any place of business or amusement operated by them within the applicable curfew hours set by subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this section, except as otherwise provided in section 58-164. The owner, operator or any employee of an establishment commits an offense if he knowingly allows a minor to remain upon the premises of the establishment during the restricted hours. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that an owner, operator or employer should reasonably be expected to have concerning the patrons of an establishment. The standard for the term "knowingly" shall be applied through an objective test: whether a reasonable person in the operator's or employee's position should have known that the patron was a minor in violation of this section. 
(6)  Aiding and abetting by adult, guardian or parent. It is unlawful for an adult, guardian or parent to allow, permit, encourage, aid or abet a minor in the violation of subsections (1), (2) or (3) of this section, except as otherwise provided in section 58-164.

(Code 1999, § 62-8; Ord. of 7-17-2006(1), § 1) 
Sec. 62-9. - Code of conduct. 
(a)  Intent. The town parks and recreation department activities are made available to youth and adults to enjoy fun and wholesome recreational programming that teaches character and sportsmanship. The town parks and recreation department supports the belief that all recreational programming and experiences should be positive and safe with sportsmanship and enjoyment the primary goal. To achieve this goal, the town parks and recreation department strives to provide a safe environment for participants of these programs and to protect them from harm to the best of our abilities. To that end, all participants and spectators must be held accountable for their behavior and zero tolerance given for intentional violation of this code of conduct. It is hoped that situations never warrant the removal of an individual from any activity, event or facility. However, it is the obligation of the town parks and recreation department to maintain a controlled, safe and healthy environment for everyone. Recreation activities are designed to foster qualities such as character building, social interaction, enjoyment and relaxation while educating the general public and promoting healthy lifestyles. Such activities are not designed to be overly competitive and the town parks and recreation department does not promote this contention. 
(b)  Expectations. All persons and groups using the town parks and recreation department facilities, and participating in activities thereon/therein, should treat all persons with dignity and respect, use appropriate language, tone and volume when communicating, and when in doubt, should remain silent. Such persons and groups should also become knowledgeable, understanding and supportive of all established guidelines, rules, policies and procedures applicable to related programs and activities, and recognize and acknowledge that the use and participation in the town parks and recreation department facilities and programming is a privilege that can be rescinded for the greater good. Negative attitudes, verbal abuse of officials, poor sportsmanship, profanity, child predators and violence cast a negative light in our arena. It is for that reason that penalties have been assessed and will be enforced for acts perceived by the town parks and recreation department as intentional violations. 
(c)  Prohibited conduct. It shall be a violation of this code of conduct for any person or groups of persons utilizing the town parks and recreation department facilities, or participating in any activities or programs involving the use of such facilities, to engage in any of the following conduct: 
(1)  Failure to follow the established guidelines, rules, policies and procedures of the department applicable to such activities, facilities or programs; 
(2)  Failure to comply with a department official's decision; 
(3)  Taunting, mocking, and/or harassment of players; 
(4)  Engaging in rude gestures or comments, screaming or loudly disagreeing with others, obscene, vulgar or profane language, throwing, kicking or striking of bats and other miscellaneous equipment, unnecessary roughness among participants; 
(5)  Use of malicious obscene, profane, vulgar language or verbal abuse directed towards another individual, verbal epithets to race, color, religion, creed, gender or sexual orientation of another person; 
(6)  Communication of threats, physical violence or the act of insulting another with intent to offend, defame or embarrass another person; 
(7)  Physical aggression toward another person, pushing, shoving, striking or inappropriately touching another person with the intent to incite, inflict or cause physical harm, invading another individual's personal space during a dispute; 
(8)  Any violation of state law, possession of firearms, knives, explosive devices and weapons; 
(9)  Being under the influence of any impairing substance, alcohol, narcotics, controlled substances, or chemicals or having possession of drug paraphernalia or assaulting another in any manner. 
(d)  Suspension from use of facilities. If in the opinion of the town parks and recreation official at the facility, program or activity involved any person or groups of persons is engaging in any of the prohibited activities, as set out hereinabove, such official shall have the authority to suspend such persons or groups from using the town parks and recreation department facilities, or from participating in any of the programs or activities therein. In addition, such official shall have the authority to immediately suspend such persons or groups, as hereinafter set forth. Such official will offer to escort the offending individual from the facility. If the offending individual refuse to leave the premises, local law enforcement authorities will be contacted and requested to enforce the ruling. For a violation of the conduct as set out in subsections (c)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section the suspension shall be for a minimum period of ten days. For a violation of the conduct as set out in subsections (c)(5) and (6) of this section, the suspension shall be for a minimum period of 30 days. For a violation of the conduct as set out in subsections (c)(7), (8) or (9) of this section, the suspension shall be for a minimum period of 180 days. 
Within 48 hours following any such suspension the town parks and recreation department shall provide written notice, by certified mail, to the suspended person or group setting out the details of the violation and suspension in effect. Such notice shall also state that the suspension may be appealed in writing to the director of the town parks and recreation department, by written response to be delivered to the director within 48 hours of receipt of such letter. If appealed, the director shall refer the matter to a panel/committee consisting of the facility supervisor, program supervisor, athletic supervisor and the department director, and an investigation shall be undertaken by such panel. During the investigation, the individual will be suspended from the facilities and activities of the town parks and recreation department. Such individual requesting the appeal will then be requested to appear before the appeal review committee for hearing. The decision of the panel will be rendered within ten working days from the receipt of the appeal. The decision of the committee shall be final. Suspensions of less than ten days are not subject to appeal. However, upon reviewing the ejection and supervisor reports, the parks and recreation director, athletic supervisor or the town manager may reduce the suspension or, if appropriate hereunder, increase the period of the suspension. The standard to be used by the committee in making its decision shall be whether or not the continued use of the facilities or participation in the activities or program by the suspended person or group will be detrimental to the health, welfare, safety and recreation of the general public.

ARTICLE III. - PHASE II STORMWATER POST-CONSTRUCTION 

Sec. 82-87. - Title. 
    This article shall be officially known as "The Phase II Stormwater Post-Construction Article of the Stormwater Management Ordinance." It is referred to herein as "this article." 
(Code 1999, § 67-70; Ord. of 1-22-2008, § 1) 
Sec. 82-88. - Authority. 
    The town board of commissioners is authorized to adopt the ordinance from which this article is derived pursuant to state law, including, but not limited to, article 14, section 5 of the Constitution of North Carolina; G.S. 143-214.7 and rules promulgated by the environmental management commission thereunder, Session Law 2004-163; chapter 160A, §§ 174, 185. 
(Code 1999, § 67-71; Ord. of 1-22-2008, § 1) 
Sec. 82-89. - Findings. 
(a)  It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge; 
(2)  These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment; and 
(3)  These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites. 
(b)  Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 ("Clean Water Act") and Federal Phase II stormwater rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the state environmental management commission promulgated in response to Federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas, including the town, to adopt minimum stormwater management controls such as those included in this article. 
(c)  Therefore, the board of commissioners establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge. 
(Code 1999, § 67-72; Ord. of 1-22-2008, § 1) 
Sec. 82-90. - Purpose. 
(a)  General. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of construction-related and post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure; safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare; and protect water and aquatic resources. 
(b)  Specific. This article seeks to meet its general purpose through the following specific objectives and means: 
(1)  Establishing decision-making processes for development that protect the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establishing design and review criteria for the construction, function, and use of structural stormwater BMPs that may be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices, such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of green space, riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable; 
(6)  Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no threat to public safety; 
(7)  Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, for the inspection of approved projects, and to ensure appropriate long-term maintenance.

    Larger common plan of development or sale means any area where multiple separate and distinct construction or land-disturbing activities will occur under one plan. A plan is any announcement or piece of documentation (including, but not limited to, a sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch, advertisement, loan application, drawing, permit application, zoning request, or computer design) or physical demarcation (including, but not limited to, boundary signs, lot stakes, or surveyor markings) indicating that construction activities may occur on a specific plot. 
    One-year, 24-hour storm means the surface runoff resulting from a 24-hour rainfall of an intensity expected to be equaled or exceeded, on average, once in 12 months and with a duration of 24 hours. 
    Owner means the legal or beneficial owner of land, including, but not limited to, a mortgagee or vendee in possession, receiver, executor, trustee, or long-term or commercial lessee, or any other person or entity holding proprietary rights in the property or having legal power of management and control of the property. The term "owner" includes long-term commercial tenants; management entities, such as those charged with or engaged in the management of properties for profit; and every person or entity having joint ownership of the property. A secured lender not in possession of the property does not constitute an owner, unless the secured lender is included within the meaning of the term "owner" under another description in this definition, such as a management entity. 
    Redevelopment means any rebuilding activity other than a rebuilding activity that results in no net increase in built-upon area and provides equal or greater stormwater control than the previous development. 
    Seasonal high-water table means the upper surface of groundwater. This level may fluctuate throughout the year depending on soil, landscape, and weather conditions. 
    Structural BMP means a physical device designed to trap, settle out, or filter pollutants from stormwater runoff; to alter or reduce stormwater runoff velocity, amount, timing, or other characteristics; to approximate the predevelopment hydrology on a developed site; or to achieve any combination of these goals. The term "structural BMP" includes physical practices such as constructed wetlands, vegetative practices, filter strips, grassed swales, and other methods installed or created on real property. The term "structural BMP" is synonymous with the terms "structural practice," "stormwater control facility," "stormwater control practice," "stormwater treatment practice," "stormwater management practice," "stormwater control measures," "structural stormwater treatment systems," and similar terms used in this article. 
    Substantial progress means, for the purposes of determining whether sufficient progress has been made on an approved plan, one or more of the following construction activities toward the completion of a site or subdivision plan shall occur: Conducting grading activity on a continuous basis and not discontinued for more than 30 days; or installation and approval of on-site infrastructure; or obtaining a building permit for the construction and approval of a building foundation. The term "substantial progress," for purposes of determining whether an approved plan is null and void, is not necessarily the same as "substantial expenditures" used for determining vested rights pursuant to applicable law. 
    Total suspended solids means a measure of the suspended solids in wastewater, effluent or water bodies.

Escrowed funds may be spent by the association for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, and reconstruction of the structural BMPs, provided that town shall first consent to the expenditure. 
(3)  Both developer contribution and annual sinking funds shall fund the escrow account. Prior to the release of the installation performance security as outlined in section 82-115, the developer shall pay into the escrow account an amount equal to 15 percent of the initial construction cost of the structural BMPs. Two-thirds of the total amount of sinking fund budget shall be deposited into the escrow account within the first five years and the full amount shall be deposited within ten years following initial construction of the structural BMPs. Funds shall be deposited each year into the escrow account. A portion of the annual assessments of the association shall include an allocation into the escrow account. Any funds drawn down from the escrow account shall be replaced in accordance with the schedule of anticipated work used to create the sinking fund budget. 
(4)  The percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to fund the escrow account may be varied by the town depending on the design and materials of the stormwater control and management facility. 
(5)  Granting to the town a right of entry to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, and reconstruct structural BMPs. 
(6)  Allowing the town to recover from the association and its members any and all costs the town expends to maintain or repair the structural BMPs or to correct any operational deficiencies. Failure to pay the town all of its expended costs, after 30 days' written notice, shall constitute a breach of the agreement. In case of a deficiency, the town shall thereafter be entitled to bring an action against the association and its members to pay, or foreclose upon the lien hereby authorized by the agreement against the property, or both. Interest, collection costs, and attorney's fees shall be added to the recovery. 
(7)  A statement that this agreement shall not obligate the town to maintain or repair any structural BMPs, and the town shall not be liable to any person for the condition or operation of structural BMPs. 
(8)  A statement that this agreement shall not in any way diminish, limit, or restrict the right of the town to enforce any of its ordinances as authorized by law. 
(9)  A provision indemnifying and holding harmless the town for any costs and injuries arising from or related to the structural BMP, unless the town has agreed in writing to assume the maintenance responsibility for the BMP and has accepted dedication of any and all rights necessary to carry out that maintenance.

(1)  Installed by the permit holder as required by the approved stormwater management plan; and/or 
(2)  Maintained by the owner as required by the operation and maintenance agreement. 
(b)  Amount. 
(1)  Installation. The amount of an installation performance security shall be the total estimated construction cost of the BMPs approved under the permit, plus 25 percent. The installation performance security shall remain in place until at least 60 days after final approval. In cases where the facility initially functions as an erosion control measure, the installation performance security shall remain in place until at least 60 days after the facility starts of function as a stormwater management facility. 
(2)  Maintenance. The amount of a maintenance performance security shall be the present value of an annuity of perpetual duration based on a reasonable estimate of the annual cost of inspection as determined by the stormwater administrator for operation and maintenance of the BMPs approved under the permit, at a discount rate that reflects the jurisdiction's cost of borrowing minus a reasonable estimate of long-term inflation. 
(c)  Uses of performance security. 
(1)  Forfeiture provisions. The performance security shall contain forfeiture provisions, after proper notice, for failure to complete work within the time specified, or to initiate or maintain any actions which may be required of the applicant or owner in accordance with this article, approvals issued pursuant to this article, or an operation and maintenance agreement established pursuant to this article. 
(2)  Default. Upon default of the owner to construct, maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct any structural BMP in accordance with the applicable permit or operation and maintenance agreement, the stormwater administrator shall obtain and use all or any portion of the security to make necessary improvements based on an engineering estimate. Such expenditure of funds shall only be made after requesting the owner to comply with the permit or maintenance agreement. In the event of a default triggering the use of installation performance security, the town shall not return any of the unused deposited cash funds or other security, which shall be retained for maintenance. 
(3)  Costs in excess of performance security. If the town takes action upon such failure by the applicant or owner, the town may collect from the applicant or owner the difference between the amount of the reasonable cost of such action and the amount of the security held, in addition to any other penalties or damages due. 
(4)  Refund. No sooner than 60 days after final approval, the applicant may petition the town to release the value of the performance security. For single-family residential subdivisions, the 60-day timeframe shall be as outlined in section 82-108. The petition must include certification from a qualified registered state professional engineer or landscape architect certifying that the stormwater management controls are performing as designed and intended. If the stormwater administrator approves the report and accepts the petition, the town may release the installation performance security upon execution by the applicant of an indemnification agreement in favor of the town which shall be a covenant upon the property and run with the land. If the stormwater administrator rejects the petition, the applicant shall be provided with instruction to correct any deficiencies and all steps necessary for the release of the installation performance security.

(b)  Notice of violation and order to correct. When the stormwater administrator finds that any building, structure, or land is in violation of this article, the stormwater administrator shall notify, in writing, the property owner or other person violating this article. The notification shall indicate the nature of the violation, contain the address or other description of the site upon which the violation is occurring, order the necessary action to abate the violation, and give a deadline for correcting the violation. If civil penalties are to be assessed, the notice of violation shall also contain a statement of the civil penalties to be assessed, the time of their accrual, and the time within which they must be paid or be subject to collection as a debt. The stormwater administrator may deliver the notice of violation and correction order personally, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by any means authorized for the service of documents by rule 4 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. If a violation is not corrected within the period of time provided in the notification, the stormwater administrator may take appropriate action under this article to correct and abate the violation and to ensure compliance with this article.

A person who receives a notice of violation and correction order, or the owner of the land on which the violation occurs, may submit to the stormwater administrator a written request for an extension of time for correction of the violation. On determining that the request includes enough information to show that the violation cannot be corrected within the specified time limit for reasons beyond the control of the person requesting the extension, the stormwater administrator may extend the time limit as is reasonably necessary to allow timely correction of the violation, up to, but not exceeding 60 days. The stormwater administrator may grant 30-day extensions in addition to the foregoing extension if the violation cannot be corrected within the permitted time due to circumstances beyond the control of the person violating this article. The stormwater administrator may grant an extension only by written notice of extension. The notice of extension shall state the date prior to which correction must be made, after which the violator will be subject to the penalties described in the notice of violation and correction order. 
(d)  Enforcement after time to correct. After the time has expired to correct a violation, including any extension if authorized by the stormwater administrator, the stormwater administrator shall determine if the violation is corrected. If the violation is not corrected, the stormwater administrator may act to impose one or more of the remedies and penalties authorized by this article. 
(e)  Emergency enforcement. If delay in correcting a violation would seriously threaten the effective enforcement of this article or pose an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, then the stormwater administrator may order the immediate cessation of a violation. Any person so ordered shall cease any violation immediately. The stormwater administrator may seek immediate enforcement, without prior written notice, through any remedy or penalty authorized by this article. 
(Code 1999, § 67-101; Ord. of 1-22-2008, § 1) 
Sec. 82-117. - Remedies and penalties. 
    The remedies and penalties provided for violations of this article, whether civil or criminal, shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy provided by law, and may be exercised in any order. 
(1)  Remedies. 
a.  Withholding of certificate of occupancy. The stormwater administrator or other authorized agent may refuse to issue a certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or being constructed on the site and served by the stormwater practices in question until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein. 
b.  Disapproval of subsequent permits and development approvals. As long as a violation of this article continues and remains uncorrected, the stormwater administrator or other authorized agent may withhold, and the town board of commissioners may disapprove, any request for permit or development approval or authorization provided for by this article or the zoning, subdivision, and/or building regulations, as appropriate for the land on which the violation occurs. 
c.  Injunction, abatements, etc. The stormwater administrator, with the written authorization of the town manager, may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement to correct a violation of this article. Any person violating this article shall be subject to the full range of equitable remedies provided in the general statutes or at common law. 
d.  Correction as public health nuisance, costs as lien, etc. If the violation is deemed dangerous or prejudicial to the public health or public safety and is within the geographic limits prescribed by G.S. 160A-193, the stormwater administrator, with the written authorization of the town manager may cause the violation to be corrected and the costs to be assessed as a lien against the property. 
e.  Stop-work order. A stop-work order may be issued if an activity is being conducted or was conducted in violation of this article, any regulation, rule or order duly adopted pursuant to this article, or is being undertaken or continued for which a stormwater control plan is required except in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions of an approved plan and that either: 
1.  The activity is being conducted without an approved plan, a permit, or both; 
2.  The violation endangers life, property, or both or that such endangerment is imminent; 
3.  The activity is being conducted without installing all protective measures and devices in accordance with the approved stormwater control plan. 
All stop-work orders shall be in writing served on and directed to the person doing the work and shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be resumed. The stop-work order shall be rescinded by written notice if all the violations for which the stop-work order were issued are corrected, no other violations have occurred, and all measures necessary to abate the violations have been taken. 
(2)  Civil penalties. A violation of the provisions of this article or rules or other orders adopted or issued pursuant to this article shall subject the violator to civil penalties as follows: 
a.  Amount of civil penalty. Violation of this article may subject the violator to a civil penalty to be recovered in a civil action in the nature of a debt if the violator does not pay the penalty within 30 days after notice of the violation is issued by the stormwater administrator. Civil penalties may be assessed up to the full amount of penalty to which the town is subject for violations of its Phase II stormwater permit, or, if no Phase II stormwater permit exists for the jurisdiction, civil penalties may be assessed up to the full amount allowed by law. 
b.  Procedures to assess civil penalties. The penalties shall be assessed by the stormwater administrator. No penalty shall be assessed until the person alleged to be in violation is served written notice of the violation by registered mail, certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal service. Refusal to accept the notice shall not relieve the violator of the obligation to pay the penalty. The notice shall describe the violation with particularity and specify the measures needed to come into compliance. The notice shall designate the time within which such measures must be completed. In setting the time limit for compliance, the town shall take into consideration the quantity and complexity of the work; the consequences of delay; the potential harm to the environment, the public health, and public and private property; the cost of remedying the damage. The notice shall warn that failure to correct the violation within the specified time period will result in the assessment of a civil penalty and/or other enforcement action. If, after the allotted time period has expired, and the violation has not been corrected, the penalty shall be assessed from the date of receipt of notice of violation and each day of continuing violation thereafter shall constitute a separate violation under this section. 
c.  Failure to pay a civil penalty assessment. If the payment for the assessed civil penalty is not received, equitable settlement reached, or appeal requested within 30 days after demand for payment is made, the matter shall be referred to the town attorney for institution of a civil action in the name of the town, in the appropriate division of the superior court of justice in the county for recovering the penalty. 
d.  Appeals. If any person, having received a violation notice from the stormwater administrator or his designee desires to appeal the findings and determinations, then within ten days of receipt of the notice of violation, a written appeal shall be filed with the stormwater administrator. Said notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of the appellant; the basis for the appeal; and a request to be heard by the town manager. In the event the appeal is denied, the violation notice shall be upheld. 
(3)  Criminal penalties. Violation of this article may be enforced as a misdemeanor subject to the maximum fine permissible under state law.

accordance with a comprehensive land use plan and are designed to protect the public health,
safety and welfare; to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, and
other dangers; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid
undue concentration of population; protect the quality of the environment; and to facilitate the
adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public
requirements.
These regulations have been made with reasonable consideration, among other things, as to
the character of each district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses and with a view to
conserving the value of building and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout
the town.
Contained herein are provisions providing for the administration, amendment and enforcement
of this ordinance and defining the duties and powers of a Board of Adjustment in accordance
with the provision of the NC General Statutes and amending in its entirety the previously

Sec. 102A-106. Ordinance administrator.
This ordinance shall be administered and enforced by the Town Manager or the managers

impartial enforcement of this ordinance. All questions arising in connection with enforcement
and interpretation of this ordinance shall be presented first to the Chief Building Inspector who
is charged with the day-to-day enforcement of this ordinance. If the Chief Building Inspector
finds that they are not authorized to make a determination or judgment or that the question
automatically falls within the jurisdiction of the Board of Adjustment, then the matter shall be
referred to the board for review and decision in accordance with the provisions of Article XVII.
Sec. 102A-107. Zoning permit.
(a) Zoning permit required. It shall be unlawful to commence the excavation for or the
construction of any building or other structure, including accessory structures, or to commence
the moving, alteration or repair of any structure, or the use of any land or building, including
accessory structures, until the Chief Building Inspector has issued a zoning permit for such
work or use. Such permit shall include a statement that the plans, specifications for, and
intended use of such land or structure, in all respects, conform with the provisions of this
ordinance and Chapter 86. Application for a zoning permit shall be made in writing to the Chief
Building Inspector on forms provided for that purpose. Zoning permits shall be void after six
months from date of issue unless substantial progress on the project has been made by that
time.
(b) Approval of plans. The Chief Building Inspector shall review all applications for a
zoning permit for any purpose regulated by this ordinance and Chapter 86 for conformity with
this ordinance and Chapter 86. To this end, every application for a zoning permit shall be
accompanied by a plan or plat drawn to scale and showing the following in sufficient detail to
enable the Chief Building Inspector to ascertain whether the proposed activity is in
conformance with this ordinance and Chapter 86:

conformance with an approved site plan. The site plan shall also, without limitation, comply
with all applicable standards of Article XV.
(c) Issuance of zoning permit. If the proposed activity as set forth in the application
conforms with the provisions of this ordinance and Chapter 86, the Chief Building Inspector
shall issue a zoning permit for such purpose. If any application for a zoning permit is not
approved, the Chief Building Inspector shall state in writing on the application the cause for
such disapproval. Issuance of a permit shall in no case be construed as waiving any provision
of this ordinance or of Chapter 86 and the town reserves the right to rescind any zoning permit
mistakenly issued in contravention of the provisions of this ordinance or of Chapter 86.
Sec. 102A-108. Certificate of occupancy required.
No land or structure (except for signs) or part thereof hereafter erected, moved or altered in its

stating that such land, structure or part thereof conforms with the provisions of this ordinance
and Chapter 86. Within three days after notification that a structure or premises or part thereof
is ready for occupancy or use, it shall be the duty of the Chief Building Inspector to make a
final inspection thereof, and to issue a Certificate of Occupancy if the building or premises or
part thereof conforms with the provisions of this ordinance and Chapter 86, or if such certificate
is refused, to state the reason for the refusal in writing.
Sec. 102A-109. Bona fide farm exemption.
The provisions of this ordinance do not apply to bona fide farms. This ordinance does not
regulate or exercise controls over croplands, timberlands, pasturelands, orchards, or other
farmlands, or any farmhouse, barn, poultry house, or other farm buildings, including tenant or

ZONING DISTRICTS
(Amd. 05-05-14)
Sec. 102A-301. Establishment of districts.
For the purpose of this ordinance, the areas shown on the towns zoning map are divided into
the following classes of general, conditional and overlay districts.
Sec. 102A-302. Zone characteristics.
(a) Residential districts. Residential districts are composed of certain existing residential
areas of the town and certain areas where similar residential development appears likely to
occur. The regulations for these districts are designed to stabilize and protect the essential
characteristics of each district by promoting and encouraging a suitable environment for family
life and prohibiting certain activities of a non-residential nature. To these ends, development is
limited to dwellings which provide homes for the residents plus certain additional uses such as
schools, parks, recreation facilities, and certain other public facilities. This system of
classification is utilized to optimize orderly development by providing a variety of living
environments based on different levels of permitted population density and facilitating the
adequate provision of transportation and other public facilities.
(1) RR rural residential. A district intended for traditional rural use with lots of 20,000
square feet or above. The principal use of the land is for low-density residential and agricultural
purposes. These districts are intended to ensure that residential development not having
access to public water supplies and dependent upon septic tanks for sewage disposal will
occur at a sufficiently low density to provide a healthful environment.
(2) R-20 residential district. A district designed primarily for single-family units with a lot
area of 20, 000 square feet or above.
(3) R-15 residential district. A district designed primarily for single-family dwelling units
with a lot area of 15,000 square feet or above.
(4) R-7.5 residential district. A district designed primarily for single-family dwellings on
lots with a lot area of 7,500 square feet or above.
(5) R-6 residential district. A district designed for a mix of single- and multiple-family
dwellings.
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 30
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
(6) R-6A residential district. A district designed for a mix of single- and multiple-family
dwellings including the use of manufactured homes on individual lots and in manufactured
home parks.
(7) R-5A residential district. A district designed primarily for multiple-family housing
with a maximum density of 13.5 dwelling units per net acre.
(8) R-5 residential district. A district designed primarily for multiple-family dwelling units
with a maximum density of 29 units per acre, dependent upon the type of development.
(b) Office and institutional district.
- O&I(P) planned office and institutional district. This district is designed primarily for
agencies and offices rendering specialized services in the professions, finance, real estate,
and brokerage as well as the traditional institutional functions both public and private, public
assembly, religious and certain cultural and recreational activities and group housing. The
uses in this district classification may be characterized as having no retail or wholesale trade,
except as incidental use. The district is normally small and often situated between business
and residential areas. The regulations are designed for maintaining more compatibility with
nearby residential districts than would exist with a commercial district. To promote the
essential design features with the O&I(P) district, site plan approval is a requirement.
(c) Commercial districts.
(1) C1(P) planned local business district. This district is designed to cater to the
ordinary shopping needs of the immediate neighborhood with emphasis on convenience
goods. This district is customarily located adjacent to an arterial street and generally
surrounded by residential areas. To promote the essential design features with the C1(P)
district, site plan approval is a requirement for development proposed for the district.
(2) C2(P) planned service and retail district. This district is designed to allow for the
non-residential development of land with service and retail uses not typically considered
intrusive to neighboring residential properties or in areas generally requiring a greater degree
of restrictions regarding the commercial use of properties.
(3) C(P) planned commercial district. The intent of this district is to assure the
grouping of buildings on a parcel of land so as to constitute a harmonious, efficient and
convenient retail shopping area. To promote the essential design features within this district,
site plan approval is required. Any site plan design layout shall assure traffic safety and the
harmonious and beneficial relations between the commercial area and contiguous land.
(d) Industrial districts.
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 31
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
(1) M1(P) planned light industrial district. This district is designed for a wide variety of
light industrial operations involving manufacturing, processing, and fabrication of materials,
operations involving wholesaling and bulk storage, other non-retail uses and certain public
assembly and recreational uses. The general intent of the district is to prohibit residential,
retail, and heavy industrial uses of the land. By their nature, the uses permitted in this district
are generally not compatible with residential or shopping center uses. Access and compatibility
with the surrounding uses are the most important location criteria for light industrial districts.
To promote the essential design features with the M1(P) district, site plan approval is a
requirement.
(2) M(P) planned industrial district. This district is designed primarily for basic
manufacturing and processing industries, all of which normally create a high degree of
nuisance and are not generally compatible with residential, service or commercial uses. The
general intent of this district is to permit uses confined to wholesaling, manufacturing,
fabrication, and processing activities that can be carried on in an unobtrusive manner and
limited external effects with suitable open spaces, landscaping, parking, and service areas.
The district is customarily located on larger tracts of land with good highway and rail access
buffered from residential districts by other more compatible uses. Commercial activities are not
permitted except those having only limited contact with the general public and those not
involving the sale of merchandise at retail except for occasional temporary sale of items
produced on the premises or for the purpose of serving employees, guests and other persons
who are within the district with an industrial activity. To promote the essential design features
within the M(P) district, site plan approval is a requirement.
(e) Conservancy district.
- CD conservancy district. This district is designed to preserve and protect identifiable
natural resources from encroachment. The general intent of the district is to provide protection
for such resource areas that will continue to provide limited development potential while
preserving existing conditions to the extent feasible. Areas to be zoned in this district shall be
identifiable as any land area deemed desirable for protection from development and may
include, but not limited to: swamp, marsh, flood land, poor or very severe soils areas or
managed and unmanaged woodland on U.S. Geological Survey maps, soil maps prepared by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service or other appropriate sources.
(f) Conditional zoning districts.
(1) Companion districts (___/CZ). Each district includes a companion conditional
zoning district (e.g. RR has RR/CZ) where no uses are permitted by right. This district is
designed for the development and use of the property subject to predetermined ordinance
standards and rules imposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district and
applying it to the particular property. (Article V)
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 32
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
(2) Mixed use development - conditional zoning district (MXD/CZ). The purpose of this
district is to encourage innovative development on a conditional basis by providing use
flexibility while maintaining quality design standards tempered with proper controls regarding
buffering, landscaping, open space designation, density and other ordinance site specific or
relevant conditions. (Article VI)
(3) Planned neighborhood development - conditional zoning district (PND/CZ). A
district designed for the planned development of various residential densities concurrent with
neighborhood oriented uses in a single project. (Article VII)
(4) Density development - conditional zoning district (___/CZ). The purpose of this
district is to promote the preservation of open space within the town, through permanent
restriction of development on a percentage of a tract, buffering, and clustering of lots, while at
the same time providing for the residential development of land. The specific designation
depends on the density of the development, i.e., R20/DD/CZ. (Article VIII)
(Amd. 05-05-14)
(g) Overlay districts. The districts presented in this sub-section are created for the purpose
of providing for special regulations in given designated areas of the town to accomplish stated
purposes that are set forth for each district. These districts shall be in addition to, and shall
overlap and overlay all other zoning districts within which lands placed in each district also lie,
so that any parcel of land lying in an overlay district shall also lie in one or more of the other
zoning districts provided for by this ordinance.
(1) Airport overlay district (AOD). The purpose of this district is to protect the public
health, safety and welfare in the vicinity of the Fayetteville Regional Airport by minimizing
exposure to and giving public notice of probable high noise levels and accident hazards
generated by the airport operations and to encourage future development that is compatible
with the continued operation of the airport and the economic well being of the town.
(2) Reserved for future use.
(3) Historic overlay district (HOD). This overlay district is designed to promote the
preservation and restoration of structures and landscape features within specified areas and/or
neighborhoods of the town that are of historical, architectural and cultural importance, having
significant character, design, setting, materials or value for their association with the town,
Cumberland County, North Carolina or the nation. This district is designed to protect buildings,
structures and sites, and their environs through guidelines administered by the towns Historic
Advisory Committee.
(h) Dormant/corresponding zoning districts. This amendment makes dormant certain
previously existing zoning districts created under the towns Zoning Ordinance of 1985, and
subsequent amendments. The PND planned neighborhood district is now dormant and
development shall either comply with the standards of the R7.5 residential district or shall be

commercial district;
(2) C3 heavy commercial district shall correspond to the C(P) planned commercial
district;
(3) M2 heavy industrial district shall correspond to the M(P) planned industrial district;
and
(4) R10 residential district shall correspond to R7.5 residential district.
Sec. 102A-303. Zoning maps; interpretation of district boundaries.
(a) Zoning maps. All the territory included in the town is classified into one or more zoning
districts and the boundaries of each of these districts are hereby adopted as shown on a series

time to time be made or published, the zoning maps on file with the Planning Department and
amendments thereto entered in the minutes of the Board of Commissioners shall be final
authority as to the current zoning status of lands, buildings, and other structures in the zoning
areas.

ARTICLE V
COMPANION DISTRICTS  CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS
(Amd. 05-05-14)
Sec. 102A-501. General.
The conditional zoning districts set forth herein are authorized by N.C. GEN. STAT. §160A-382,
and are intended to modify the use to which the general zoning district is restricted. Generally,
an applicant, by seeking to rezone property to a conditional zoning district, will propose to
restrict or eliminate permitted, conditional or special uses. Request for conditional zoning
district rezoning shall be processed administratively in the same manner as for amendments to
this ordinance as established in Article XVI.
Conditional zoning districts are floating districts that parallel general zoning districts.
Conditional zoning districts are identical to their corresponding general zoning districts in all
respects except that a permit is required as a prerequisite to any use (permitted, conditional or
special) or development within them.
Parallel conditional zoning districts are provided as a voluntary alternative method of
petitioning the Board of Commissioners for a zoning map or classification change. The owner
may submit conditions that restrict the uses that would otherwise be allowed in the zoning
district and only those uses specifically requested in the application shall be considered.
(Amd. 05-05-14)
Sec. 102A-502. Restrictions on filing of applications.
A request for a conditional zoning district rezoning shall be initiated only by an application
[petition] signed by all current record owners of the affected property.
(Amd. 05-05-14)
Sec. 102A-503. Content of applications and conditions.
The conditional zoning district application shall provide the minimum information requirements
set forth below; however, additional information may be required by the staff, Zoning Board or
the Board of Commissioners when requested if any of the aforementioned deem it necessary
in order to be able to make a recommendation on, or decision regarding the application. Such
requests may include a requirement for a more detailed site plan or one modified in
accordance with additional or revised conditions and other performance criteria.
(a) Proposed uses. Proposed uses shall be set forth in detail, including the compatibility
with the uses in the neighboring districts. Any limitations or conditions to be placed on the
proposed uses to enhance compatibility with and benefit to surrounding areas shall also be set
forth.
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 48
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
(b) Dimensional requirements. The application shall show that the uses comply with
dimensional requirements for the district requested. If the applicant proposes to vary the
dimensional requirements for the district requested, it shall be demonstrated that the public
purposes to be accomplished by any such dimensional requirement are met to an equal or
greater degree.
(c) Sign requirements. The application shall indicate the location of freestanding signs in
accordance with Article XIV. If the applicant proposes to vary the sign provisions for the
district requested, it shall be demonstrated that the public purposes to be accomplished by any
such provisions are met to an equal or greater degree.
(d) Off-street parking requirements. The application shall indicate the location of all offstreet
parking and internal drive areas in accordance with Article XIII. If the applicant proposes
to vary the off-street parking provisions of this ordinance for the use requested, it shall be
demonstrated that the public purposes to be accomplished by any such provisions are met to
an equal or greater degree.
(e) Miscellaneous provisions. The application may also set forth other conditions and
performance criteria, such as days and hours of operation, numbers of employees, exterior
lighting, and noise, odor and smoke emission controls or other environmental conditions, which
might be proposed to make the use of the property compatible with surrounding areas and
uses allowed therein.
(f) Site plan requirement. The application shall include a site plan drawn to the
specifications of Sec. 102A-1502. If the proposed uses involve development subject to the
towns subdivision ordinance, the required site plan may be general in nature, showing a
generalized street pattern, if applicable, and the location of proposed uses. If the proposed
uses include development not subject to the towns subdivision ordinance, the site plan shall
be of sufficient detail to allow the staff, the Zoning Board, and the Board of Commissioners to
analyze the proposed uses and arrangement of uses on the site. It shall also include the
footprints of all buildings to be placed on the site, the proposed number of stories, and the
location and number of off-street parking and loading spaces. The site plan shall show
proposed points of access to existing streets and internal circulation patterns. In addition, the
location of all proposed buffers and fences shall be included on the site plan.
(Amd. 05-05-14)
Sec. 102A-504. Action by the Zoning Board.
The Zoning Board may hold a public hearing during which the applicant may voluntarily make
modifications to the request. The Zoning Board shall advise and comment on whether the
proposed amendment is consistent with any comprehensive plan that has been adopted and
any other officially adopted plan that is applicable. The Zoning Board shall provide a written
recommendation to the Board of Commissioners that addresses plan consistency and other
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 49
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
matters as deemed appropriate by the Zoning Board, but a comment by the Zoning Board that
a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not preclude
consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the Board of Commissioners. The
Zoning Board shall review the request for a conditional zoning district rezoning and make a
recommendation to the Board of Commissioners. When favorably recommending approval of
the conditional zoning district, the Zoning Board shall issue a statement addressing the
reasonableness of the proposed rezoning, in addition to addressing the requests consistency
with the current land use plan.
(Amd. 05-05-14)
Sec. 102A-505. Action by the Board of Commissioners.
The Board of Commissioners shall hold a public hearing to consider the conditional zoning
district rezoning and shall review the application, recommendation from the Zoning Board,
suggested conditions, and other information presented at the public hearing. When adopting or
rejecting any rezoning application, the Board of Commissioners shall also approve a statement
describing whether its action is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan for the area in
which the subject property is located and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable,
and briefly explaining why the board considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the
public interest.
In approving the application, the Board of Commissioners, with the mutual agreement of the
property owner(s), may attach such reasonable conditions as are needed (1) to address the
conformance of the development and use of the site to town ordinances and any officially
adopted comprehensive or other plan for the area in which the subject property is located and
(2) to address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of
the site. The conditions may include, but shall not be limited to:
(a) The location of the proposed use on the property;
(b) The number and location of structures;
(c) The location and extent of accessory and support facilities, such as parking lots,
driveways, fences and access streets;
(d) The location and extent of buffer areas and other special purpose areas on the
property;
(e) The height of any structure;
(f) The phasing of development;
(g) Other restrictions on the use of the property that adhere to the purposes of this
ordinance and maintain the public health, safety and welfare; and
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 50
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
(h) Such other matters as the applicant shall propose.
The record shall reflect that the property owner(s) voluntarily agree to all conditions proposed.
(Amd. 05-05-14)
Sec. 102A-506. Modification to approved conditional zoning districts.
All modifications, including changes in use and/or increase in density, to approved conditional
zoning districts and permits, other than those listed below, shall be reviewed in the same
manner as a new project.
The following minor modifications to the approved conditional zoning district may be approved
by the County Planning staff with the agreement of the town staff without reconsideration by
the Board of Commissioners, provided no variance is required, the use does not change, the
intent and layout of the approved plan is generally followed, density is not increased,
conditions of approval are not violated, and such changes do not cause a significant adverse
impact:
(a) Slight variations in the building dimensions that do not depart from the general approved
layout and not exceeding ten percent of the original approved dimensions;
(b) Minor changes in parking lot or traffic lane dimensions;
(c) Minor dimensional changes to individual lots;
(d) Minor site modifications due to necessary engineering requirements;
(e) Change of location of elements included on the site plan that generally maintains
relative alignment and orientation to the approved site plan; and
(f) Other similar insignificant changes.
In reviewing such changes, the County Planning staff and/or the town staff may require that
the modification be handled in the same manner as a new application.
(Amd. 05-05-14)
Sec. 102A-507. Time limit.
Once the conditional zoning district rezoning is approved, all conditions attached thereto shall
be binding upon the property and all subsequent development and use of the property shall be
in accordance with the approved application and conditions. Since the intent of this type of
district is to provide for workable alternative uses of property, it is intended that land will be
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 51
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
zoned in accordance with firm plans to develop. Therefore, at the end of two years from the
date of approval, the Zoning Board may examine progress made to determine if active efforts
are proceeding. If the Zoning Board determines that active efforts to develop are not
proceeding, it may institute proceedings to rezone the property to the previous zoning
classification.
(Amd. 05-05-14)
Sec. 102A-508. Failure to comply.
(a) Conditional zoning districts. If for any reason any condition imposed as part of a
conditional zoning district is found to be illegal or invalid, or if the applicant should fail to accept
any condition, the rezoning to a conditional zoning district shall be null and void and the zoning
of the property at issue shall automatically revert to its previous zoning classification.
Compliance with all conditions of a conditional zoning district is an essential element of the
conditional zoning districts continuing effectiveness. The town may use any all measures
authorized by Sections 102A-1803 and 102A-1804 to enforce the conditions of a conditional
zoning district. Moreover, if the property owner(s) fails to comply with all conditions of a
conditional zoning district, the town, in its discretion, may rezone the property to its prior zoning
district in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance, especially Article XVI.
(b) Conditional use permits. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to a
conditional use permit is found to be illegal or invalid, or if the applicant should fail to accept
any condition, the authorization of such conditional permit shall be null and void and of no
effect, and the property shall remain in, or revert to, its previous zoning classification.
Compliance with all conditions of a conditional use permit is an essential element of the
conditional use permits continued validity and effectiveness. If the County Planning Director or
the Town Manager determines that a developer has failed to comply with a condition of an
approved conditional use permit, the director and/or manager shall so notify the developer or
the developer's successor in interest in writing and shall place the matter on the Board of
Commissioners' agenda, after consideration by the Zoning Board and upon issuance of its
recommendation, for the Board of Commissioners' hearing and decision whether or not to
revoke the conditional use permit. Such hearing shall be on reasonable written notice to the
developer or the developer's successor in interest and shall be a quasi-judicial proceeding
according to quasi-judicial procedures. The decision of the Board of Commissioners shall be a
final decision, and a decision to revoke the conditional use permit may be appealed to the
Superior Court of Cumberland County within 30 days after the developer or the developer's
successor in interest has been served with written notice of the Board of Commissioners'
decision. Service by personal delivery or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a certified
copy of the Board of Commissioners' approved minutes for its meeting at which such decision
is made, shall constitute written notice and service of the Board of Commissioners' decision
hereunder. (Amd. 05-05-14)

Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 59
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
If more than one tract of land is proposed for commercial uses, no one tract shall be less than
two acres and all tracts shall be separated from each other by at least one-quarter mile
measured in a straight line.
(2) Residential uses. The maximum density of residential units per acre of the gross
land area shall be six except as provided below. In determining the maximum number of units,
the acreage denoted to commercial uses shall not be included.
The commercial land area may be proportioned if the developer wishes, i.e., three and three
quarters percent commercial and six and one-half units per acre of gross land area; two and
one-half percent commercial and seven units per acre of gross land area; one and one-quarter
percent commercial and seven and one-half units per acre of gross land area. In lieu of all
commercial development, a developer may increase the maximum residential density not to
exceed eight units per acre of gross land area.
(b) Open space and recreational facilities. Where the towns Park and Recreation Master

under the same provision and conditions as provided for in Chapter 86, or be dedicated to the
town for use as parks, recreation areas, and open space. At least 50 percent of the area
offered for dedication must be suitable for recreational use. The Board of Commissioners,
after their consideration of the Zoning Boards recommendation, shall determine that the
quality and location of the land to be dedicated is sufficient to serve the PND.
The entire dedication may be made when the preliminary plan is presented to the Board of
Commissioners; or, if the development is to be accomplished through a series of stages, the
open spaces may be dedicated in parts proportionate to the number of units to be developed
as approved in the PND plan.
No parcel of land dedicated shall be less than one contiguous acre, which shape is acceptable
to the Board of Commissioners and all such areas shall be physically a part of the PND.
Detached single-family dwelling units are exempt from any further open space dedication
requirements of Chapter 86. Residential group developments must provide the recreation
areas required by Chapter 86.
When according to adopted town plans, no land is required for recreation purposes, 15 percent
of the land shall be either placed in an owners association, under the same provision and

parks and recreation and open space; or a fee shall be paid to the Town for the acquisition of
land for recreation purposes in accordance with the provisions of N.C. GEN. STAT. § 160A-372
and Chapter 86 of the towns Code of Ordinances. The Board of Commissioners shall decide
which option is appropriate. If a fee is chosen, it shall be equivalent to 15 percent of the taxassessed
value of the land contained in the PND. The entire dedication of land or fee may be
made at the time the preliminary plan is presented for approval or may be made in proportion

not entitle the PND to additional residential units or commercial acreage.
(c) Buffer requirement. Buffers meeting the standards of Sec. 102A-1202(g) shall be
provided. The Board of Commissioners upon recommendation from the Zoning Board may
require additional buffering, when the proposed non-residential area abuts land not included in
the development plan and the required buffer would not protect the adjoining properties from
the non-residential character of the uses.
(d) Off-street parking and loading spaces. Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be
provided as required for the specific uses as listed in Article XIII.

and town staff, the Zoning Board, and the Board of Commissioners shall give considerable
weight to the following factors when formulating their recommendation/ruling:
(1) All allowed uses within the district being requested should be compatible with the
continued operation of the airport and consistent with the 2023 Off-Airport Land Use Plan, or
subsequent amendments to said plan, upon the subsequent amendments have been officially
adopted by the Board of Commissioners;
(2) Any petition for rezoning of properties located within the Airport Impact Zones, a
map of which is on file with the Town Clerk and the County Planning Department, should not
be favorably considered except where such request is consistent with the following

provisions of this ordinance. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, height limitations
shall not apply to any structure or any vegetation that is 35 feet or less in height, except when
such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend

the easement.
(h) Nonconformities. The regulations prescribed in this section shall not be construed to
require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any existing structure that is

herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure,
the construction or alternation of which valid permits have been issued prior to the effective
date of this section, and is diligently exercised. The provisions of this sub-section do not apply
to any tree, which may be trimmed in the event the tree is found to be encroaching into the
airspace zones established in sub-section (d) above.
Whenever it is determined that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or
more than 50% percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be
granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or
otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations within the AOD.

that such use is no more detrimental to the neighborhood than the initial nonconforming use of
the property in question. A change of title or possession or right to possession of property with
a nonconforming use shall not be construed to prevent the continuance of such nonconforming
use.
(d) Continuance of nonconforming structures. A structure that is nonconforming due to
noncompliance with dimensional requirements, and which is a permitted use in the district,
may continue, provided that its nonconformity is not increased. Structural changes which

value, shall be permitted. Routine repairs, maintenance, rehabilitation and renovations,
regardless of value, shall be permitted.
(e) Reconstruction prohibited. Any nonconforming structure or any structure containing a

LOT AND YARD REGULATIONS
Sec. 102A-1201. Lot regulation.
Unless otherwise established elsewhere within this ordinance or in Chapter 86, the general lot
regulations shall apply as herein set forth.
(a) One principal structure per lot. Every principal structure hereafter erected shall be
located on a lot as herein defined. In no case shall there be more than one main residential
building and its accessory buildings on one lot of record unless otherwise provided for in this
ordinance and Chapter 86. Uses that are considered accessory to the principal bona fide
farming use are not limited in number when associated with the farm use as exempted by
Section 102A-109
(b) Street access. No structure shall be erected on a lot, subject to regulation under
Chapter 86, which does not abut a public street or approved private street (see Chapter 86 for
private street provisions) for at least 35 feet, such frontage (abutting) to be continuous from the
property line to the front yard building setback line. Those lots or tracts, not regulated by
Chapter 86 shall provide, at a minimum proof of a 35-foot deeded access easement, which has
been properly and legally recorded with the County Register of Deeds, to serve the said lot or
tract.
(c) Reduction of lot size prohibited. No lot shall be reduced in area so that lot and/or yard
areas below the minimum required under this ordinance shall result. Lots 50 feet or more in
width may be treated as recorded lots less than minimum requirement.
(d) Recorded lots less than minimum requirement. Where any lot of record on the effective
date of this ordinance or amendment thereto for the zoning area in a district which allows
residential uses does not contain sufficient land to permit conformance to the dimensional
requirements of this ordinance, such lot may be used as a building site for a single-family
residence, provided that the lot area and yard dimensions are not reduced below the
minimums specified in this ordinance by more than 17 percent.
(e) Lots without community water or sewer. Any lot that is not served by public or
community water and/or sewer, in addition to the regulations of the district in which said lot is
located, must be certified by the County Public Health Department to be large enough to meet
all applicable regulations regarding water supply and/or sewage disposal prior to application
for a zoning permit.
(f) Building lines on irregularly shaped lots. The Chief Building Inspector shall determine
locations of front, side, and rear building lines on irregularly shaped lots. Such determinations
shall be based on the spirit and intent of the district regulations to achieve spacing and location
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 106
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014

of buildings or groups of buildings on individual lots. Unless specifically allowed otherwise
within this ordinance, setback lines shall not be measured from any part of any tract that does
not meet the minimum width requirement for the individual district as listed in Section 102A-
1204.
(g) Corner lots. Principal structures on corner lots shall observe the front yard
requirements on each of the intersecting streets if the principal structure is constructed and
located within developments recorded after the effective date of this ordinance, or any
amendment thereto. Except for lots located within the R6A residential district, principal
structures on corner lots in residential districts that observe the front yard requirements from
the two intersecting streets may reduce the required rear yard by 20 feet.
(h) Lot area exception in conservancy districts. In the CD conservancy district, the area
may be used as part of any contiguous zoning district for calculating density of an entire
development and satisfying setback requirements for lots within the development. That portion
of such lots within the development falling within the CD district shall only be used for open
space uses, and no principal or accessory structures shall be permitted, except boat landing
piers when permitted by applicable Federal, State, or local regulations.
Sec. 102A-1202. Yard regulation.
(a) Projection into yard space. Every part of a required yard shall be open from its lowest
point (grade level) to the sky, unobstructed except for the ordinary projections of sills, belt
courses, buttresses, cornices, ornamental features, sundecks, balconies, open porches, and
eaves; provided that none of the above projections shall project into a required yard more than
four feet. Canopies, eaves, and marquees may extend into a required yard in a commercial or
industrial district provided that no more than ten percent of the square footage within the
required yard is covered by such canopies, eaves, and marquees, and provided further that
supports for such canopies, eaves, and marquees shall not be solid and shall not interfere with
the free movement of traffic, the required off street parking, and the sight view of adjacent
properties.
Open fire escapes, outside stairways, open wheelchair ramps, the ordinary projections of
chimneys and flues, swimming pools, flag poles, decorative fountains, and other similar items
may be erected in required yards when placed so as not to obstruct light and ventilation
necessary for the structure. To minimize encroachment of wheelchair ramps into the required
yard, turning platforms are encouraged.
(b) Determination of front yard setback. The front yard requirements of this ordinance shall
not apply on lots where the average depth of existing front yards on developed lots, located
within 100 feet on each side of a lot, within the same block and zoning district as such lot, is
greater or lesser than the minimum required front lot depth. In such cases, the depth of the
front yard on such lot shall not be less than the average front yard depth on such developed
lots. This provision shall not require a structure to set back from the street or road a greater

distance than that distance set forth in this ordinance or the setback line observed by the
closer of the two existing principal structures on immediately adjoining lots. In no case,
however, shall any residential structure be placed closer than 50 feet from the centerline of a
street on which it faces or within 40 feet from the centerline of a side street. The location of a
residential structure with respect to the street line in any commercial or industrial district shall
not be used as a factor in determining the required setback from the street line for any new
structure to be erected in such districts.
(c) Fences and walls. The setback requirements of this ordinance shall not apply to any
retaining wall. Open fences and walls may be erected to any height. Solid fences and walls
shall be limited to three feet in height when projecting into or enclosing a minimum front yard
and shall be limited to seven feet in height when projecting into or enclosing a minimum side
yard or rear yard. When a corner lot follows two front yard setbacks, as determined by the
Chief Building Inspector, a solid fence or wall greater than three feet in height, but not
exceeding seven feet in height, may not be erected within 20 feet of the right-of-way on the
street deemed the secondary front yard by the Chief Building Inspector. Solid fences enclosing
a rear or side yard of a corner or through lot that are constructed of wood slats shall not
construct the wood fence so that any horizontal supports used for vertical wood slats are
located on the exterior (street) side of the solid fence. All fences shall be installed and
maintained in a safe condition and kept in good repair. The street on which the house is
addressed is usually considered the primary street on which the house must follow the full front
yard setback unless otherwise determined by the Chief Building Inspector. Exceptions to
location criteria are as follows:
(1) Fences or walls that are within or enclose the minimum side and/or rear yard of a
subdivision lot which is situated on a peripheral boundary of a subdivision in which it is a part;
(2) Rear yards on through lots may have a privacy fence erected up to the rear
property line, as determined by a platted no access easement or up to 15 feet from that line
in the absence of a no access easement;
(3) Fences erected in conjunction with a buffer, as required by sub-section (g) below,
shall be set back a sufficient width from the property line to allow for the proper maintenance
and upkeep of any required on-site vegetation; and
(4) When a principal structure is permitted closer than 25 feet to a public right-of-way
line, the fence or wall will be permitted no closer to the road right-of-way than the permitted
location of the principal structure.
(d) Corner visibility. In all districts, no fence, wall, shrubbery, sign, or other obstruction to
vision between the heights of three feet and 15 feet shall be permitted within 20 feet of the
intersection of two streets.

(e) Rear yards on through lots. The depth of rear yards on through lots shall be at least
equal to the minimum required front yards for the district in which it is located and no
accessory buildings shall be located in the rear yard on through lots.
(f) No other building in required yard space. No part of a yard or other open space
required about any structure for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this ordinance
shall be included as part of a yard or other open space required under this ordinance for
another structure. When two or more uses occupy the same building, sufficient parking areas,
yard widths, lot area, open space, and such, must be provided so that the dimensional
requirements pertaining to each of the uses will be met in full.
(g) Buffer requirements.
(1) A solid buffer shall be installed when:
a. A non-residential use abuts a residential or conservancy zoned property along
the side and/or rear property lines;
b. Any commercial off-street parking or loading space abuts a residential or
agricultural district along the side or rear property lines;
c. Any use permitted in a residential or conservancy district other than a single- or
multi-family dwelling abuts a residential or conservancy district along the side or rear property
lines;
d. Any multi-family development of more than three residential units abuts a
residential district or an existing single-family dwelling along the side or rear property lines;
e. Any outside storage of materials, equipment or products is visible and/or abutting
any residential district and/or public street; and
f. Any off-street parking facility serving a non-residential use abuts a residential
district.
(2) Governmental uses as defined herein and including public and private elementary,
junior high/middle, and high schools, accredited by the State of North Carolina, shall be
exempt from the buffer requirements of this ordinance.
(3) All uses existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance and classified under a
 e above shall provide and maintain a solid buffer completely surrounding the development
within two calendar years of said use being subject to this ordinance in accordance with the
standards of this sub-section or Chapter 86.
(4) When required by this ordinance and/or Chapter 86, the following standards shall
apply:
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 109
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
a. A vegetative buffer shall be a minimum of three feet at time of planting to reach a

b. Solid non-vegetative fencing shall have a minimum height of six feet;
c. Buffer vegetation shall be located between any fence and the common property
line.
d. Chain link fencing shall not be permitted as a screening alternative, regardless of
type of modifications made to the chain link fence.
(h) Reserved for future use.
(i) Building height. Multiple-family dwellings and office, commercial, and industrial
buildings shall not be limited to height except that for each one foot of height greater than 35
feet, the side and rear yard setbacks shall be increased by one foot. In any district, if the
structure is a combination of a one-story portion and multi-story portion, the side yard setbacks
for the structure shall be determined by the number of stories in the structure closest to the
side yard.
(j) Side yard exception. In the C1(P) planned local business district, the C2(P) planned
service and retail district and the C(P) planned commercial district, where the lot has a width of
150 feet or less at the front yard setback line, the minimum side yard width requirements shall
apply only to one side if the opposite side is also zoned for commercial or industrial uses.
(k) Rear yard exception for manufactured homes in a R6A residential district. In a R6A
residential district where a single manufactured home, as herein defined, is to be placed on an
individual lot and no other principal structure exists, and the lot adjacent to the subject lot is
also zoned R6A, the rear yard requirement may be reduced to five feet as long as such
manufactured home shall be at least 25 feet from any other manufactured home located on an
adjoining lot to the rear of the subject lot.
(l) Reserved for future use.
(m) Outdoor lighting. The purpose of this section is to reduce glare, to reduce light
trespass, to decrease the expense of lighting, to decrease light pollution, and to improve the
aesthetics of the town while still providing adequate nighttime safety and security. The
following standards are applicable to all properties:
(1) All lights shall be shielded in such a way as to direct all light toward the earths
surface and away from reflective surfaces;
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 110
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
(2) Light fixtures or lamps shall be shielded/shaded in such a manner as to direct
incident rays away from all adjacent property and any light on a pole, stand, or mounted on a
building must have a shield, and adjustable reflector and non-protruding diffuser;
(3) Any facilities, which may require floodlighting, may not arrange the light in such a
way that it will shine toward roadways, onto adjacent residential property or residentially-zoned
property or into the night sky;
(4) Any interior lighted signs may not be lit at night when any face of the sign is
removed or damaged in such a way that the light may distract pedestrians or drivers or
become a nuisance to adjacent or nearby residences;
(5) Any light fixture must be located in such a manner that no light-emitting surface is
visible from any residential area or public/private roadway, walkway, trail or other public way
when viewed at ground level.
(n) Landscaping. All requirements as set forth herein shall be applied to non-residential
and mixed use developments requiring site plan approval prior to zoning permit application for
which a zoning permit is issued on or after the adoption date of this amendment.
(1) Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this sub-section is to:
a. Enhance the community appearance and improve air quality within the town.
b. Conserve energy and retard stormwater runoff while aiding in noise, glare and
heat abatement;
c. Safeguard and enhance property value and to protect public and private
investment through the protection of significant existing trees;
d. Provide visual buffering and enhance town beautification through new
landscaping standards; and
e. Prevent the indiscriminate removal of trees and facilitate their replacement on
public and private property for new and existing developments.
(2) Minimum criteria. The detailed site plan shall include the following upon
submission for preliminary review and approval:
a. Streetscape provisions. All developments abutting a public street shall provide
within the front yard setback area a minimum of one large shade tree, ten feet in height at time
of planting, or three flowering or ornamental trees per each 50 linear feet of street frontage or
fraction thereof. The classes of trees shall be as specified by the latest edition of American
Standard for Nursery Stock published by the American Association of Nurserymen. Existing
trees within the front yard setback area can be credited toward compliance with this provision
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 111
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
provided the caliper of the existing tree(s) is a minimum of two inches. Trees shall be planted
within the front yard setback, not within the right-of-way, and may be clustered.
b. Yard space. Landscaping shall be installed for all non-residential and mixed use
development building areas where the lot is adjacent to a public street, regardless of whether
or not access to the public street is permitted. At a minimum, one ornamental tree for every 50
linear feet of building length and/or width and two shrubs for every ten linear feet of building
length and/or width. The measurement is to be taken from the side of the building facing
toward any public street. The required plant materials must be located between the structure
and the required setback line and contained within the buildable envelope, excluding the
parking areas addressed below. The development must have a yard space sufficient in size to
accommodate the required plantings and to allow room for flexibility in the landscape design.
c. Off-street parking areas. Trees and shrubbery planted pursuant to this section
shall provide at least one tree a minimum of eight feet in height and six shrubs at least 18
inches in height at time of planting for every 15 off-street spaces or fraction thereof. All
plantings shall be evenly distributed throughout the parking facility; curbed or otherwise
physically protected from motor vehicles; and landscape peninsulas, a minimum of 100 square
feet in area, shall be located no more than 15 spaces apart.
(3) Maintenance. Responsibility for maintenance and upkeep of the required plant
materials shall be the burden of by the property owner, including replacing dead or unhealthy
trees and shrubs. All yard and planting areas shall be maintained in a neat, orderly, and
presentable manner and kept free of weeds and debris.
(o) Tree preservation.
(1) Preservation of existing trees. Preserving trees can improve the aesthetic quality
of the site and improve property values, provide environmental benefits, mitigate the impacts of
development on the community, and help minimize opposition to the proposed development. It
is recommended that groups of trees be preserved, as well as individual trees. Existing
preserved trees may be credited towards required streetscape, yard and parking area trees
required in sub-section (n) above.
(2) Pre-clearing inspection required. The property owner/developer must schedule
with the Chief Building Inspector an inspection of any site to be developed prior to the clearing
and grading of the site. At the time of the inspection, all trees intended for preservation must
be marked or identified in such a manner so that it is clear which trees are to be preserved.
(3) Failure to obtain pre-clearing inspection. In the event, a site intended for
development or sale is cleared of existing trees, upon submission for development approval
and subsequent issuance of permits, the site must be developed with, at a minimum, double
the number of trees required by sub-section (n) above, in addition to any fine that may be
imposed. In the event the site is intended for residential development and has been precleared
of existing trees without approval from the Chief Building Inspector and in addition to
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 112
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
any fine that may be imposed the developer must plant or assure for plantings in the same
manner as for other improvements under the provisions of Chapter 86, one tree for each lot
proposed. Trees planted as satisfying this sub-section shall be a minimum of two inch caliper
and a minimum of eight feet in height at the time of planting.
(4) Credits for preservation of existing trees. In order to receive credit, preserved
vegetation must be in good health and condition. Trees designated to be preserved must be
indicated on the site/landscape plans in accordance with the site plan requirements of this
ordinance. Preserved trees may be credited at the rate of:
2 to 6 caliper tree = 1 tree
7 to 12 caliper tree = 2 trees
13 to 18 caliper tree = 3 trees
19 to 24 caliper tree = 4 trees
25 and up caliper tree = 5 trees
(5) Protection of preserved trees during construction. Grading or other land-disturbing
activities shall not occur on a site with existing trees which are designated to be preserved in
order to meet the landscaping requirements until protective barriers are installed by the
developer and approved by the town inspector. Trees designated for preservation which are
credited toward the landscape provisions must be protected by barriers, while other trees
intended to be preserved which do not count toward the landscape requirements are
encouraged to be protected by barriers. The barriers shall be placed around the critical root
zone of any preserved tree located within 50 feet of any grading or construction activity.
Sec. 102A-1203. Special developments.
Special developments governed elsewhere in this ordinance and those governed by the the
towns subdivision ordinance may be exempt from the lot and yard requirements of this article,
provided the development conforms with the special provisions of this ordinance and the
towns subdivision ordinance, and the overall dwelling unit density is maintained for the district
in which it is located except where specifically exempted elsewhere. This section shall
include, but not be limited to, Article VI, Mixed Use Developments-Conditional Zoning Districts
and Article VIII, Density Development-Conditional Zoning Districts, contained within this
ordinance, and zero lot line developments, unit ownership developments (condominiums and
townhouses), and manufactured home parks, which are regulated in the towns subdivision
ordinance.

Sec. 102A-1301. Minimum standards.
All uses of land and building shall be provided with adequate off-street parking and
loading space to meet the minimum standards in accordance with the provisions of this
section.
(a) Plan approval. Each application for a zoning permit, conditional zoning district,
special use permit, or certificate of occupancy shall include information as to the
location and dimensions of off-street parking and loading space and the means of
ingress and egress to such space. This information shall be in sufficient detail to enable
the Chief Building Inspector to determine whether or not the requirements of this article
are met.
(Amd. 05-05-14)
(b) Certificate of Occupancy. The Certificate of Occupancy for the use of any
building, structure, or land where off-street parking space is required shall be withheld
by the Chief Building Inspector until the provisions of this article are fully complied with.
If at any time such compliance ceases, any certificate of occupancy previously issued
for the use of the property shall immediately become void and further use of the
premises shall cease until the property is brought into compliance with this article.
(c) Permanency. The off-street parking and loading space required by this article
shall be permanent spaces and shall not be used for any other purpose unless other
spaces are provided which will fully meet the requirements of this ordinance. Except for
businesses where vehicle sales is either permitted or incidental, including but not limited
to sales lots, repair establishments, personal residences, and financial institutions
parking a vehicle for the purpose of display for sale shall be prohibited. Nothing in this
section shall be construed as preventing an employee or proprietor or patron of a
business establishment from displaying one private motor vehicle for sale during normal
working hours or in the course of conducting personal business or shopping.
(d) Permissive parking and loading facilities. Off-street parking or loading facilities
which serve any existing non-residential use of land or buildings are permitted in any
commercial or industrial district provided that all regulations herein governing the
location, design and operation of such facilities are adhered to and provided further that
whenever a parking facility serving a non-residential use abuts a residential district, a
vegetative buffer at least six feet in height shall be established between the parking
facility and the residential district.
(e) Increased intensity of existing use. When the intensity of use of any building or
premises shall be increased through addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating

capacity, or other units specified herein for the computation of required parking and
loading facilities, parking and loading facilities shall be provided for such increase in
intensity of use.
(f) Change of existing use. Whenever the existing use of a structure shall hereafter
be changed to a new use, parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required for
such new use. However, if the structure was erected prior to the effective date of this

within a shopping center may be assigned to another use provided that the hours of
operation for each use do not coincide or overlap and one-half of the parking spaces
required for churches, theaters or assembly halls whose peak attendance will be at
night or on Sundays may be assigned to a use which will be closed at night and on
Sundays.
(i) Remote parking space. If the off-street parking space required by this article for
non-residential uses cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the
principal use is located, such space may be provided on any land within 400 feet of the
main pedestrian entrance to such principal use, provided such land is in the same
ownership, by deed or long term, recorded lease, and that such land is zoned for
commercial or industrial uses. In such cases, the applicant for a permit for the principal
use shall submit with his application an instrument duly executed and acknowledged,
which subjects said land to parking use in connection with the principal use.

ARTICLE XV
PLANNED DISTRICTS
Sec. 102A-1501. General objectives.
This article recognizes that through ingenuity, imagination, and quality design
community development can be improved. All planned zoning districts shall be subject
to site plan review and approval prior to application for any permits. The careful review
of development plans by the town and County Planning Staff is a process that will:
(a) Permit creative approaches to the development of land, reflecting changes in the
technology of land development;
(b) Provide for an efficient use of land, which can result in smaller networks of
utilities and streets and thereby lower development costs;
(c) Provide and ensure an environment of stable character compatible with
surrounding land uses;
(d) Accomplish a more desirable environment than would otherwise be possible;
and
(e) Enhance the appearance of the community.
Sec. 102A-1502. Detailed site plan specifications.
In any planned district, permits shall not be issued by the Chief Building Inspector
except in conformance with a detailed plan submitted to the County Planning Staff,
reviewed by the town and County Planning Staff and approved by the Board of
Commissioners. Plans for approval shall be in the number as required by the County
Planning Director, drawn to an engineering scale of not less than one inch equaling 200
feet, and shall show all information necessary for proper evaluation of the plan,
including:
(a) The dimensions and location of the property, all existing and proposed
structures, including any existing and/or proposed freestanding signs, and existing and
proposed rights-of-way;
(b) The parking and general circulation plan, including entrances, exits, pedestrian
ways, and lateral access to adjoining commercial or industrial properties where
practical.

Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
(c) The service area, including off-street loading facilities, service drives, and
dimensions thereof and proposed uses of all structures;
(d) The proposed location and material of fences, walls, buffer and landscaping; and
(e) The name of the developer, the date, the scale, the north arrow, parcel
identification number, general vicinity sketch map, and the person or firm preparing the
plan.
Sec. 102A-1503. Site plan review.
Plans for development shall be submitted to the County Planning Staff and shall be
processed in accordance with the schedule adopted by the Board of Commissioners.
The County Planning Staff shall ensure the plan is in compliance with this ordinance
and Chapter 86 if applicable, and shall provide copies to the Town Staff for their review
and comment.
The burden shall be on the developer to show that their plans are in the best interests of
the community and the users of the proposed developments. Site planning of the
proposed development shall provide protection of the development from potentially
adverse surrounding influences and protection of surrounding areas from potentially
adverse influences within the development. The development plan shall show, and
careful review shall be given to, the following information:
(a) Proposed land uses, the location of various land uses, their types, and densities;
(b) Proposed circulation pattern for vehicles and pedestrians including providing for
the interconnectivity of drives and parking areas by means of lateral access;
(c) Proposed parks, and other common open space areas, proposed means of
dedication of any common open space areas and organizational arrangements for the
ownership, maintenance, and preservation of common open space;
(d) Delineation of the units or phases to be constructed in progression;
(e) Relation to land uses in surrounding areas and to the general development plan;
(f) The layout of motor vehicle parking and loading areas, service areas, entrances,
exits, yards, courts, landscaping, location of freestanding signs, and method control of
lighting, noise or other potentially adverse influences in order to protect the residential
character within and/or adjacent to the planned development;
(g) The yard setbacks and type of buffering and/or screening various land uses;

Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014

(h) The plan shall note and the developer shall ensure that all utilities are placed
underground, except for 25kv or greater electrical lines; and
(i) Extension and connection to public water and/or sewer, if extension and
connection would be required under the provisions of Chapter 86. If the development
consists of non-residential uses or mixed use and utilities are present within the right-ofway
or if any adjacent lot is served by utilities, extension and connection is mandatory.
Upon the planning and town staff review, the combined staff recommendations shall be
forwarded to the Board of Commissioners; the staff shall either recommend approval of
the site plan and state the conditions of recommendation, if any, or shall recommend
disapproval of the site plan and state its reasons.
Sec. 102A-1504. Board of Commissioners consideration.
The Board of Commissioners shall hear and approve the plan and state the conditions
of the approval, if any, or shall disapprove the plan and state its reasons. Where a
development plan meets the provisions of Chapter 86, approval of the development
plan shall constitute preliminary subdivision plan approval for the purposes of Chapter
86. The decision of the Board of Commissioners shall be the final decision on the plan.
The approved plan shall be filed with the Chief Building Inspector and may be amended
in the same manner as provided for original plan approval.
The Board of Commissioners may approve alternate yard setbacks for developments in
any planned zoning district if such approval will provide a more logically planned
development. The Board shall give careful consideration to the relation and effect on
the surrounding properties and the intent of this ordinance prior to granting such
approval.

Sec. 102A-1601. Submission of amendments and changes.
The Board of Commissioners may amend, supplement, change, modify, or repeal the
provisions of this ordinance, including but not limited to: its regulation of, or the number,
area, boundaries and classifications of the zoning districts, upon petition,
recommendation of the Zoning Board, or on its own motion, after public notice and
hearing as provided by law. No amendment shall become effective unless and until it is
first submitted to, considered by and reported on from the Zoning Board and thereafter
approved by the Board of Commissioners. The following provisions shall govern
submissions for amendment of this ordinance.
(a) Submission of petition. Petitions for amendments to this ordinance shall be
submitted in the form prescribed by the County Planning Staff. Submissions by the
Board of Commissioners, Zoning Board or the Town Manager on their own initiative
shall state the proposed amendment succinctly.
(b) Schedule for public hearings. All petitions for amendments may be set for public
hearing to be considered for recommendation by the Zoning Board, and then shall be
heard at public hearing and decided by the Board of Commissioners according to their
adopted regular meeting schedule.
(c) Revisions to petitions. Once the initial review of the petition for amendment has
been reviewed by the County Planning Staff or the town staff, and the petition is found
to be inaccurate, incomplete or requires revision, or if the applicant of his own accord
desires to make a change in the application for the petition, the petition may be
rescheduled to the next available scheduled hearing.
(d) Notice to military bases. All requests for amendments that would change or affect
the permitted uses of land located five miles or less from the perimeter boundary of Fort
Bragg, Pope Air Force Base, and/or Simmons Army Airfield shall be provided to the
Commander of said bases.
Sec. 102A-1602. Planning and Town Staff recommendation.
Upon submission of a complete petition for amendment of this ordinance, the County
Planning Staff and the town staff shall review the petition and the request and make a
recommendation to the Zoning Board. The staff shall take into consideration, among
other related issues, the following factors when considering criteria for their
recommendation:

(a). The appropriateness of the request in relation to, and the requests consistency
with the current Land Use Plan for the subject area;
(b) The availability of public services, to include utilities, schools, fire, police,
recreation, etc.;
(c) The suitability of the request as related to the nature of the surrounding land
area and any foreseeable effects on the surrounding area;
(d) The policies of the Zoning Board and Board of Commissioners in similar cases;
(e) The effect of the request regarding environmental concerns;
(f) Any changed conditions or circumstances in the area of a proposed change since
any previous zoning action;
(g). Whether the proposed amendment would correct an inadvertent mistake; and
(h) The reasonableness of the proposed request for all small-scale rezonings.
Sec. 102A-1603. Zoning Board hearing and recommendation.
(a) The Zoning Board, upon receipt of a proposed amendment, by petition or
otherwise, and upon a recommendation from the County Planning Staff and the town
staff, shall consider each proposed amendment and may hold public hearing, public
notice of which shall be given, for such consideration. Upon petition or other proposal
for an amendment of the ordinance for the purpose of establishing a conditional use
district or specifically changing the classification of an existing district or part thereof, the
Zoning Board may consider amending the ordinance to provide a classification or
reclassification other than that specifically requested or recommended, provided that the
notice to landowners and notice of public hearing state that classifications or
reclassifications other than that requested may be considered. If, upon receipt of a
proposal to reclassify one type of general zoning district to another, or the Zoning Board
proposes, or has a proposal from the Board of Commissioners, to consider
establishment of a conditional use district, it must refer such proposal to the owners of
the property to be included in such district for submission of a petition in accordance
with the provisions of Article V hereof; no consideration of such a proposal shall occur
unless and until such a petition is received.
(b) Following consideration of proposed amendments, supplements, changes,
modifications or repeal of provisions of this ordinance, the Zoning Board shall report all
proposals it has considered to the Board of Commissioners along with a statement
addressing consistency of the request with the current Land Use Plan and with its
recommendation thereon. Failure of the Zoning Board to make a report and

recommendation within 30 days after hearing a petition for a specific amendment shall
constitute a favorable report and recommendation for such amendment.
Sec. 102A-1604. Board of Commissioners hearing and final disposition.
(a) Upon receipt of reports and recommendations from the Zoning Board concerning
proposed amendments, supplements, changes, modifications or repeal provisions of
this ordinance, the Board of Commissioners shall schedule a public hearing, upon
notice to landowners of proposed action and notice of the public hearing as required by
law, and therefore shall approve or deny the proposed action. A failure to approve a
proposed action shall constitute a denial of the proposal.
(b) The Board of Commissioners may approve an amendment of this ordinance to
provide a classification or reclassification of a zoning district or part thereof, other than
that specifically requested by a petitioner, provided that the notice to landowners and
the notice of public hearing required by law states that classifications or reclassifications
other than that requested will be considered and further provided that the Zoning Board
has considered other such classifications or reclassifications and reported on them to
the Board of Commissioners. If such notice or such consideration has not been
accomplished, the Board of Commissioners shall refer its proposal to amend this
ordinance in a way other than that proposed by the petitioner to the Zoning Board for
further action in accordance with this ordinance.
(c) When adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the Board of Commissioners
shall also approve a statement describing whether its action is consistent with an
adopted comprehensive plan and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable,
and briefly explaining why the board considers the action taken to be reasonable and in
the public interest. Consideration of any conditional zoning district is also governed by
Article V of this ordinance.
(Amd. 05-05-14)
(d) Notice of approval of any amendment for an industrial zoning district within 660
feet of the right-of-way of interstate or primary highways shall be sent by registered mail
to the North Carolina Department of Transportation in accordance with N. C. GEN. STAT.
§ 136-153.
Sec. 102A-1605. Petitions for amendments limited; reapplication limited.
After the initial zoning process in a zoning area, a petition to amend this ordinance so as
to reclassify property in that area may be submitted at any time. After the first such
petition has been submitted, regardless of the outcome thereof, no subsequent petition,
by the same or other persons, to reclassify the same property or any portion thereof,
whether in conjunction with other property or not, shall be considered earlier than one
full calendar year after the date of the last public hearing before the Board of
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 144

Commissioners on the most recent prior application to reclassify such property or
portion thereof. A petition to amend this ordinance so as to reclassify property may be
withdrawn without establishing a new one year time limit only by a written instrument
submitted to the County Director of Planning or the Town Manager prior to the first
official notification to the public concerning the petition. If the instrument withdrawing a
petition to reclassify property is received after such first notification of the public, the
decision to allow the withdrawal without further hearing must be voted on by the Zoning
Board or the Board of Commissioners, dependent upon the status of the application at
the time the instrument requesting withdrawal is received. The foregoing time limits on
petitions to reclassify property shall not apply to amendments of any nature initiated by
the Zoning Board or Board of Commissioners.
Sec. 102A-1606. Protest petitions.
In the event of a qualified protest against a zoning map amendment, the amendment
shall not become effective except by favorable vote of three-fourths of all the members
of the Board of Commissioners. For the purposes of this sub-section, vacant positions
on the board and members who are excused from voting shall not be considered
members of the board for calculation of the requisite supermajority. To qualify as a
protest under this section, the provisions of N. C. GEN. STAT. § 160A-385 shall apply.

BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT
Sec. 102A-1701. Establishment.
The Board of Commissioners, pursuant to N.C. GEN. STAT. §160A-388, does establish a

All members and alternate members shall be residents of the town and shall serve
without pay.
Sec. 102A-1702. Proceedings.
The Board of Adjustment shall elect a chairman and vice-chairman from among its
members, who in turn may appoint a secretary. Meetings of the board shall be held at
the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board may determine. The

The Board of Adjustment shall have the powers, authority and duty to:
(a) Act in all matters relating to the administrative review of any order, requirement,

(b) Vary or modify any of the provisions of this ordinance relating to the use,
construction, or alteration of buildings or structures and minimum standards of individual
uses contained within this ordinance, in accordance with Sec. 102A-1705, where there
are unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this ordinance,
so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured,
and substantial justice done;
(c) To grant permit exceptions, called special uses, in the classes of cases or
situations and in accordance with the principles, conditions, safeguards, and procedures

Sec. 102A-1704. Appeals from decisions of administrative officials.
The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from decisions of administrative
officials charged with enforcement of the zoning ordinance and the subdivision
ordinance. As used in this section the term decision includes any final and binding
order, requirement, or determination. In addition to the requirements of Sec. 102A-1707,
appeals shall be in accordance with the following standards and requirements:
(a) Any person who has standing under G.S. 160A-393(d) or the Town may appeal
a decision to the Board of Adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal
with the Town Clerk or County Planning Staff. The notice of appeal shall state the
grounds for the appeal.
(b) The town shall give written notice to the owner of the property that is the subject
of the decision and to the party who sought the decision, if different from the owner. The
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 147
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
written notice shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class
mail.
(c) The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the written notice
within which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal shall have 30
days from receipt from any source of actual or constructive notice of the decision within
which to file an appeal.
(d) It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to appeal have
constructive notice of the decision from the date a sign containing the words Zoning
Decision or Subdivision Decision in letters at least six inches high and identifying the
means to contact an official for information about the decision is prominently posted on
the property that is the subject of the decision, provided the sign remains on the
property for at least 10 days. Posting of signs is not the only form of constructive notice.
Any such posting shall be the responsibility of the landowner or applicant. Verification of
the posting shall be provided to the official who made the decision. This subdivision
does not obligate the town to post any signs.
(e) The official who made the decision shall transmit to the Town Clerk or County
Planning staff all documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from is taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the
appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if the
appellant is not the owner.
(f) An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement
of the action appealed from unless the official who made the decision certifies to the
Board of Adjustment after notice of appeal has been filed that because of the facts
stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or because
the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of
the ordinance. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a
restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not
stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the
appeal, and the board of adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after
such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a
permit or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the
ordinance shall not stay the further review of an application for permits or permissions to
use such property; in these situations the appellant may request and the board may
grant a stay of a final decision of permit applications or building permits affected by the
issue being appealed.
(g) Subject to the provisions of subdivision (f) of this subsection, the Board of
Adjustment shall hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time.
(h) The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing as a witness.
The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in the notice of
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 148
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
appeal. If any party or the Town would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation of
matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the Board shall continue the hearing. The
Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision
appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that
ought to be made. The board shall have all the powers of the official who made the
decision.
(Amd. 05-05-14)
Sec. 102A-1705. Variance.
The Board of Adjustment may authorize in specific cases such variances from the terms
of this ordinance upon request of a property owner or his authorized agent and may
require any evidence necessary to make a determination of the case. Before the board
may grant any variance, the board must find that all of the following conditions exist for
an individual case:
(a) Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It
shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no
reasonable use can be made of the property.
(b) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as
location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well
as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the
general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance
(c) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property
owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that
may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.
(d) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of this
ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.
Any variance granted becomes null and void if not exercised within the time specified in
such approvals, or if no date is specified, within one calendar year from the date of such
approval. The Board of Adjustment is not authorized to grant variances to any use
approved in a conditional zoning district or to the specific conditions or other
performance criteria imposed upon such use. If the board denies the variance request,
it shall enter the reason for its action in the minutes of the meeting at which the action is
taken. In the event of a denial, the Board of Adjustment shall not consider re-submission
of the application for the same variance request on the same property without a
substantial material change concerning the property and the application.

Sec. 102A-1706. Special use permits.
The various special uses set forth in the use matrix in Article IV, because of special site
or design requirements, operating characteristics or potential adverse effects on
surrounding property and neighborhoods, shall be permitted only upon approval by the
Board of Adjustment in accordance with the standards and conditions as set forth in this
section.
(a) Purpose. Permitting special uses adds flexibility to this ordinance. Subject to
high standards of planning and design, certain property uses are allowed in the several
districts where these uses would not otherwise be acceptable. By means of controls
exercised through the special use permit procedures, property uses that would
otherwise be undesirable in certain districts can be developed to minimize any negative
effects they might have on surrounding properties.
(b) Procedure. Special use permits shall be granted by the Board of Adjustment as
permitted for only those uses enumerated in Sec. 102A-403 (use matrix) as special
uses. Uses specified as a special use in Sec. 102A-403 shall be permitted only upon
the issuance of a special use permit by the Board of Adjustment.
The owner or owners of all property included in the petition for a special use permit shall
submit a complete application and five copies of a detailed site plan (drawn in
accordance with the specifications listed in Sec. 102A-1503) to the County Planning
Staff. The staff will schedule the application to be heard by the Board of Adjustment in
accordance with the adopted time schedule. The Town Clerk shall also notify the
commanders of the military bases of any application affecting the use of property
located within five or less miles of the perimeter boundary of said bases.
Developers are encouraged to discuss their special use plans with the County Planning
and Town Staff prior to submission of the application. The staff shall assist the
developer upon request by reviewing special use plans to ensure that the technical
requirements of this ordinance are met before submission to the Board of Adjustment.
(c) Consideration of application. The Board of Adjustment shall consider the
application, site plan and any other evidence presented in accordance with this article
and may grant or deny the special use permit requested. In granting a special use
permit, the board shall find that:
(1) The use will not materially endanger the public health or safety if located
according to the plan submitted and proposed;
(2) The use meets all required conditions and specifications;
(3) The use will maintain or enhance the value of adjoining or abutting
properties, or that the use is a public necessity; and

Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
(4) The location and character of the use, if developed according to the plan as
submitted and recommended, will be in harmony with the area in which it is to be
located and is in general conformity with Hope Mills most recent and officially adopted
land use plan, either comprehensive or a detailed area plan.
(d) Final disposition. In granting approval of a special use permit, the Board of
Adjustment shall impose such reasonable terms and conditions as it may deem
necessary for the protection of the public health, general welfare and public interest. In
granting a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment may give due consideration to
any or all of the following:
(Amd. 05-05-14)
(1) The compatibility of the proposal, in terms of both use and appearance, with
the surrounding neighborhood;
(2) The comparative size, floor area and mass of the proposed structure in
relationship to adjacent structures and buildings in the surrounding area and
neighborhood;
(3) The frequency and duration of various indoor and outdoor activities and
special events, and the impact of these activities on the surrounding area;
(4) The capacity of adjacent streets to handle increased traffic in terms of traffic
volume, including hourly and daily levels and weight-bearing limitations;
(5) The added noise level created by activities associated with the proposed use;
(6) The requirements for public services where the demands of the proposed use
are in excess of the individual demands of the adjacent land uses, in terms of police and
fire protection, and the presence of any potential or real fire hazards created by the
proposed use;
(7) Whether the general appearance of the neighborhood will be adversely
affected by the location of the proposed use on the parcel;
(8) The impact of night lighting in terms of intensity, duration and frequency of
use, as it impacts adjacent properties and in terms of presence in the neighborhood;
(9) The impact of the landscaping of the proposed use, in terms of maintained
landscaped areas, versus areas to remain in a natural state, as well as the openness of
landscaped areas, versus the use of buffers and screens;
(10) The impact of a significant amount of hard-surfaced areas for buildings,
sidewalks, drives, parking areas and service areas, in terms of noise transfer, water
runoff and heat generation;
Hope Mills Zoning Ordinance 151
Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
(11) The availability of public facilities and utilities;
(12) The harmony in scale, bulk, coverage, function and density of the proposed
development and compliance with the development standards of the individual uses;
and
(13) The reasonableness of the request as compared to the purpose and intent
of the most recent land use plan, this ordinance, and officially adopted policies, for the
physical development of the district, and protection of the environment.
All such additional conditions shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting, at which
the special use permit is granted, on the special use permit itself, and on the approved
plans submitted therewith. The specific conditions shall run with the land and shall be
binding on the original applicants for the special use permit, their heirs, successors and
assigns. The applicant for the special use permit is responsible for the recordation of
the Notice of Special Use Permit with the County Register of Deeds prior to application
for any zoning/building permit.
If the board denies the special use permit, it shall enter the reason for its action in the
minutes of the meeting at which the action is taken. In the event of a denial, the Board
of Adjustment shall not consider re-submission of the application for the same special
use permit on the same property without a substantial material change concerning the
property and the application.
(e) Expiration of permits. Any special use granted becomes null and void if not
exercised within the time specified in such approval, or if no date is specified, within one
calendar year from the date of such approval. Furthermore, once the Certificate of
Occupancy has been issued for a special use and then the special use ceases to exist
for a time period of one calendar year or more, a re-submittal of the special use
application for the same use may be required if there has been a material change in the
ordinance standards.
(f) Modifications to plans. The Board of Adjustment shall review any change,
enlargement or alteration in site plans submitted as a part of a special use application,
and new conditions may be imposed where findings require. The County Planning and
Town Staff may approve minor modifications of the approved plans in the same manner
as authorized in Sec. 102A-508 for conditional zoning districts, provided that the
changes do not materially alter the original plan as approved, and the intent and
objectives of the original approval are not deviated from.
(Amd. 05-05-14)
(g) Noncompliance. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to this
section is found to be illegal or invalid, the special use permit shall be null and void and
of no effect, and the County Planning or Town Staff shall institute proceedings for the
case to be reheard by the Board of Adjustment.

Compliance with all the conditions of a special use permit is an essential element of the
special use permits continued validity and effectiveness. If the Chief Building Inspector
determines that a permittee has failed to comply with a condition of an approved special
use permit, they shall so notify the permittee or the permittees successor in interest and
shall place the matter on the Board of Adjustments agenda for the boards decision
whether or not to revoke the special use permit. Such hearing shall be on reasonable
written notice to the permittee or the permittees successor in interest and shall be a
quasi-judicial proceeding according to quasi-judicial procedures. The decision of the
Board of Adjustment shall be a final decision, and a decision to revoke the special use
permit may be appealed to the Superior Court of Cumberland County within 30 days
after the permittee or the permittees successor in interest has been served with written
notice of the Board of Adjustments decision. Service by personal delivery or certified
mail, return receipt requested, of a certified copy of the Board of Adjustments approved
minutes for its meeting at which such decision is made, shall constitute written notice
and service of the Board of Adjustments decision hereunder.
(h) Appeals. No appeal may be taken from the action of the Board of Adjustment in
granting or denying a special use permit except through the Superior Court of
Cumberland County in the same manner as set forth in this article for appeal of any
Board of Adjustment decision.
Sec. 102A-1707. Hearings and decisions.
(a) Hearings. Any appeal, variance or special use permit application considered by
the Board of Adjustment requires a quasi-judicial hearing. The board shall fix a
reasonable time for hearing and give public notice as well as due notice to the parties in
interest. Each quasi-judicial hearing shall follow quasi-judicial requirements including
sworn testimony, the reliance on competent evidence, the right to question witnesses,
avoiding ex parte contact and bias and matching up evidence to findings of fact. At the
hearing, any person or party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.
(b) Decisions. The board shall determine contested facts and make its decision
within a reasonable time. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent,
material, and substantial evidence in the record. Each quasi-judicial decision shall be
reduced to writing and reflect the boards determination of contested facts and their
application to the applicable standards. The written decision shall be signed by the
Chair or other duly authorized member of the board. A quasi-judicial decision is effective
upon filing the written decision with the Town Clerk. The decision of the board shall be
delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail to the applicant,
property owner, and to any person who has submitted a written request for a copy, prior
to the date the decision becomes effective. The person required to provide notice shall
certify that proper notice has been made.

Sec. 102A-1708. Required vote.
The concurring vote of four-fifths of the members of the board shall be necessary to
grant and to decide in favor of an applicant on any matter, including variances.
Decisions for all matters not a variance shall be made by the majority vote of the board
members.
(Amd. 05-05-14)
Sec. 102A-1709. Reversal of decision.
After a public hearing has been held and approval granted for a special use or variance,
the Board of Adjustment may reverse any decision upon finding that the:
(a) Approval was obtained by fraud;
(b) Use for which such approval was granted is not being executed;
(c) Use for which such approval was granted has ceased to exist or has been
suspended for one year or more;
(d) Permit granted is being, or recently has been, exercised contrary to the terms of
conditions of such approval or in violation of any regulation or statute; or
(e) Use for which the approval was granted was so exercised as to be detrimental
to the public health or safety, or so as to constitute a nuisance.
Sec. 102A-1710. Appeal of final decision.
Every quasi-judicial decision shall be subject to review by the Cumberland County
Superior Court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari pursuant to G.S. 160A-393. A
petition for review shall be filed with the Clerk of Superior Court by the later of 30 days
after the decision is effective or after a written copy thereof is given in accordance with
Sec. 102A-1707. When first-class mail is used to deliver notice, three days shall be
added to the time to file the petition.

ARTICLE XVIII
LEGAL PROVISIONS
Sec. 102A-1801. Severability clause.
If any article, section, sub-section, sentence, clause or phrase of this ordinance is for
any reason held to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
portions of this ordinance. The Board of Commissioners hereby declares that it would
have passed this ordinance and each article, section, sub-section, sentence, clause and
phrase thereof individually, irrespective of the fact that any one or more articles,
sections, sub-sections, sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared invalid.
Sec. 102A-1802. Vested rights.
The purpose of this section is to implement the provisions of N. C. GEN. STAT. 160A-
385.1 pursuant to which a statutory zoning vested right is established upon the approval
of a site specific development plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither a variance, a
sketch plan nor any other document that fails to describe with reasonable certainty the
type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property shall constitute a
site specific development plan.
(a) Establishment zoning vested right.
(1) A zoning vested right shall be deemed established upon the valid approval,
or conditional approval, by the Board of Commissioners or Board of Adjustment, as
applicable, of a site specific development plan, following notice and public hearing.
(2) The approving authority may approve a site specific development plan upon
such terms and conditions as may reasonably be necessary to protect the public health,
safety and welfare.
(3) Notwithstanding sub-sections (1) and (2) of this sub-section, approval of a
site specific development plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall not
confer a zoning vested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained.
(4) A site specific development plan shall be deemed approved upon the
effective date of the approval authority's action relating thereto.
(5) The establishment of a zoning vested right shall not preclude the application
of conditions in a conditional zoning district that imposes additional requirements
attached to the permit but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or
ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property
subject to land-use regulation by the town, including, but not limited to, building, fire,

plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes. Otherwise applicable new or amended
regulations shall become effective with respect to property that is subject to a site
specific development plan upon the expiration or termination of the vested right in
accordance with this article.
(Amd. 05-05-14)
(6) A zoning vested right is not a personal right, but shall attach to and run with
the applicable property. After approval of a site specific development plan, all
successors to the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such right while
applicable.
(b) Approval procedures and approval authority.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an application for site specific
development plan approval shall be processed in accordance with the procedures
established by ordinance and shall be considered by the designated approval authority
for the specific type of zoning or land use permit or approval for which application is
made.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions in this section, if the authority to issue a
particular zoning or land use permit or approval has been delegated by code to a board,
committee or administrative official other than the Board of Commissioners or the Board
of Adjustment, in order to obtain a zoning vested right, the applicant must request in
writing at the time of application that the application be considered and acted on by the
Board of Commissioners or Board of Adjustment, following notice and a public hearing
as provided in N. C. GEN. STAT. § 160A-364.
(3) In order for a zoning vested right to be established upon approval of a site
specific development plan, the applicant must indicate at the time of application, on a
form to be provided by the Town, that a zoning vested right is being sought.
(4) Each map, plat, site plan or other document evidencing a site specific
development plan shall contain the following notation:
Approval of this plan establishes a zoning vested right under N. C. GEN. STAT.
160A-385.1., unless terminated at an earlier date, the zoning vested right shall
be valid until _________.
(5) Following approval or conditional approval of a site specific development
plan, nothing in this section shall exempt such a plan from subsequent reviews and
approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval,
provided that such reviews and approval are not inconsistent with the original approval.
(6) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the revocation of the original approval or
other remedies for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions of the approval
or this ordinance.

(c) Duration.
(1) A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this section shall remain
vested for a period of two years unless specifically and unambiguously provided
otherwise pursuant to subsection (2) of this sub-section. This vesting shall not be
extended by any amendments or modifications to a site specific development plan
unless expressly provided by the approval authority at the time the amendment or
modification is approved.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-section (1) of this sub-section, the
approval authority may provide that rights shall be vested for a period exceeding two
years but not exceeding five years where warranted in light of all relevant
circumstances, including, but not limited to, the size of the development, the level of
investment, the need for or desirability of the development, economic cycles, and
market conditions. These determinations shall be in the sound discretion of the approval
authority at the time the site specific development plan is approved.
(3) Upon issuance of a building permit, the expiration provisions of N.C. GEN.
STAT. § 160A-418 and the revocation provisions of N.C. GEN. STAT. § 160A-422 shall
apply, except that a building permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the
running of time while a zoning vested right under this section is outstanding.
(d) Termination. A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this section
shall terminate:
(1) At the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and
uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed;
(2) With the written consent of the affected landowner;
(3) Upon findings by the Board of Commissioners, after notice and public
hearing, that natural or manmade hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the
property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety, and
welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the site specific development
plan;
(4) Upon payment to the affected landowner of compensation for all costs,
expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not limited to, all
fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal,
and other consultant's fees incurred after approval by the town, together with interest
thereon at the legal rate until paid. Compensation shall not include any diminution in the
value of the property which is caused by such action;

Adopted/Effective: October 20, 2008
Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014
Reprinted on July 15, 2014
(5) Upon findings by the Board of Commissioners, after notice and hearing,
that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or
made material misrepresentations which made a difference in the approval by the
approval authority of the site specific development plan; or
(6) Upon the enactment or promulgation of a State or Federal law or other
regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the site specific development
plan, in which case the approval authority may modify the affected provisions, upon a
finding that the change in State or Federal law or other regulation has a fundamental
effect on the plan, after notice and hearing.
(e) Voluntary annexation. A petition for annexation filed with the town under N.C.
GEN. STAT. § 160-31 or N.C. GEN. STAT. § 160A-58.1 shall contain a signed statement
declaring whether or not any zoning vested right with respect to the properties subject to
petition has been established under N.C. GEN. STAT. § 160A-385.1 or N.C. GEN. STAT. §
153A-344.1. A statement declaring that no zoning vested right has been established
under N.C. GEN. STAT. § 160A-385.1 or N.C. GEN. STAT. § 153A-344.1, or the failure to
sign a statement declaring whether or not a zoning vested right has been established,
shall be binding on the landowner and any such zoning vested right shall be terminated.
(f) Limitations. Nothing in this section is intended or shall be deemed to create any
vested right other than those established pursuant to N.C. GEN. STAT. § 160A-385.1.
Sec. 102A-1803. Violations.
(a) Statutory authority. This ordinance may be enforced by any appropriate
equitable action, including but not limited to, injunction and abatement, in addition to any
other remedy authorized by N.C. GEN. STAT. § 160A-389.
(b) Notice of civil citation. If the Chief Building Inspector determines that any
provision of this ordinance is being violated, the inspector shall cause to be served upon
the offender or its agent, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal
service, a notice of civil citation. The notice of civil citation shall indicate the nature of
the violation and order the action necessary to correct it. The citation shall also state
the monetary penalty and the right of the offender to appeal the violation that is the
basis of the citation to the Board of Adjustment within ten days from the date of service
of the citation.
(c) Responsible parties. The owner, lessee, tenant or occupant of any building or
land or part thereof and any architect, builder, contractor, agent or any other person
who participates in, assists, directs, creates or maintains any violation of the provisions
of this ordinance may be held responsible for the violation and be liable for the penalties
and be subject to the remedies provided below.

Updated w/ Amendments Thru June 23, 2014

(d) Separate offense. Each day that any violation continues after notification by the
Chief Building Inspector that such violation exists shall be considered a separate
offense for purposes of penalties and remedies specified herein.
(e) Appeal of citation. If the offender files notice of appeal to the Board of
Adjustment within the ten-day time period established in (b) above, the appeal shall stay
the collection of the penalty so imposed as well as the corrective action prescribed in
the citation. Appeals to the Board of Adjustment shall be administered as provided in
Article XVII; however, the time for perfecting the appeal shall be ten days as
hereinbefore stated. A violation of this ordinance may not be appealed to the Board of
Adjustment if the offender did not perfect an appeal to the Board of Adjustment within
the ten-day time period set forth herein.
(f) Emergency enforcement. Notwithstanding the forgoing, in cases where delay
would seriously threaten the effective enforcement of this ordinance or pose a danger to
the public health, safety or welfare, the Chief Building Inspector may seek enforcement
of this ordinance without prior written notice by invoking any of the penalties or
remedies herein authorized.
Sec. 102A-1804. Penalty.
A person who violates any of the provisions of this ordinance shall be subject to
revocation of any permits and a civil penalty in the sum of $500.00 following the
issuance of a civil citation. The penalty shall be recovered by the Town in a civil action if
the offender fails to pay the penalty to the Finance Director, Town of Hope Mills, 5770
Rockfish Road, Hope Mills, North Carolina 28348, within ten calendar days after being
cited for the violation. The civil action of recovery shall be in the nature of an action to
recover a debt and shall include as an additional sum to be recovered the full costs of
the action, including but not limited to, filing, service and attorney fees. Second and
subsequent violations shall subject the offender to a $500.00 penalty. Nothing in this
section shall preclude the enforcement of this ordinance pursuant to the all of the
provisions of N.C. GEN. STAT. §14-4 where appropriate.
Sec. 102A-1805. Amendment clause.
This ordinance, upon its effectiveness as provided by law, amends in its entirety the

(4) Location. The offered recreation area shall be located so to reasonably
serve the recreational needs of the residents within the development. The Parks
and Recreation Director may require that the recreation area be located on the
periphery of the development in order to allow its enlargement by combining the
recreation area with that of adjacent developments when adjacent property is
publicly owned or when there are officially adopted plans that identify the area as
future recreation area to be acquired by the Town. The Parks and Recreation
Director, with final approval from the Town Board of Commissioners, may negotiate
the location of the land or fee when it is deemed in the best interest of the immediate
