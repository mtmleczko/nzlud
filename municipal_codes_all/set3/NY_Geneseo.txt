§ 60-1. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and promote the public health,
safety and general welfare by eliminating avoidable false fire and burglar
alarms and thereby ensuring that fire and police facilities and personnel

This chapter applies to all installed fire and burglar alarms which are
directly connected to a police or fire agency or to a private agency which,
in turn, makes a connection to a police or fire agency or to no agency but
merely sounds an alarm on the premises, each installed alarm having the
purpose of notifying police and/or fire agencies that an emergency exists at
§ 52-1 GENESEO CODE § 60-2

police or fire agency. This chapter does not apply to state, county, town,

§ 60-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings as
indicated:
AVOIDABLE FALSE ALARM — Any false alarm received by a local police or
fire agency from an installed alarm which is caused by improper installation
of the system, by a mechanical failure or malfunction of the system or
is due to negligence on the part of the owner, user, custodian or other
person responsible for the installed alarm. An avoidable false alarm does
not include an alarm activated by a natural phenomenon, such as a tornado,
earthquake or the like, or by acts of third parties which are beyond control
of the person responsible for the installed alarm; all other false alarms are
prima facie avoidable false alarms prohibited by this chapter.
INSTALLED ALARM — Any mechanical or electrical device installed in a
building for the purpose of automatically notifying, directly or indirectly,
police or fire agencies when a break-in or fire occurs and used for the
purpose of summoning help from police or fire agencies.
§ 60-4. Permits; fee; application.
A. Effective immediately, a Village permit is required for the installation
and/or operation of any installed alarm which serves to alert, either
directly or indirectly, the Geneseo Village Police and/or Fire
Department. Permits for those installed alarms which are now in
operation must be obtained within 60 days of the effective date of this
chapter.
B. Permits, which include a list of penalties for infractions, are issued by
the Village Clerk upon payment of a five-dollar fee and upon completion
of an application which requires the following information:
(1) Date of application.
(2) Type of alarm.
(3) Name and address of person responsible for the alarm.
(4) Address and extent of premises protected by alarm.
(5) Location of enunciator panel(s).

development permits in accordance with its provisions.
§ 65-11. Floodplain development permit.
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of protecting its
citizens from increased flood hazards and ensuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 65-6, without a valid floodplain development permit.
Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the Local
Administrator and may include but not be limited to plans, in duplicate,
drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions and
elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials and drainage facilities and the location of the
foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee of $25. In addition, the applicant
shall be responsible for reimbursing the Village of Geneseo for any
additional costs necessary for review, inspection and approval of this
project. The local administrator may require a deposit of no more than
$500 to cover these additional costs.
§ 65-8 GENESEO CODE § 65-11
1:66
C. Application for permit. The applicant shall provide the following
information, as appropriate. Additional information may be required on
the permit application form.
(1) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest
floor (including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially
improved structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH, or
Zone A if base flood elevation data are available. Upon completion
of the lowest floor, the permittee shall submit to the local
administrator the as-built elevation, certified by a licensed
professional engineer or surveyor.
(2) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any
new or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be
floodproofed. Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the
structure, the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the
as-built floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer
or surveyor.
(3) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 65-14C, Utilities.
(4) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the
floodproofing criteria in § 65-16, Nonresidential structures.
(5) A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by
a licensed professional engineer must be submitted that
demonstrate that the altered or relocated segment will provide
equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. The
applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
to revise the documents enumerated in § 65-6, when notified by the
local administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed
by FEMA for this purpose. The applicant must also provide
assurances that the conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated
stream segment will be maintained.
(6) A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required
by the local administrator, which shows whether proposed
development to be located in an area of special flood hazard may
result in physical damage to any other property.
(7) In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data is available from other
sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit
applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments (including proposals for manufactured home and
recreational vehicle parks and subdivisions) that are greater than
either 50 lots or five acres.
§ 65-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 65-12
1:67
§ 65-12. Duties and responsibilities of local administrator.
Duties of the local administrator shall include but not be limited to the
following:
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 65-11C, Application for permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of §§ 65-13 through 65-17 regarding
construction standards and, in particular, § 65-13A, Subdivision
proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
§ 65-13, General construction standards, no permit shall be issued.
The applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.
(1) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated
areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 65-11C(7), as criteria for requiring that
new construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
§ 65-12 GENESEO CODE § 65-12
1:68
(2) When base flood elevation data is not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses.
(1) Notification to adjacent communities and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submittal of evidence
of such notification to the Regional Director, Region II, Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance

following factors:
(1) The general design, character and appropriateness to the property
of the proposed alteration or new construction.

significance of the property.

approval, the owner shall file an application for such a certificate with

lieu of any building permit that may be required by any other ordinance

office for public inspection. The HRB's decision shall state the reasons
for denying or modifying any application.
A. An applicant whose certificate of approval has been denied may apply
for relief on the ground of hardship. In order to prove the existence of

applicant by registered mail and a copy filed with the Village Clerk's
office for public inspection. The HRB's decision shall state the reasons
for granting or denying the hardship application.
A. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance, repainting and repair of any exterior architectural
feature of a landmark or property within an historic district which does
not involve a change in outward appearance.
B. No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as a
landmark or included within an historic district shall permit the
property to fall into a serious state of disrepair so as to result in the
deterioration of any exterior architectural feature which would, in the

of the historic district as a whole or the life and character of the
property itself.

provision of any law, ordinance, regulation or private agreement, the
provisions of this chapter shall control. Where greater restrictions are

imposed by this chapter, such greater restrictions shall not be affected by
this chapter.

in the termination of any permits issued or any proceedings
commenced under the provisions of this chapter, and penalties for
offenses thereof shall be under the enforcement procedures laws of the
Village. Penalties shall be consistent with the Village Zoning
Ordinance10 for violations, as an offense.

drain resources, often require police and/or emergency responses, and

§ 87-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 87-10
1:115
§ 88-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and cited as the Social Host Law of the Village
of Geneseo.
§ 88-2. Applicability.
The regulations of the Social Hosts chapter shall apply to and affect real
property and structures thereon that are permitted to be used for
residential uses, including residential uses that are located in
nonresidential zones.
§ 88-3. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to protect the public interest, welfare,
health and safety within the Village of Geneseo by prohibiting the service
to and consumption of alcoholic beverages and illegal drugs by persons
under age of 21 at private residences located in the Village. The Village
Board finds that the occurrence of social gatherings at private residences
where alcoholic beverages or illegal drugs are served to or consumed by
persons under the age of 21 is harmful to such persons themselves and a
threat to public welfare, health and safety. The Village Board finds further
that persons under the age of 21 often obtain alcoholic beverages or illegal
drugs at such gatherings and that such service and/or consumption will be
more likely to ensure that alcoholic beverages and illegal drugs are neither
served to nor consumed by persons under the age of 21 at these gatherings.
§ 88-4. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES — Shall mean any liquor, wine, beer, spirits, cider

as provided in Section 12 of Section 200 of the Agriculture and Markets
Law shall not be considered alcoholic beverage within the meaning of this

direct or dominate private premises, including but not limited to the control
exercised by tenants, lessees, owners and/or landlords who have noticed
drinking on their premises.

to take place at said residence if such person knows or has reason to know
that any alcoholic beverage or illegal drug is being unlawfully possessed,
served to or consumed by a minor at said residence. Such person must take
reasonable corrective action to ensure that the possession or consumption
of alcoholic beverages or illegal drugs by any minor on such premises is
prohibited. Reasonable corrective action shall include, but not limited to:
§ 88-6. Exceptions.
The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to:
§ 88-7. Severability.
A. Verifying the age of persons attending the social gathering by

regulation shall prevail.
B. If any part or provision of this chapter or the application thereof to any
person or circumstance be adjudged invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its operation to the part
or provision of or application directly involved in the controversy in
which such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not affect or

§ 88-8. Penalties for offenses.
Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a
violation and shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to a fine of $250, or

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 96-1. Title.
This chapter will be known as the "Geneseo Rental Housing Law," and will
be referred to as such in this chapter.
§ 96-2. Findings and purpose.
The Board of Trustees has determined that there exist in the Village of
Geneseo issues arising from the rental of dwelling units that may be
substandard or in violation of the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention
and Building Code, the New York State Multiple Residence Law, or other
state codes or local codes; dwelling units that are inadequate in size,
overcrowded and dangerous, that tend to promote or encourage
deterioration of the housing stock of the Village, create blight, excessive
vehicular traffic and parking problems and that tend to overburden
municipal services. The Board finds that the Village has transient residents,
many of whom occupy rental housing within the Village and whose members
have generated a disproportionate number of complaints of public
nuisances, including but not limited to noise, property damage, and
property neglect; that the current Code of the Village of Geneseo ("Village
Code") lacks sufficient incentives for owners to regulate the conduct of
their tenants; and that the Village Code lacks sufficient safeguards on
the population densities of rental housing. The Board further finds that
current Village Code provisions must be enforced to halt the proliferation of
such conditions and that the public health, safety, welfare, good order and
governance of the Village will be enhanced by enactment of the regulations
set forth in this chapter, which regulations are remedial in nature and effect.
§ 96-3. Citation; copies available.
§ 96-4. Effect on other laws.
This chapter supplements and/or incorporates the requirements contained
in the State Building Code, the State Property Maintenance Code, and
the State Multiple Residence Law. In the event of a conflict between the
aforementioned codes and this chapter, the most restrictive requirements
shall prevail to the extent permitted under applicable law. This chapter is
intended to supplement rather than supersede existing state law.
§ 96-5. Scope, applicability and exceptions.
A. This chapter and all provisions incorporated in this chapter, by
reference or otherwise, shall be known as the "Geneseo Rental Housing
Law," shall be cited as such and will be referred to in this chapter as
such and as "this local law" or as "this chapter."
B. An official copy of this chapter and a certified copy of this chapter may
be obtained from the office of the Village Clerk.
§ 96-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 96-5
1:121
A. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the maintenance, repair,
use and occupancy of all residential rental buildings and structures now
in existence or hereafter constructed, rehabilitated, renovated or
converted to residential use within the Village limits, except those
buildings and structures specifically excluded from the provisions of
this chapter and public nuisance structures as defined herein. Any
structure that was in compliance on the day previous to the adoption of
this chapter will be allowed to remain, except if:
(1) Such structure is substantially damaged by fire or other causes;
(2) Any state, county or local code requires changes to existing
structures.
B. The legal occupancy of any rental building or structure existing on the
date of adoption of this chapter shall be permitted to continue without
change, except such changes as are specifically required to be made to
existing rental buildings or structures in this chapter, the New York
State Rental Housing Law, the New York State Building Code, the
Property Maintenance Code of New York State or the Fire Code of New
York State.
C. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to change the validity of or
requirements for a certificate of occupancy under the Building Code of
New York State.
D. Exceptions. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to:
(1) Buildings, structures and uses owned and operated by any
governmental unit or governmental agency, including the State of
New York, the State University College at Geneseo, or the County
of Livingston.
(2) Single-family dwellings occupied by a record title holder.
(3) Transient shelters and group homes subject to state inspection.
(4) Residential structures of which ownership passes to a
governmental unit.
(5) Hotels or motels.
(6) Tourist homes or bed-and-breakfast dwellings.
(7) Nursing homes, intermediate care nursing homes or convalescent
dwellings.
E. Where a nonresidential business or activity or a state-licensed or stateapproved
use occupies a portion of a building and the building contains
premises which would otherwise be subject to this chapter, this chapter
shall be and remain applicable to the residential and common or public
areas of such building and premises.

would tend to allow identification of the property by an owner
thereof.

Pursuant to the authority granted by § 5-530 of the Village Law of the
State of New York, a tax equal to 1% of its gross income on and after

property subject to such supervision under Article 7 of the Transportation

income tax for 12 months ending December 31 in excess of $500, which
taxes shall have application only within the territorial limits of the Village of

other provision of law. Such taxes shall not be imposed on any transaction
originating or consummated outside the territorial limits of the Village of
Geneseo, notwithstanding that some acts are necessarily performed with
respect to such transactions within such limits.
§ 117-6. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
GROSS INCOME — Includes receipts received in or by reason of any sale,

to which it is provided that the profits from the sales shall be included in the
gross income, made or service rendered for ultimate consumption or use by
the purchaser in the Village of Geneseo, New York, including cash, credit
and property of any kind or nature, whether or not such sale is made or such
service is rendered for profit, without any deductions therefrom on account
of costs of the property sold, the cost of the material used, labor or services
or other costs, interest or discount paid or any other expense whatsoever;
also profits from the sale of real property growing out of the ownership
or use of or interest in such property; also profit from sale of personal
property other than property of a kind which would properly be included
in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the period for
which a return is made; also receipts from interest dividends and royalties
derived from sources within the Village of Geneseo, New York, other than
such as are received from a corporation, a majority of whose voting stock
is owned by the taxpaying utility, without any deduction therefrom for any
expenses whatsoever incurred in connection with the receipt thereof; and
also profits from any transaction whatsoever, except sales for resale and
rentals, within the Village of Geneseo, New York; provided, however, that
the words "gross income" shall include, in the case of a utility engaged in
§ 117-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 117-6
1:183
selling telephones or telephone service, only receipts from local exchange
service wholly consummated within the Village of Geneseo, New York.
GROSS OPERATING INCOME — Includes receipts received in or by reason
of any sale, conditional or otherwise, made for ultimate consumption or use
by the purchaser of gas, electricity, steam, water, refrigeration or telephone
service or in or by reason of the furnishing for such consumption or use

Village of Geneseo, New York, including cash, credits and property of any
kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom on account of the property

discount paid or any other expenses whatsoever.
PERSON — Persons, corporations, companies, associations, joint-stock
associations, copartnerships, estates, assignee of rents, any person acting
in a fiduciary capacity or any other entity, and persons, their assignees,
lessees, trustees or receivers, appointed by any court whatsoever or by any
other means, except the state municipalities, political and civil subdivisions
of the state or municipality and public districts.
UTILITY — Includes every person subject to the supervision of the State
Department of Public Service and every other person, whether or not such
person is subject to such supervision, who sells gas, electricity, steam,
water, refrigeration or telephone service delivered through mains, pipes or
wires or furnishes gas, electricity, steam, water, refrigeration or telephone
service by means of mains, pipes or wires, regardless of whether such
activities are the main business of such person or are only incidental thereto
or whether use is made of the public streets.
§ 117-7. Records.
Every utility subject to tax under this article shall keep such records of its
business and in such form as the Village Treasurer may require or as the
Village Board may require, and such records shall be preserved for a period
of three years, except that the Village Treasurer or the Village Board may
consent to their destruction within that period or may require that they be
kept longer.
§ 117-8. Filing of returns. [Amended 7-5-1989 by L.L. No. 4-1989]
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file annually, on or before March
15 of each year, a return for the 12 calendar months or part thereof ending
the prior December 31; provided, however, that, in lieu of an annual return,
any utility may file quarterly on or before the 15th day of July, October,
January and April for the calendar quarter preceding each such return
date. Every return shall state the gross income or gross operating income
for the period covered thereby. Returns shall be filed with the Village
Treasurer on a form to be furnished by him for such purpose and shall
contain such other data, information or matter as he may require to be
included therein. The Village Treasurer, in order to ensure payment of the
tax imposed, may require at any time a further or supplemental return,
§ 117-6 GENESEO CODE § 117-8
1:184
which shall contain any data that may be specified by him. Every return
shall have annexed thereto an affidavit of the head of the utility making the
same, or of the owner or copartner thereof, or of a principal officer of the
corporation, if such business is conducted by a corporation, to the effect
that the statements contained therein are true.
§ 117-9. Payment.
At the time of filing a return, each utility shall pay to the Village of Geneseo
the tax imposed by this article for the period covered by such return. Such
tax shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return or, if a return
is not filed when due, on the last day on which the return is required to be
filed.
§ 117-10. Insufficient returns; determination by Village.
In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Village Treasurer and if a corrected or sufficient return
is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice from him or
if no return is made for any period, the Village Treasurer shall determine
the amount of tax due from such information as he is able to obtain and,
if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of external indices or
otherwise. He shall give notice of such determination to the person liable
for such tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax,
unless the person against whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the
giving of notice of such determination, apply to the Village Treasurer for
a hearing or unless the Village Treasurer, of his own motion, shall reduce
the same. After such hearing, the Village Treasurer shall give notice of his
decision to the person liable for the tax. Such decision may be reviewed
by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of
the State of New York if application therefor is made within 90 days after
the giving of notice of such decision. An order to review such decision
shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed,
with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the
Village Treasurer and an undertaking filed with him, in such amount and
such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect
that, if such proceeding is dismissed or the tax confirmed, the applicant
will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such
proceeding, or, at the option of the applicant, such undertaking may be
in a sum sufficient to cove the tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges
aforesaid, in which event the applicant shall not be required to pay such
tax, interest and penalties as a condition precedent to the granting of such
order. Except in the case of willfully false or fraudulent returns with intent
to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the
expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a return;
provided, however, that, where no returns have been filed as required by
this article, the tax may be assessed at any time.
§ 117-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 117-11
1:185
§ 117-11. Notice.
Any notice authorized or required to be given under the provisions of
this article may be given by mailing the same to the person for whom
it is intended in a postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the
address given by him under this article or, if no return has been filed,
then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined, according to the
provisions of this article, by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 117-12. Penalty for failure to file.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax or
any portion thereof within the time required by this article shall be subject
to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax for each
month's delay or fraction thereof, except the first month after such return
was required to be filed or such tax became due, but the Village Treasurer,
for cause shown, may extend the time for filing any return and, if satisfied
that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the penalty by
the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 117-13. Refunds.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof
shall make application for a refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or
the court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof
was erroneously or illegally collected, the Village Treasurer shall refund
the amount so determined. For a like cause and within the same period, a
refund may be so made on the initiative of the Village Treasurer. However,
no refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination
of the Village Treasurer as hereinbefore provided unless the Village
Treasurer, after a hearing as hereinbefore provided or of his own motion,
shall have reduced the tax penalty or if it shall have been established in a
proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State
of New York that such determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds
shall be made out of moneys collected under this article. An application for
a refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application
for the revision of the tax penalty complained of, and the Village Treasurer
may receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After making his
determination, the Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person
interested, and he shall be entitled to an order to review such determination
under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York
subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained relating to the granting of
such order.
§ 117-11 GENESEO CODE § 117-14
1:186
§ 117-14. Tax to be part of operating costs.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 117-15. Enforcement action.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
article, the Village Attorney shall, upon request of the Village Board, bring
an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any judgment
obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Village Treasurer. Each such
tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person liable to
pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the tax and
penalty imposed by § 186 of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 117-16. Powers and duties of Treasurer.
In the administration of this article, the Treasurer shall have power to make
such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, as may be
necessary for the exercise of his powers and the performance of his duties;
and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other records relating to
the administration and enforcement of the tax; to take testimony and proofs,
under oath, with reference to any matter within the line of his official duty
under this article, and to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses
and the production of books, papers and documents.
§ 117-17. Disposition of moneys.
All taxes and penalties received by the Village Treasurer under this article
shall be paid into the treasury of the Village of Geneseo and shall be
credited to and deposited in the general fund of the Village.

ARTICLE I
Intent, Applicability, and Definitions
§ 130-1. Title.
This chapter shall constitute and be known as "The Zoning Ordinance of the
Village of Geneseo," New York, heretofore known as the "Geneseo Zoning
Ordinance," and may be cited as such.
§ 130-2. Intent; word usage.
§ 130-3. Applicability; severability.
A. The intent of this chapter is to encourage appropriate and orderly
physical development; to promote public health, safety, convenience
and general welfare; to classify, designate and regulate the location and
use of buildings, structures and land for mixed-use, residential,
commercial, industrial or other uses in appropriate places; and, for said
purpose, to divide into districts of such number, shape and area as may
deemed best suited to carry out these regulations and provide for their
enforcement.
B. This chapter is one of the key mechanisms for implementing the
Village's long-term planning goals which will guide development in
Geneseo to provide a balance of developed uses and open space
throughout the Village; to create residential neighborhoods close to but
not negatively impacted by recreation, employment and shopping
opportunities; and to avoid the negative impacts of uncontrolled access
and demands for inefficient expansion of public utilities.
C. These regulations are in accordance with the Village's long-term
planning goals and have been made with reasonable concern for the
character of each district and their suitability for particular uses.
D. For the purposes of this chapter, all terms used in the present tense
include the future tense. All terms in the plural number include the
singular number, and all terms in the singular number include the
plural number, unless the natural construction of the term indicates
otherwise. The term "person" includes a firm, association, organization,
partnership, trust, company or individual. Any gender specific term,
such as "he" or "chairperson," is inclusive of both male and female. The
term "shall" is mandatory and directory. The term "may" is permissive.
The term "used" includes the term "designated, intended or arranged to
be used."
A. Except as herein provided, no building or land in the Village of Geneseo
shall be used or occupied, nor shall any building or part thereof be
erected, moved or altered, unless in conformity with the regulations of
this chapter. Existing buildings, structures and uses which do not
comply with the regulations of this chapter shall be allowed to continue

nonconformities.
B. The provisions of this chapter shall be separable in accordance with the
following rules:
(1) If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge any provision of
this chapter to be invalid, the Village will promptly revise said
provision, and such judgment shall not affect any other property,
building or structure.
(2) If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge any provision of
this chapter to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect any other
provisions of this chapter.
(3) If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the
application of any provision of this chapter to a particular property,
building or structure, such judgment shall not affect the application
of said provision to any other property, building or structure.
A. This chapter shall become effective 30 days from the date of adoption.
B. Any variance or special use permit which was lawfully issued under the
most recent provisions of this chapter shall continue to be valid. Any
variance or special use permit which could not be issued after the
effective date of these regulations shall be allowed to continue subject
to the provisions of Article VIII relating to nonconformities.
C. Any construction or alteration of a building or structure which has not
yet obtained a certificate of occupancy but which has commenced
construction at least 90 days before the effective date in accordance
with a valid building permit shall be allowed to complete construction.
If such building or use is not in conformance with the regulations of this
chapter, it shall be subject to the provisions of Article VIII relating to
nonconformities.
D. This chapter and any amendments thereof shall apply to all applications
pending and not yet finally decided on the date of adoption, except that

C. Variances. When, in its judgment, the public safety, convenience and
welfare will be served, the Zoning Board of Appeals may vary or modify
the application of the regulations or provisions of this chapter relating
to the use, construction or alteration of structures or use of the land. In
such cases, the Zoning Board is empowered to grant exceptions in
harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter. Variances
will be granted in appropriate and specific cases only after public notice
and hearing and subject to such appropriate conditions and safeguards
the Zoning Board of Appeals may impose.
(1) As used in this chapter, variances shall be grouped under two
headings: area and use, where area variances may be authorized
for deviations in height, area, size of structure, size of yards and
open spaces, and use variances may be authorized for
establishment or expansion of an approved use otherwise not
allowed. A use variance shall not be granted solely because of the
presence of nonconformities in the zoning district or uses in an
adjoining zoning district.
(2) Area variances. In making its determination on granting an area
variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take into consideration
the benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted, as weighed
against the detriment to the health, safety and welfare of the
neighborhood or community by such grant. In making such
determination, the Board shall also consider whether:
(a) An undesirable change will be produced in the character of the
neighborhood or a detriment to nearby properties will be
created by the granting of the area variance;
(b) The benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some
method, feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than an area
variance;
(c) The requested area variance is substantial;
(d) The proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on
the physical or environmental conditions in the neighborhood
or district; and
(e) Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Board of
Appeals, but shall not necessarily preclude the granting of the
area variance.
(3) Use variances. A use variance shall not be granted by the Board of
Appeals without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning
regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. In
order to prove such unnecessary hardship, the applicant shall
demonstrate to the Board of Appeals that for each and every
permitted use under the zoning regulations for the particular
district where the property is located:
§ 130-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-17
1:273
(a) The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that
lack of return is substantial, as demonstrated by competent
financial evidence;
(b) That the alleged hardship relating to the property in question
is unique and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood;
(c) That the requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood;
(d) That the alleged hardship has not been self-created; and
(e) That the variance will afford the least intrusive solution.
(4) Variance procedures.
(a) An application for the approval of a variance shall be made, by
an owner of an interest in the lot, to the Code Enforcement
Officer on forms available therefrom, accompanied by the
necessary fees and documents as provided in this chapter and
the regulations issued hereunder.
(b) The application shall be accompanied by a map drawn to an
appropriate scale and showing all existing and proposed
characteristics of the site and adjacent properties necessary
for consideration of the variance request. For applications
where site plan approval is also required, a preliminary site
plan in accordance with Article XIV of this chapter shall be
required.
(c) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of variances, shall grant
the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and
welfare of the community.
(d) The Zoning Board of Appeals shall fix a reasonable time and
place for a public hearing thereon and shall provide for the
giving of notice as follows:
[1] A notice shall be published in the official newspaper of the
Village at least five days prior to the date thereof; the cost
of such publication shall be borne by the appealing party
and shall be paid to the Board prior to the hearing of such
appeal.
[2] The Zoning Board of Appeals shall mail a copy of such
notice to all agencies, municipalities, authorities, etc., as
prescribed in § 7-712-a, Subdivision 10, of the Village Law

[4] The cost of sending or publishing any notices relating to
such appeal, or a reasonable fee relating thereto, shall be
borne by the appealing party and shall be paid to the
Board prior to the hearing of such appeal.
(e) The Board shall approve, with or without conditions, or
disapprove the application within 62 days of the public hearing
as specified in § 7-712-a of General Village Law and shall
communicate its action, in writing, to the applicant, and to the
Code Enforcement Officer within five days of the meeting at
which it decided upon the application. When applicable,
compliance shall be required in accordance with the provisions
of §§ 239-m and 239-n of the General Municipal Law.
(f) The Code Enforcement Officer shall, upon receipt of the notice
of approval and upon application by the applicant, collect all
required fees and issue a building permit or such other
approval permitting the variance, subject to all conditions
imposed by such approval.

to permit variations in the minimum lot size and setback
requirements of this chapter subject to the conditions set forth in
this subsection and according to criteria contained in the
subdivision regulations (Article XIII). The Planning Board is further

community.
(3) Minimum development size. The Planning Board may permit or
require open space development on all lands of four or more acres
zoned for residential purposes and proposed for subdivision.
(4) Density. An open space design shall not result in a permitted

recreational characteristics with access, shape, size and location as
determined by the Planning Board. The permanent preservation of
such open space areas shall be legally assured in accordance with
the provisions of this subsection by the filing of appropriate
covenants, deed restrictions, easements or other agreements in
recordable form acceptable to the Village Attorney to accomplish
the restriction of any and all subsequent residential or other
development. Open space shall be maintained in a manner
consistent with its intended purpose.

A. Intent. The intent of the Waterfront Mixed-Use District (WMU) is to
encourage water-dependent and water-enhanced uses along the
Village's Genesee River waterfront. The creation of this district
promotes the development of the Village's waterfront as a low-intensity
mixed-use area that will serve the Village as well as the surrounding
region. The district should create a zone where residential uses are
combined with other water-enhanced and water-dependent uses in
order to provide an area of distinct character within the Village.
Development in this district shall be considerate of views and uses of
abutting properties and the Genesee River. Therefore, where
development fronting both a primary street and the waterfront is
proposed, these properties will be considered to have two front yards.
Buildings located in this district shall have a clear relationship to the
Genesee River, and, where possible, should locate primary building
facades on both the waterfront and designated Village street frontages,
and, as such, shall promote continuity throughout the district.
B. Permitted uses. Please see the Village of Geneseo Bulk and Use Table,
§ 130-134. Permitted uses are subject to the requirements specified

A. Intent. The intent of the Mixed-Use District - 2 (MU-2) is to encourage
the continuation of small- and medium-scale retail, office, services and
other commercial uses that will serve the Village as well as the
surrounding region and to protect the health, safety and general
welfare of those residing within the district. The district should serve as
a transitional area between the historic core of the Village with the
larger-scale commercial uses found immediately east of the Village.
B. Permitted uses. Please see the Village of Geneseo Bulk and Use Table,
§ 130-135. Permitted uses are subject to the requirements specified

H. Design standards.
(1) Intent of the standards. The following design standards are in
accordance with the vision set forth by the Village Comprehensive
Plan adopted on September 10, 2007, for the district now defined
as Mixed Use – Two (MU-2) on the Official Zoning District Map. The
purpose of these standards is to describe the desired future
development pattern, form, massing, site layout and architectural
detailing for the MU-2 District. As described in the Comprehensive
Plan, this area is currently not reflective of the traditional village
character desired by the community based upon input provided by
residents and landowners throughout the planning process and
recorded in the community survey, public meetings and official
hearings. The Village understands that the current form, site layout
and architectural detailing are the result of past zoning regulations
and planning decisions that do not represent the future vision of
the community. For this reason, the Village views this area as a
transitional location between the historic Village core and the
modern suburban pattern of development east of the Village. Given
its transitional nature, there is a need for clear standards that meet
the goals and objectives of the community while still allowing for
flexibility and creativity. These standards, when utilized with the
MU-2 Bulk and Use Table (§ 130-135), will provide the necessary
regulatory guidance and framework for flexible design alternatives
to accomplish the vision set forth in the Comprehensive Plan.
(2) Design elements.
(a) Site Planning. Site planning standards primarily address the
organization of a project's components. They deal with the
location of buildings and site features such as parking lots,
open space and service areas, as well as the organization of
circulation patterns for vehicles and pedestrians.
(b) Streetscape. The streetscape standards are intended to
improve connectivity and character of the MU-2 District. A
community's streets are its largest and most continuous
§ 130-36 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-36
1:291
system of public spaces, and it is especially important to
acknowledge their significance in the retention or development
of high-quality neighborhoods and districts.
(c) Architectural expression. Architectural standards deal with the
exterior elements of buildings and components that define the
look of a building, such as roofs, windows, articulation and
details. Standards for architectural elements will encourage
new development to define a unique district identity while
allowing for flexibility of expression at the individual building
level. New development or renovations, including those
incorporating contemporary styles, should complement the
historic character and value that has been established in the
Village.
(3) Site planning design standards.
(a) Building orientation and setback.
[1] Building placement shall meet the requirements set forth
in the MU-2 Bulk and Use Table, § 130-135.
[2] Building entry. For buildings fronting on Route 20A, the
primary building entrance shall be on 20A or, at the
discretion of the Planning Board, at the side or rear of the
structure depending on the site layout (see Figure 1).
Buildings fronting on roads other than 20A shall have the
primary entrance located on the primary street.
Regardless of where the entrance is built, the side of the
building facing the primary street will always be
considered the front.
[3] Drive-in facilities.
[a] Whenever possible, drive-in facilities shall be provided
in the rear of the building, unless the Planning Board
determines such an arrangement is not feasible due to
site limitations.
[b] Such drive-in facilities include, but are not limited to,
banking teller windows, automated teller machines,
restaurant order and pickup windows and other
pickup or delivery services deemed inclusive by the
Planning Board.
[4] Loading and service areas. Loading docks, bays and
service areas shall be located to the rear of the structure.
In cases where this is not feasible, a side loading area may
be approved by the Planning Board if appropriate
screening is provided.
[5] Refuse storage, staging and enclosures.
§ 130-36 GENESEO CODE § 130-36
1:292
[a] The storage and/or staging of refuse shall take place
in the rear yard and shall be buffered or screened
from view of parking facilities and adjacent
properties.
[b] Refuse/garbage dumpsters shall be located within an
enclosure designed to screen 100% of the containers
when closed.
[c] The enclosure should be constructed of materials
complementary to that of the principal structure.
[d] Where possible, gate access to the enclosure should
be located out of direct view from parking areas and
principal building entrances, and efforts should be
made to maintain the gates in a closed position other
than times of refuse pickup or delivery.
[6] Stormwater facilities.
[a] Stormwater detention or retention facilities are not
permitted in front yards.
[b] Stormwater facilities shall be integrated into the
overall site design or, where existing, a larger regional
retention and management system, and the use of
basins kept to a minimum towards achieving required
regulatory standards.
[c] The siting, construction and management of these
facilities should be such that they provide a positive
design element in the overall landscape of the project.
[d] The provision of fencing around stormwater facilities
shall not be allowed.
[7] Shared access and parking.
[a] The provision for shared access and parking among
adjacent properties along the Route 20A corridor shall
be required to internalize traffic movements and
reduce turning movements onto Route 20A (see
§ 130-42, Access Management Overlay District).
[b] Where appropriate and feasible, shared entrances and
exits shall be provided.
[c] Where appropriate and feasible, common or shared
parking facilities between two principal businesses
with differing hours of peak operation shall be
required to decrease the amount of impervious
surface and increase the amounts of open space.
§ 130-36 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-36
1:293
[8] Projects with multiple buildings (see Figures 1 and 2).
[a] Projects with multiple buildings shall be sited with
pedestrian connections between structures, parking
areas and adjacent uses.
[b] Multiple structures shall be placed in a fashion that
creates a well-organized, accessible and functional
site. The Village encourages site layouts that create a
unique sense of place and do not result in large
parking lots with no landscaping or pedestrian
accommodations.
[c] Projects with multiple structures are encouraged to
attend a sketch plan meeting with the Village Planning
Board, as described in the site plan review process,

A. Purpose and intent. The purpose of the Open Space Overlay District is
to provide special controls to guide land development adjacent to
significant open space, waterway corridors, wetlands, steep slopes,
scenic views and other sensitive environmental features in the Village
of Geneseo. The district regulations encourage planning and
development of land that will protect and preserve these sensitive
environmental areas. It is also the intent of these regulations to prevent
soil erosion, sedimentation and slope failure due to removal of
vegetation, dredging, filling, damming or channelization; prevent
degradation or loss of scenic views and the natural character of the
area; and prevent activities which degrade water quality.
B. Delineation of district boundaries. The boundaries of the district shall
be delineated by the Village of Geneseo Zoning District Map. If along a
stream corridor, the Overlay District shall include all those areas within
100 feet of waterways measured horizontally from the center line of the
waterway.
C. Regulated activities. No person shall conduct any of the following
regulated activities unless such person has first applied for and
obtained an OSOD development permit pursuant to the requirements of
this section. Customary agricultural operations are not required to
obtain an OSOD development permit.
(1) Construction of new buildings or structures or additions to or
modifications of existing buildings or structures.
(2) Construction or placement of any on-site septic or sewage disposal
system.
(3) Filling, cutting or excavation, either on land or within a
watercourse or floodplain.
(4) Removal of natural vegetation.
(5) Discharge of stormwater and/or construction of a private
commercial or municipal stormwater runoff system.
(6) Outside storage of materials and equipment used in the conduct of
a business.
(7) Activities which would alter the natural flow pattern of any of the
aforementioned watercourses.
(8) Construction of public or private roads, trails and bridges.
(9) Construction of boat launching sites and fishing access parking
areas.
(10) The placement of permanent signs.
D. Development standards and permits. In granting, denying or
conditioning any application for an OSOD development permit, the CEO
§ 130-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-40
1:311
or the Planning Board, whichever is responsible for the permit, shall
consider the effect that the proposed regulated activity shall have on
the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of the open
space and environmentally sensitive features within the Village.
(1) General regulations. Any applicant for a permit to undertake a
regulated activity within an Open Space Overlay District shall be
required to adequately demonstrate that the proposed activity will
in no way at present or at any time in the future adversely affect the
following:
(a) Water quality.
(b) Watercourse flood-carrying capacities.
(c) Rate of sedimentation.
(d) Rate/velocity of groundwater runoff.
(e) Natural characteristics of the watercourse or floodplain.
(f) Scenic views.
(2) Specific standards. No permit to undertake a regulated activity
within the district shall be issued by the CEO or the Planning
Board, whichever is responsible for the permit, unless it
determines that the proposed project complies with the following
standards:
(a) The proposed activity provides adequate measures to prevent
disruption and pollution of fish and wildlife habitats and
freshwater wetlands, stormwater runoff, septic and sewage
systems and any other activity on the site.
(b) A natural vegetative buffer of 100 feet from each bank shall be
retained adjacent to watercourses to absorb floodwaters, to
trap sediments, to protect adjacent fish and wildlife habitats
and to protect scenic qualities.
(c) Site preparation, including stripping of vegetative cover or
grading, shall be undertaken so that the amount of time that
disturbed ground surfaces are exposed to the energy of rainfall
and runoff water is limited. Disturbed soils shall be stabilized
and revegetated immediately after 60 consecutive days
without substantial construction activities. Such activities
include, but are not limited to, demolition, site clearing, topsoil
stripping and stockpiling, utility relocations or removals, and
improvements to buildings or property. Erosion protection
measures, including but not limited to vegetation, retention
ponds, recharge basins, berming, silt traps and mulching, shall
be used to ensure that sedimentation is minimized and
mitigated.
§ 130-40 GENESEO CODE § 130-40
1:312
(d) The project shall provide adequate measures to protect surface
waters and groundwaters from direct or indirect pollution and
from overuse.
(e) Fill shall not encroach on natural watercourses, constructed
channels or floodway areas. All fill shall be compacted at a final
angle or repose which provides stability for the material,
minimizes erosion and prevents settlement.
(f) Roads, trails and walking paths along water bodies shall be
sited and constructed so they are not a source of runoff and
sedimentation. Such roads, trails and walking paths shall be
constructed and sited in such a manner as to maximize the
visual opportunities of a water body while maintaining the
scenic qualities of the water body.
(g) No new dock, boat launching site or fishing access and parking
area shall be constructed unless it is shown that it will not
impede the natural flow of the streams to which this section
applies. Said facilities shall be located and constructed so as to
minimize their intrusion into water bodies and avoid adverse
environmental impact and unreasonable impacts upon public
use of the waters.
(h) New structures, except crossings which are regulated by the
New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
and/or the United States Army Corps of Engineers, shall not be
constructed within 100 feet of the bank of a naturally occurring
watercourse.
(i) New structures shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with erosion control standards and stormwater
control standards contained in the Best Management Practices
for Stormwater Runoff Management and Stormwater
Management Guidelines for New Development, as found in
Chapter 6 of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation's Stream Corridor Management Manual.
(j) Natural vegetation removal. The following activities associated
with the removal of natural vegetation shall be allowed without
obtaining an OSOD development permit; all other clearing
activities within the OSOD shall require application before the
Planning Board for approval prior to commencement of
activities:
[1] Clearing of vegetation within 100 feet of an existing
primary residence.
[2] Maintenance clearing of trees and woody vegetation up to
five years old within six feet of an existing fence line.
§ 130-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-40
1:313
§ 130-41. Planned Residential Development District (PRD).
[3] Clearing to control invasive plants listed by and in
accordance with standards set by the Invasive Plant
Council of New York State.
[4] Clearing of 12 or fewer trees of less than or equal to six
inches in diameter at breast height within one calendar
year.
A. Legislative intent.
(1) The intent of this Planned Residential Development District (PRD)
provision is to encourage a greater degree of flexibility for
development and to provide a variety of residential uses in a
planned, controlled environment and in a manner blending all land
uses into a functionally and aesthetically complementary whole. A
planned residential development proposal may contain both
individual building sites and common property, which are proposed
for development as an integrated land use.
(2) This section recognizes that the standard zoning function (bulk and
use) and the subdivision function (platting and design) are
appropriate for the regulation of land use in areas or
neighborhoods that are already substantially developed. These
controls represent a type of regulation which may be adverse to the
techniques of land development contained in the planned
residential development concept. A rigid set of space requirements
along with bulk and use specifications would frustrate the
application of this concept. Thus, where PRD techniques are
deemed appropriate through the rezoning of land to a Planned
Residential Development District by the Village Board, the use and
dimensional specifications elsewhere in the codes of the Village of
Geneseo are replaced by an approval process in which an approved
PRD plan becomes the basis for continuing land use controls.
B. Definitions. Terms used in this section are defined in Section § 130-5 of
the Village Code.
C. Objectives. To implement the intent of the planned residential
development provision, the following objectives must be met:
(1) A combination of the types of environment, occupancy tenure (e.g.,
cooperatives, condominium, leasing), types of housing and lot sizes
available to persons at varying economic levels.
(2) Provision of usable open space, water quality facilities and
recreation areas.
(3) A development pattern which preserves trees, outstanding natural
topography, man-made historic features and structures, and
geographic features and prevents soil erosion.
§ 130-40 GENESEO CODE § 130-41
1:314
(4) A development pattern which, wherever possible, extends, mimics,
or otherwise complements the existing street grid pattern of the
historic Village core.
(5) A creative use of land and related physical development which
allows an orderly transition of land from existing Village
neighborhoods to adjacent undeveloped Village lands and/or rural
areas in the Town.
(6) An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and
streets.
(7) A development pattern in harmony with the objectives of this
section and the Comprehensive Plan.
(8) A more desirable environment than would be possible through the
strict application of other sections of this chapter.
(9) The architectural design of residential buildings shall be sensitive
to the scale and character of the Village and consist of design
treatments that are attractive and appropriate. Such
considerations may include, but not be limited to, the following:
(a) Facades, roof forms and exterior walls. Facades, gabled
rooflines and exterior walls should have three-dimensional
variations to provide interest and variety. In large residential
buildings, suggested techniques include organizing large
building masses (not to exceed 100 feet in length) into a series
of smaller masses, providing offsets in exterior walls; providing
an accent form or forms; and providing a variation in rooflines
or heights that are compatible with the design theme. The
areas and patterns of glazing used in facades should be
compatible with the three-dimensional design of the building.
(b) Exterior walls above grade that are attached to buildings
should appear to be integral to the building, i.e., walls attached
to brick building surfaces should be reddish-colored brick in
keeping with the historic character of the community. Other
above-grade screening walls, such as dumpster enclosures or
transformer screen walls, should match materials and colors
used in the building facades.
(c) Building entrances. Building entrances should be in scale with
the building facade and have weather cover.
(d) Color and material of primary building components. The use of
earthtone colors and/or natural siding as primary facade
materials is preferred. The use of reflective glass, split-face
concrete masonry units or metal or vinyl siding is discouraged.
Brightly colored accent bands located on building facades that
are primarily attention-getting shall be avoided.
§ 130-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-41
1:315
(e) Exterior lighting. Dark Sky compliant lighting fixtures are
required. In addition, all electrical distribution lines shall be
installed underground in keeping with the Village of Geneseo's
Design Standards.
D. General requirements.
(1) Minimum area. The minimum area required to qualify for a Planned
Residential Development District (PRD) shall be 10 contiguous
acres of land. Where the applicant can demonstrate that the
characteristics of his or her holdings will meet the objectives of this
section, the Village Board may approve PRD projects with less
acreage.
(2) Ownership. The tract of land for a PRD may be owned, leased or
controlled either by a single person or corporation or by a group of
individuals or corporations. An application must be filed by the
owner, or jointly by owners, of all property included in a project. In
the case of multiple ownership, the approved PRD plan is binding
on all owners.
(3) Location of the Planned Residential Development District. The PRD
shall be applicable to any residential district or parts of districts
where the applicant can demonstrate that the characteristics of his
or her holdings and plan will meet the objectives of this section.
(4) Common open space. Common open space in a PRD may be one or
more sites for use in common by all of the occupants within the
project area or by the residents of the Village as a whole,
depending upon dedication of such sites. In all cases, such open
space devoted to recreation, common parkland, or stormwater
management areas as delineated and designated by the petitioners
as common open space shall not be less than 25% of the gross area
of a proposed planned residential development. This area shall
exclude all sidewalks, streets, roads, required yards and required
parking spaces. Such common open space may be retained in
private ownership or received in dedication by the Village. If the
open space remains in private ownership, arrangements for the
operation, maintenance, improvement and liability of such common
property and facilities must be approved by the Village Board. No
common open space, so designated by the proposal and approved
by the Village Board, may be thereafter developed or disposed of
except with the approval of the Village Board.
E. Permissible uses. This subsection sets forth the uses which may be
approved for a planned residential development. Such uses include and
shall be limited to the following:
(1) Single-family detached dwellings, excluding social clubs, sororities
and fraternities, whether recognized or unrecognized.
§ 130-41 GENESEO CODE § 130-41
1:316
(2) Attached or row dwellings (also known as "townhouses"), excluding
social clubs, sororities and fraternities whether recognized or
unrecognized.
(3) Apartment buildings, excluding social clubs, sororities and
fraternities, whether recognized or unrecognized.
(4) Common, public or private open space, park or recreation areas,
including playgrounds, woodland, conservation areas, walkways,
trails, stream-crossing and drainage control areas and other similar
recreational uses but which may not include any such uses or
activities which produce unreasonable noise, glare, odor, air
pollution, fire hazards or other safety hazards, smoke or fumes, or
other things detrimental to existing or prospective development of
the neighborhood, as set forth by the standards in § 130-67.
(5) Municipal, church or philanthropic uses.
(6) Model home exhibits, temporary sales and construction offices and
uses accessory thereto, solely in conjunction with the planned
residential development that shall be subject to renewals, at the
discretion of the Planning Board, which shall not exceed time
periods of six months after the first time period established by the
Planning Board.
(7) Accessory use on the same lot with, and customarily incidental to,
any of the foregoing uses.
(a) Off-street parking facilities.
(b) Swimming pools.
(c) Garages.
(d) Storage facilities for landscape and building maintenance
equipment.
F. Area density and design standards.
(1) Density.
(a) Because land is used more efficiently in a PRD, improved
environmental quality can often be produced with a greater
number of dwelling units per gross building area than usually
permitted in traditionally zoned districts. The determination of
land use intensity ratings or dwelling residential densities shall
be completely documented, including all facts, opinions and
judgments justifying the selection of the rating or density.
(b) The overall residential density of the land within the planned
residential development shall not exceed six dwelling units per
acre.
§ 130-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-41
1:317
(c) Areas designated for attached or row dwellings shall be
developed at a density not to exceed 10 dwelling units per
acre.
(d) Areas designated for apartment buildings shall be developed at
a density not to exceed 12 dwelling units per acre.
(e) The mix of residential units among single-family detached
dwellings, attached or row dwellings, and apartment buildings
shall be determined by the Village Planning Board for each
planned residential development, but no single type of
residential use shall comprise more than 65% of the total
residential units.
(2) Additional requirements that apply to attached or row dwellings:
(a) There shall be no continuous group of attached or row
dwellings consisting of more than seven dwelling units, with
each group of attached or row dwellings having a four-foot
offset for every 50 lineal feet of building.
(b) The minimum width of any side yard abutting a street,
driveway or parking area within the attached or row dwelling
area shall not be less than 20 feet.
(3) Additional requirements that apply to apartment buildings. No
apartment building shall be closer than 60 feet from any boundary
line of the designated apartment building area of which the
apartment building is a part.
G. Off-street parking requirements; road construction.
(1) Adequate parking areas shall be provided for attached or row
dwellings and apartments within the areas designated for same,
and there shall be at least two parking spaces per residential
dwelling unit, in addition to the driveways, roadways, turning and
access areas within the designated housing area.
(2) Garages. Where there are garages proposed which face the front of
the lot, then the front setback for a garage shall be a minimum of
15 feet. Where there are garages proposed which face the side or
rear of the lot, then the side or rear setback for a garage shall be a
minimum of 15 feet. A front-facing garage shall not consist of more
than 40% of the total building frontage. The front facade of the
garage shall not be more than eight feet closer to the street than
the main building facade with the front door.
(3) The construction of adequate sidewalks is required along both
sides of the streets throughout the project and connecting to the
Village's sidewalk system. These criteria may be waived by the
Planning Board upon a finding that site conditions do not warrant
the placement of sidewalks on both sides. In addition, the
§ 130-41 GENESEO CODE § 130-41
1:318
construction of roads and parking areas within the development,
whether or not dedication of them to the Village is contemplated,
shall conform to the Village of Geneseo Land Development
Regulations and Public Works Requirements.
H. Location of structures. The proposed location and arrangement of
structures shall be designed so as to mitigate, to the extent practical,
any significant or adverse impact upon the existing or prospective
development of the neighborhood.
I. Open space and recreation areas.
(1) All recreation areas designated on the development plan shall be
improved and equipped initially by the developer in accordance
with plans approved by the Village Planning Board and shall be
protected by adequate covenants running with the land or by
covenants or dedications of same to the Village.
(2) Open space and recreation areas shall be designated to benefit the
residents of the planned residential development, and to this end
the developer shall have as many dwelling units (all types) as is
feasible abut or be near an open space area.
J. Approval required. Whenever any planned residential development is

agencies, including the Natural Resources Conservation Service
and the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation. The Planning Board may require the exterior design
of all structures be made by, or under the direction of, a registered
architect whose seal shall be affixed to the plans. The Planning
Board may also require such additional provisions and conditions
that appear necessary for the public health, safety and general
welfare.
(5) Action on preliminary site plan and subdivision plat application.
(a) Within 62 days of the receipt of the complete application for
preliminary site plan approval, the Planning Board shall

24.Editor's Note: For environmental quality review, see Article 8 of the Environmental
Conservation Law.
§ 130-41 GENESEO CODE § 130-41
1:324
(b) The Planning Board shall consider a preliminary subdivision
plat complete when a negative declaration has been filed or a
notice of completion of the draft environmental impact
statement has been filed in accordance with the provisions of
SEQRA. The time within which the Planning Board shall hold a
public hearing on the preliminary plat shall be coordinated
with any hearings the Board may schedule pursuant to the
SEQRA regulations. The time period within which the Planning
Board, as the designated lead agency under SEQRA, shall hold
a public hearing is set forth in § 7-728, Subdivision 5(d)(i), of
New York Village Law (Village Law). The time period within
which the Planning Board shall approve, with or without
modification, or disapprove such preliminary plat is set forth in
§ 7-728, Subdivision 5(d)(iii), of Village Law. The time period
within which the Planning Board, with the agreement of a lead
agency, shall hold a joint public hearing with the lead agency's
hearing on the draft environmental impact statement is set
forth in § 7-728, Subdivision 5(e)(i), of the Village Law. The
provisions, including time frames, for publishing the public
hearing notice, length and decision, are set forth in § 7-728,
Subdivision 5(e)(ii), (iii) and (iv).
(c) The Planning Board's statement may include conditions that
certain revisions be incorporated in the final site plan and
subdivision plat. Such conditions shall be limited, however, to
siting and dimensional details within general use areas and
shall not significantly alter the PRD plan as it was approved in
the zoning proceedings.
(d) If the preliminary site plan and subdivision plat is disapproved,
the Planning Board's statement shall contain the reasons for
such findings. In such a case, the Planning Board may
recommend further study of the site plan/subdivision plat and
resubmission of the preliminary site plan/subdivision plat to
the Planning Board after it has been revised or redesigned.
(e) No modification of existing stream channels, filling of lands
with a moderate to high susceptibility to flooding, grading or
removal of vegetation in areas with moderate to high
susceptibility to erosion, or excavation for and construction of
site improvements shall begin until the developer has received
preliminary site plan approval. Failure to comply shall be
construed as a violation of the Village Zoning Law, and where
necessary, final site plan/subdivision plat approval may require
the modification or removal of site improvements.
(6) Request for changes in PRD zoning plan. If in the site plan
development it becomes apparent that certain elements of the PRD
plan, as it has been approved by the Village Board, are unfeasible
and in need of significant modification, the applicant shall then
present his or her solution to the Planning Board as his or her
§ 130-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-41
1:325
preliminary site plan in accordance with the above procedures. The
Planning Board shall then determine whether or not the modified
plan is still in keeping with the intent of the zoning resolution. If
a negative decision is reached, the site plan shall be considered
as disapproved. The developer may then, if he wishes, produce
another site plan in conformance with the approved PRD plan. If an
affirmative decision is reached, the Planning Board shall also notify
the Village Board stating all of the particulars of the matter and
its reasons for feeling the project should be continued as modified.
Preliminary site plan approval may then be given only with the
consent of the Village Board.
(7) Application for final detailed site plan/subdivision plat approval.
(a) After receiving conditional approval from the Planning Board
on a preliminary site plan and approval for all necessary
permits and curb cuts from state and county officials, the
applicant may prepare his or her final detailed site plan and
submit it to the Planning Board for final approval; except that if
more than 12 months has elapsed between the time of the
Planning Board's report on the preliminary site plan and if the
Planning Board finds that conditions have changed
significantly in the interim, the Planning Board may require a
resubmission of the preliminary site plan for further review
and possible revision prior to accepting the proposed final site
plan for review.
(b) The final detailed site plan shall conform substantially to the
preliminary site plan that has received preliminary site plan
approval. It should incorporate any revisions or other features
that may have been required at the preliminary review. All
such compliance shall be clearly indicated by the applicant on
the appropriate submission.
(8) Final site plan/subdivision plat contents. In addition to the
requirements for preliminary site plan/subdivision plat approval, an
application for final site plan/subdivision plat approval shall also
contain:
(a) The final site plan/subdivision plat drawn at a scale of not less
than 50 feet to one inch. Where more than one sheet is
required to show the entire development, a key map shall be
provided.
(b) The lines of existing and proposed streets and sidewalks
immediately adjoining and within the PRD.
(c) The names of existing and proposed streets.
(d) Typical cross sections of proposed streets and sidewalks.
§ 130-41 GENESEO CODE § 130-41
1:326
(e) Profiles of proposed streets at suitable vertical scale showing
finished grades in relation to existing ground elevation.
(f) Layouts of proposed lots, including lot numbers and proposed
numbering system for buildings.
(g) The location and size of any existing and proposed sewers
(stormwater and/or sanitary), water mains, and pipes on the
property or into which any connection is proposed.
(h) Provisions for water supply and sewage disposal, and evidence
that such provisions have received approval of the Department
of Health.
(i) Locations of survey monuments.
(j) A planting plan indicating locations, varieties, and minimum
sizes of trees to be planted and of existing trees to be
preserved. Existing wooded areas need not be itemized but
should be generally described.
(k) Brief specifications, or reference to Village standards, for all
public facilities to be constructed or installed within the PRD.
(9) Action on the final detailed site plan/subdivision plat application.
Within the time frames set forth in § 7-725-a. of Village Law for
final site plan approval and § 7-728, Subdivision 6, of Village Law
for final subdivision plat approval, the Planning Board shall take
action upon these matters.
(10) Staging. If the applicant wishes to stage or phase the PRD
development, then he or she may submit only those stages he or
she wishes to develop for site plan approval in accordance with his
or her staging plan. Any plan which requires more than 24 months
to be completed shall be required to be staged; and a staging plan
must be developed. It is the intent of this section that individual
stages of the PRD will have integrity of use in their own right. If, for
any reason, the entire PRD would not be completed, then those
portions of the PRD already constructed will be an asset to the
community by themselves. To ensure this, all public utilities shall
comply with the adopted Land Development Regulations and Public
Works Requirements for the Village of Geneseo. Staging plans must
take account of this objective, and developers proposing individual
stages that deviate significantly from the overall character of the
PRD should present convincing evidence that such a stage is in
keeping with this section.
P. Other regulations applicable to planned residential developments.
(1) Regulation after initial construction and occupancy. For the
purposes of regulating development and use of property after
initial construction and occupancy, any changes, other than use
§ 130-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-41
1:327
§ 130-42. Access Management Overlay District (AM).
changes, shall be processed as an area variance to the Village
Zoning Board of Appeals. Use changes shall be processed in the
form of a request for Village Board approval. Properties lying
within Planned Residential Development Districts are unique and
shall be so considered by the Planning Board or the Village Board
when evaluating these requests; and maintenance of the intent and
function of the planned residential development shall be of primary
importance.
(2) Site plan review. Site plan review under the provisions of this
section shall suffice for Planning Board review of subdivisions
under the Village Subdivision Regulations, subject to the following
conditions:
(a) The developer shall prepare sets of subdivision plats suitable
for filing with the Office of the Livingston County Clerk in
addition to those drawings required above.
(b) The developer shall plat the entire development as a
subdivision; however, PRDs being developed in stages may be
platted and filed in the same stages.
(c) Final site plan approval under § 130-100B shall constitute final
plat approval under the Village Subdivision Regulations and
provisions of § 7-728 of the Village Law.
Q. Financial responsibility. No building permits shall be issued for
construction within a PRD District until improvements are installed or a
performance bond or letter of credit posted in accordance with the
same procedures as provided for in § 7-730 of the Village Law relating
to subdivisions. Other such requirements may also be established from
time to time by the Village Board.
R. Penalties for offenses. Any person committing an offense against any
provision of this section shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a
fine not to exceed $250 or to imprisonment for a term not to exceed 15
days, or both, for each offense. The continuation of an offense against
the provisions of this section shall constitute, for each day the offense is
continued, a separate and distinct offense hereunder.
A. Intent. The intent of this section is to provide for the future growth and
development of the Village and for the purpose of affording adequate
facilities for the housing, transportation, distribution, comfort, safety,
health and welfare of the population of the Village. Specifically, this
section provides requirements and procedures to:
(1) Provide and manage access to properties while preserving the
operating efficiency of the roadway system.
(2) Improve the safety of motorists and nonmotorists.
§ 130-41 GENESEO CODE § 130-42
1:328
(3) Reduce traffic congestion and delay associated with poor access
location and design.
(4) Coordinate access management with the New York State
Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) and Livingston County.
B. Applicability.
(1) No subdivision of any lot, tract or parcel of land shall be effected
and no street, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water main or other
facilities in connection therewith shall be laid out, constructed,
opened or dedicated for public use and travel or for the common
use of occupants of buildings abutting thereon except in strict
accordance with the provisions of this section.
(2) All plans for subdivisions shall be submitted to the Planning Board
and approved by it before they shall be recorded.
(3) The provisions contained herein shall apply to the following lands
within the Village: [Amended 10-15-2012 by L.L. No. 2-2012]
(a) The MU-2 District.
(b) The CI-1 District.
(c) The portion of the R-3 District located east of NYS Route 39
and north of NYS Route 20A.
(d) The portion of the C-1 District located west of NYS Route 63.
(e) The portion of the R-1 District located west of NYS Route 63,
and the portion of the R-1 District located south of NYS Route
20A and west of Crossett Road.
C. Classification system and standards. The following classifications and
considerations will be used by the Village to classify roads and their
respective design criteria:
(1) Arterial. Arterials generally carry large traffic volumes within and
through urbanized, or developed, areas. They vary from multilane,
divided, controlled access facilities to two-lane streets. They serve
major areas of activity, carrying a high proportion of an area's
traffic on a small proportion of the area's lane mileage. In the
Village of Geneseo, the following streets/roads are considered
arterials:
(a) US Route 20A.
(2) Collector. Collector streets link neighborhoods or areas of
homogeneous land use with arterial streets. They serve the dual
function of land access and traffic circulation. In the Village of
Geneseo, the following streets/roads are considered collectors:
(a) Main Street.
§ 130-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-42
1:329
(b) Avon Road.
(c) NYS Route 63.
(d) NYS Route 63 Bypass (Mary Jemison Drive).
(3) Local. Local streets are primarily Village streets. Their primary
purpose is access to abutting property. In the Village of Geneseo,
all public streets and roads not classified as arterials or collectors
are considered local.
(4) Private (not analyzing). Each of these roads has basic
characteristics, which may be varied to be consistent with unique
proposals of development and construction. The individual
variations of the conditions will not be permitted if they sacrifice
design safety or maintenance of a proposed road type.
D. Access connections and driveway design.
(1) Connection spacing. The following standards and considerations
apply to access points, or driveways, for private development
adjacent to roadways. Design standards for connection spacing of
public roadway intersections are subject to the provisions of
§ 130-97B(9).
(a) Connections under the jurisdiction of the New York State
Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) shall, at a minimum,
meet the standards that are outlined in the NYSDOT Policy and
Standards for Entrances to State Highways, latest edition,
unless waived by the NYSDOT.
(b) Separation between access connections on the same side of a
local, collector, or arterial roadway within Geneseo shall meet
the minimum connection requirements set forth in Table 1
below.

(c) Connection spacing shall be measured from the closest edge of
the pavement of one connection to the closest edge of the
pavement of the next connection. (see Figure 10)
§ 130-42 GENESEO CODE § 130-42
1:330
Figure 10
Corner Clearance and Connection Spacing
(d) The minimum lot frontage for all newly created lots on public
arterial, collector, and local roadways shall not be less than the
applicable minimum connection spacing standards of this
section, as defined in Table 1, unless the property is served by
an internal road system.
(e) Existing individual or assembled lots with less than the
required frontage may be permitted individual access where
the Planning Board determines joint or cross access is
infeasible.
(f) Adjacent properties under the same ownership shall be
considered as a single property for application of connection
spacing or for connection permits.
(g) Applications for multiple connections for a single development
shall conform to the spacing standards of this section, as
defined in Table 1. Multiple connections shall be considered by
the roadway authority and the Planning Board for approval
based on the following criteria:
[1] Separation of standard vehicles from heavy trucks or
emergency vehicles.
[2] Two one-way connections that in combination serve
ingress and egress to the development.
[3] Multiple connections enhance the safety of the abutting
roadway and improve the on-site traffic circulation.
(h) To reduce turning movement conflicts, access connections on
undivided arterial, collector, and local roadways should be
aligned with those connections across the roadway. If such
alignment is not possible, connections on opposite sides of the
undivided roadway shall be designed to meet the standards
shown in Table 2 to ensure safety in traffic and turning
movements.

(i) Access connections on opposite sides of the street not
separated by a restrictive median shall be aligned or offset so
as to eliminate left-turn overlap conflicts between vehicles
traveling in opposite directions.
(j) For properties unable to meet the minimum driveway spacing
standards and corner clearance standards, a temporary
nonconforming driveway may be granted by the Planning
Board. The granting of a temporary driveway by the Planning
Board shall be conditioned on obtaining a shared driveway,
cross-access driveway, or unified parking and circulation with
an abutting lot, and closure of the temporary driveway in the
future.
(2) Connections at intersections.
(a) New connections shall not be permitted within the functional
area of an intersection, as illustrated in Figure 11, unless:
[1] No other reasonable access to the property is available;
and
[2] The connection does not create a potential safety or
operational problem as determined by the roadway
authority and the Planning Board; and
[3] A condition is included in the permit that the applicant
shall agree to close the access if and when alternative
access becomes available that is more consistent with the
corner clearance standards for the abutting roadways.
§ 130-42 GENESEO CODE § 130-42
1:332
Figure 11
Functional and Physical Area of the Intersection
(b) Where no other alternatives exist, construction of an access
connection may be allowed along the property line farthest
from the functional area of the roadway intersection as a
nonconforming access. Property access may be restricted to
the roadway with the lower functional classification and shall
be closed within six months of when any conforming access
becomes available.
(3) Connection to lower-classification roadway.
(a) Where property is served by roads of different functional
classifications, the roadway authority and the Planning Board
may require development to provide primary access on the
road with the lower functional classification in order to
minimize access and traffic congestion on the primary
roadway.
(b) Access to through lots shall be required on the street with the
lower functional classification as shown in Figure 12. Access
onto the higher functional classification roadway may be
approved by the roadway authority and the Planning Board.

Double Frontage Lot Access
(4) Unified access. In the interest of promoting unified access and
circulation systems, development sites under the same ownership
or consolidated for the purposes of development and comprised of
more than one building site shall be considered unified parcels for
purposes of this section. This shall also apply to phased
development plans and master developments that contain a mix of
land uses. Accordingly, the following requirements shall apply:
(a) The number of connections permitted shall be the minimum
number necessary to provide reasonable access to the overall
site and not the maximum available for that frontage.
(b) All easements and agreements required under Cross access
and shared/joint access shall be provided.25
(c) Access to outparcels shall be internalized using the shared

(5) Cross access and shared/joint access.
(a) If the connection spacing standards as defined in Table 1
cannot be achieved, then joint-use connections and/or crossaccess
easements shall be required.
(b) Property owners that provide for joint and cross access may be
granted a temporary connection permit, where necessary, to
provide reasonable access until such time as the joint-use
connection and cross-access connections are provided with
adjacent properties.
(c) Within six months after construction of a joint-use or crossaccess
connection, property owners utilizing such access shall
close and remove any existing temporary connections provided
for access in the interim.
(d) Within six months after construction of a joint-use or crossaccess
connection, property owners utilizing such access shall
close and remove any unnecessary entrances or exits to the
roadway.
(e) Applicants for all nonresidential developments and
redevelopments may be required by the Planning Board to use
cross-access easements and joint-use connections to connect
adjacent properties in order to reduce curb cuts, to increase
the area for parking and landscaping, and to preserve the
capacity and safety of the roadway system.
(f) Property owners utilizing joint and/or cross access shall
record:
[1] An easement allowing cross access to and from the
adjacent properties.

travel for automobiles and emergency service and
loading vehicles. Wider driveways may be required to
serve traffic to major developments or large vehicles.
[2] Shared driveways, cross-access drives, interconnected
parking, and private streets constructed to provide access
to lots internal to a subdivision shall be recorded as an
easement and shall constitute a covenant running with the
land. Operating and maintenance agreements for these
facilities shall be recorded with the deed
(i) Cross-access easements are not intended to be publicly
maintained. The Planning Board may, however, hold such an
easement pending the issuance of such similar easements from
the adjoining property owner(s), with the right to transfer such
easement to the other affected property owner(s) upon such
execution.

(2) Parcels that abut service roads must provide a primary connection
to the service road. Secondary driveways to the public road system
shall be prohibited. In instances where a connection cannot be
made to a service road (for example, the planned service road has
not yet been constructed to the subject property), a temporary
connection to the public road system may be granted by the proper
permitting authority (Village, town, county, or state). This
temporary connection must be removed within six months from the
time that a service road is constructed to or adjacent to the subject
property.
(3) Service roads shall not access any roadway within the functional
area of an existing intersection and shall not create a new access
point that violates the connection spacing criteria as defined in
Table 1 herein.
(4) All service roads, required to be constructed as part of subdivision

and match existing surrounding sidewalks. At the Planning
Board's discretion, inclusion of sidewalks on one side of the
street may be waived for reasons of topography or other
demonstrable physical constraint.
(c) Subdivisions should provide bicycle and pedestrian
connectivity through bicycle and pedestrian facilities that are
both integrated into roadway design and provided as
standalone facilities.
(d) Subdivisions require an internal circulation plan for traffic, as
defined in the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law, § 152.
(e) Subdivision plans should demonstrate connectivity between
developments for pedestrians and bicyclists in order to
minimize short-distance trips by motor vehicles. These can be
provided as "cut-through" easements in suburban cul-de-sac
developments and as part of connected street grids in
traditional neighborhood development.
§ 130-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-42
1:337
(f) Conservation or cluster development (see § 130-31H) can also
be a tool for encouraging access to open space and compact
land use patterns that support increased walking and
bicycling.
(g) Minimum width of all walks shall be five feet with a five-foot
planting strip (or ten-foot-wide sidewalks in the MU-1 District)
unless prohibited by documented environmental constraints.
Sidewalks must be constructed continuously across all
driveways.
(h) All crosswalk, signal, and curb ramp features shall comply with
the minimum guidelines established in the NYSDOT Highway
Design Manual and the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices (MUTCD). Traffic-calming features shall be provided
where necessary to balance pedestrian safety with vehicular
speeds and volumes.

Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines.
(j) Each owner or occupant of any house or other building, and
any owner or person entitled to possession of any vacant lot,
and any person having charge of any facility or public building,
shall be responsible for maintaining the pedestrian facilities
adjacent to their property. During the winter season, this shall
include keeping the sidewalk free of snow and/or ice and at all
other times shall keep the sidewalk in good and safe repair in a
clean condition, free from obstructions or encumbrances.
(2) Bicycle facilities.
(a) Bicycle parking shall be provided in accordance with the
following guidelines. All projects submitted for site plan
approval shall identify bicycle racks and/or lockers in
accordance with these guidelines.
(b) Except in instances where adequate bicycle parking is
available within the right-of-way (such as lamp posts or single
bicycle racks installed on the sidewalk), adequate space shall
be provided on site to accommodate the installation of a
bicycle rack. The Planning Board shall ensure that such space
is within a reasonable distance from the front of the building.
The Planning Board will determine if bicycle parking will be
required.
(c) Bicycle parking schedule. If bicycle parking is required by the
Planning Board, the following minimum amounts of spaces
shall be provided:

A. Applicability.
(1) Planning Board action. All uses subject to the requirements of this
section may be established and maintained if their operation is
approved by the Planning Board as being in conformance with the
standards and regulations limiting dangerous and objectionable
elements, such as dust, smoke, odor, fumes, noise or vibration. In
approving the site plan, the Planning Board shall decide whether
the proposed use will conform to these applicable performance
standards or any additional performance standards required by
§ 130-66 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-67
1:351
state or federal laws or which are generally recognized
performance standards for a given industry.
(2) Use subject to the performance standards procedures.
(a) All uses subject to site plan review must comply with these
performance standards.
(b) In addition, if the Code Enforcement Officer has reasonable
grounds to believe that any other existing or proposed use
violates any of the performance standards, such proposed use
may be required to certify compliance with these performance
standards or such existing use may be cited for violation of
these regulations.
B. Performance standards procedures.
(1) The Code Enforcement Officer as part of the sketch plan
conference shall tentatively identify whether a proposed use will be
required to certify compliance with any of the performance
standards listed in this section. Certification may require signing a
written statement or presentation of construction detail and a
description of the specifications for the mechanisms and
techniques to be used in restricting the emissions of any dangerous
and objectionable elements. The applicant shall also file with such
plans and specifications an affidavit acknowledging understanding
and stating agreement to conform to the same at all times. Any
information which is designated by the applicant as a trade secret
and submitted herewith will be treated as confidential under
provisions of the New York State Freedom of Information Law.
During the course of site plan review, the Planning Board will
determine if the applicant's proposal falls within the performance
standards based upon information provided by the applicant. The
Code Enforcement Officer can require the applicant to show that
the construction detail and a description of the specifications for
the mechanisms and techniques are in compliance with the
standards set forth below.
(2) Vibration.
(a) No vibration shall be produced which is transmitted through
the ground and is discernible without the aid of instruments at
or beyond the lot lines, nor shall any vibrations produced
exceed 0.002 g peak at up to a frequency of 50 cycles per
second, measured at or beyond the lot lines using either
seismic or electronic vibration measuring equipment.
(b) Vibrations occurring at higher than a frequency of 50 cycles
per second or a periodic vibration shall not induce
accelerations exceeding 0.001 g. Single-impulse periodic
vibrations occurring at an average interval greater than five
minutes shall not induce accelerations exceeding 0.01 g.
§ 130-67 GENESEO CODE § 130-67
1:352
(3) Noise.
(a) The maximum decibel level radiated by any use or facility at
any lot lines shall not exceed the values in the designated
octave bands given in Table 3. The sound-pressure level shall
be measured with a second-level meter and associated octaveband
analyzer conforming to standards prescribed by the
American Standards Association. (American Standard Sound-
Level Meters for Measurement of Noise and Other Sound,
Z24.3-1944, American Standards Association, Inc., New York,
New York, and American Standard Specifications for an
Octave-Bank Filter Set for the Analysis of Noise and Other
Sound, Z24.10-1953, American Standards Association, Inc.,

4,800 to 10,000 35
(b) Where any use adjoins a residential or mixed-use district at any
point at the district boundary, the maximum permitted decibel
levels in all octave bands shall be reduced by six decibels from
the maximum levels set forth in Table 3.
(4) Smoke. The density emission of smoke or any other discharge into
the atmosphere during normal operations shall not exceed visible
gray smoke of a shade equal to or darker than No. 2 on the
standard Ringelmann Chart. (A Ringelmann Chart is a chart
published by the United States Bureau of Mines which shows
graduated shades of gray for use in estimating the light-obscuring
capacity of smoke.) These provisions applicable to visible gray
smoke shall also apply to visible smoke of a different color but with
an apparent equivalent capacity.
(5) Odor. No emission shall be permitted of odorous gases or other
odorous matter in such quantities as to be readily detectable when
diluted in the ratio of one volume of odorous air emitted to four
volumes of clean air. Any process which may involve the creation or
§ 130-67 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-67
1:353
emission of any odors shall be provided with a secondary safeguard
system so that control will be maintained if the primary safeguard
system should fail. There is hereby established, as a guide in
determining such quantities of offensive odors, in Table III, Odor
Thresholds, in Chapter 5 of the Air Pollution Abatement Manual,
Copyright 1959, by the Manufacturing Chemical Association, Inc.,
Washington, D.C., as said manual and/or table is subsequently
amended.
(6) Fly ash, dust, fumes, vapors, gases and other forms of air pollution.
No emission shall be permitted which can cause any damage to
health, animals, vegetation or other forms of property or which can
cause any excessive soiling at any point beyond the boundaries of
the lot. The concentration of such emission on or beyond any lot
line shall not exceed 0.1 the maximum allowable concentration set
forth in § 12-29 of the Board of Standards and Appeals of the New
York State Department of Labor, effective October 1, 1956, and any
subsequent standards.
(7) Electromagnetic radiation. It shall be unlawful to operate or cause
to be operated any planned or intentional source of
electromagnetic radiation which does not comply with the current
regulations of the Federal Communications Commission regarding
such sources or electromagnetic radiation, except that, for all
governmental regulations regarding such sources of
electromagnetic radiation of the Interdepartment Radio Advisory
Committee shall take precedence over the regulations of the
Federal Communications Commission. Further, said operation in
compliance with the federal regulations shall be unlawful if such
radiation causes an abnormal degradation in performances of other
electromagnetic radiators or electromagnetic receptors of quality
and proper design because of proximity, primary field, blanketing,
spurious reradiation, harmonic content or modulation of energy
conducted by power or telephone lines. The determination of
abnormal degradation in performance and of quality and proper
design shall be made in accordance with good engineering
practices, as defined in the latest principles and standards of the
American Institute of Radio Engineers and the Electronic
Industries Association. In case of any conflict between the latest
standards and principles of the above groups, the following
precedence in interpretation of the standards and principles shall
apply: American Institute of Electrical Engineers; Institute of Radio
Engineers; and Electronic Industries Association.
(8) Radioactive radiation. No activities shall be permitted which emit
dangerous radioactivity at any point beyond the property lines. The
handling of such radioactive materials, the discharge of such
materials into the air and water and the disposal of radioactive
wastes shall be in conformance with the regulations of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, as set forth in Title 10, Chapter 1, Part 20,
§ 130-67 GENESEO CODE § 130-67
1:354
as amended, and all applicable regulations of the State of New
York.
(9) Heat. Heat emitted at any or all points shall not at any time cause a
temperature increase on any adjacent property in excess of 5° F.,
whether such change is in the air or on the ground, in a natural
stream or lake or in any structure on such adjacent property.
(10) Glare. Dark Sky compliant lighting fixtures are required, as defined
by the following standards:
(a) Direct glare. No such direct glare shall be permitted, with the
exception that parking areas and walkways may be illuminated
by luminaries so hooded or shielded that the maximum angle of
the cone of direct illumination shall be 60° drawn
perpendicular to the ground, and with the exception that such
angle may be increased to 90° if the luminary is less than four
feet above the ground.
(b) Indirect glare. Indirect glare shall not exceed that value which
is produced by an illumination of the reflecting surface, not to
exceed 0.3 footcandle (maximum) and 0.1 footcandle
(average). Deliberately induced sky-reflected glare, as by
casting a beam upward for advertising purposes, is specifically
prohibited.
(11) Liquid or solid waste. No discharge shall be permitted at any point
into a public sewer or stream or into the ground, except in accord
with standards approved by the New York State and Livingston
County Departments of Health and local ordinances, of any
materials of such nature or temperature as can contaminate any
water supply or otherwise cause the emission of dangerous or
offensive elements. There shall be no accumulation of solid wastes
conductive to the breeding of rodents or insects.
(12) Stormwater. For all developments disturbing more than one acre,
New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
(NYSDEC) requires that municipalities receive a copy of the
stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) prior to plan
approval. The owner is required to comply with the NYSDEC's
SPDES general permit for stormwater discharge from construction
activity, Permit No. G-P-02-01.

§ 130-68. Nonconforming uses and buildings.
§ 130-69. Nonconforming lots. [Amended 10-15-2012 by L.L. No.
2-2012]
A. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the lawful use of land or
buildings existing on the date of the adoption of this chapter may be
continued although such use of building does not conform to the
regulations specified in this chapter. However, the following provisions
shall apply to all such nonconforming uses:
(1) No nonconforming lot shall be further reduced in size.
(2) After the date of adoption, no nonconforming building shall be
enlarged, extended or increased unless such enlargement would
tend to reduce the degree of nonconformance. This shall not be
interpreted to prohibit additions to residential dwellings that do not
impact the degree of nonconformance with regard to setbacks or
minimum lot size.
B. Discontinuance. In any district, whenever a nonconforming use of land,
premises, building or structure, or any part or portion thereof, has been
discontinued for a period of 365 consecutive days, such nonconforming
use shall not be reestablished, and all future uses shall be in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter. Such discontinuance applies to all
active and continuous operations of a nonconforming use, or a part or
portion thereof, regardless of any lack of intent to abandon the same or
regardless of intent to resume active operations at a later date. If actual
abandonment in fact is evidenced by the removal of buildings,
structures, machinery, equipment and other evidences of such
considered to be completed, and all rights to reestablish or continue
such nonconforming use shall thereupon terminate.
C. A nonconforming building may not be reconstructed or structurally
altered during its life to an extent exceeding in aggregate cost 50% of
the assessed value of the building, unless said building is changed to
conform to the requirements of this chapter.
D. Changes. Once changed to a conforming use, no building or land shall
be permitted to revert to a nonconforming use.
A. A residential lot existing at the time of passage of this chapter which is
less than the required area or width or cannot meet the required front
setback for any residential use in the district and was owned or under
contract for purchase by persons other than those owning or leasing
adjoining lots at the time of adoption of these regulations may be used
for residential purposes, provided that the lot has a front setback equal
§ 130-68 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-69
1:357
to at least 60% of the required minimum and that minimum side and
rear setback requirements can be met.
B. A commercial lot existing at the time of passage of this chapter which is
less than the required area or width or cannot meet the required front
setback for any commercial use in the district and was owned or under
contract for purchase by persons other than those owning or leasing
adjoining lots at the time of adoption of these regulations may be used
for commercial purposes, provided that the lot has a front setback equal
to at least 60% of the required minimum and that minimum side and
rear setback requirements can be met.

The following standards are intended to implement the Village's long-term
planning goals by assuring an acceptable degree of buffering between land
uses, particularly between residential and nonresidential uses, providing a
balance between developed uses and open space, enhancing the visual and
aesthetic appearance of the community and encouraging preservation of
existing natural features. Specifically, these regulations are intended to:
§ 130-71. Applicability.
These landscaping regulations shall apply to all uses in all districts. Within
the MU-2 District, whenever the requirements of this article vary from the
requirements of the design standards found in § 130-36, the most restrictive
or those imposing the higher standards shall govern. More specifically,
requirements and procedures shall be as follows:
A. Provide natural visual screening of parking areas and along property
boundaries to protect the existing visual quality of adjacent lands.
B. Reduce surface runoff and minimize soil erosion through the natural
filtering capability of landscaped areas.
C. Provide natural buffers that reduce glare and noise, provide wildlife
corridors and protect wildlife habitats, wetlands, stream corridors and
other significant environmental features.
D. Moderate the microclimate of parking areas by providing shade,
absorbing reflected heat from paved surfaces and creating natural
windbreaks.
E. Enhance the overall visual quality of the community by surrounding
developed areas with a variety of plant materials that are consistent
and compatible with the existing natural vegetation of the area.
A. Building permits for construction of new single-family or two-family
dwelling major subdivisions shall require preservation of existing
vegetation or plantings to provide two shade trees of a minimum twoinch
caliper, measured in accordance to American Standards for
Nursery Stock (ANSI), for each dwelling. Such tree(s) shall be located
outside the public right-of-way in the front yard.
B. Major residential subdivisions shall be required to submit landscaping
plans in accordance with § 130-73 of this chapter indicating
appropriate landscaping of entrances, common open spaces and
recreation areas and perimeter buffer areas.

C. Development activities requiring site plan approval shall submit, as
part of such approval, a landscaping plan in accordance with § 130-73
of this chapter.
A. Existing site vegetation and unique site features, such as stone walls,
shall be incorporated into landscaping plans to the maximum extent
feasible. Existing healthy trees which are retained shall be credited
against the requirements of these regulations in accordance with their
size and location.
B. Issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall require completion of lot
grading, seeding and required landscaping or posting of a performance
guaranty acceptable to the Code Enforcement Officer if the applicant
cannot perform the work due to seasonal impracticalities.
C. All required landscaping shall be of healthy stock, planted according to
accepted horticultural practices. Landscaping plans shall clearly
indicate who is responsible for plant maintenance during the first 12
months after planting, and a performance guaranty shall be posted for
assuring replacement in kind of plants which die or become diseased
within that time.
D. All required landscaping shall be maintained in healthy condition.
Failure to maintain such landscaping or to replace dead or diseased
landscaping required by this chapter shall constitute a violation of
these regulations.
E. All plant material adjacent to parking areas, loading areas and
driveways shall be protected by barriers, curbs or other means from
damage by vehicles or from stormwater runoff.
F. Where existing conditions make compliance with these regulations not
feasible, the Planning Board, at its discretion, may approve planters,
plant boxes or pots containing trees, shrubs and/or flowers to comply
with the intent of these regulations.
G. In cases where the edge of pavement within a public right-of-way does
not coincide with the front lot line, the property owner shall be
responsible for maintenance and landscaping in the area between the
front lot line and the edge of the street pavement.
H. Trees for screening shall be of species and stock that will provide a
visual screen from the ground up, at least five feet in height.

Off-Street Parking and Loading Regulations
§ 130-74. Intent.
The intent of this article is to prevent or alleviate congestion on public
streets and to promote the public safety and welfare by establishing
standards for the provision of off-street parking and loading spaces.
§ 130-75. Applicability.
§ 130-76. Location of required spaces.
Parking and loading spaces shall be located in accordance with the
following:
A. In all districts, every industrial, business, institutional, recreational,
residential or other use shall provide, at the time of any change of use
or when any building or structure is erected, enlarged or increased in
capacity in the Village, off-street parking for motor vehicles in
accordance with the requirements of this and other applicable sections
of these regulations, especially site plan approval in accordance with
Article XIV and landscaping with Article IX.
B. Loading spaces shall be provided and maintained on the same premises
with every building or structure erected, occupied, enlarged or
intended to be used, involving the receipt or distribution by vehicles of
material or merchandise. No such activity shall use public right-of-way
or parking area for standing, loading and unloading services.
C. Bus, taxi or passenger loading spaces may also be required, depending
on the use.
A. Parking areas set back from lot lines and streets. In all districts, no part
of any parking area, other than driveways for ingress and egress, shall
be located closer to a street or lot line than the minimum setback
required for a principal building in the relevant district. An exception
shall be made for a single row of convenience parking, as defined by
§ 130-82A and demonstrated by § 130-36H(3)(b)[1][a].
B. Parking of motor vehicles is prohibited on sidewalks, areas between the
sidewalk and curb and median strips separating travel lanes as defined
in the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law.
C. For single-family detached, semidetached, two-family, attached and
accessory dwelling units, off-street parking shall be provided on the
same lot with the building it serves.
D. For multifamily dwellings, required off-street parking shall be located
as close to the use as possible, given site conditions, and in no case
more than 200 feet from the building it is required to serve.
§ 130-74 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-76
1:363
§ 130-77. Computation of required spaces.
§ 130-78. Exceptions.
At the discretion of the Planning Board, uses within 500 feet of a municipal
parking lot or designated on-street parking may be wholly or partially
exempt from off-street parking requirements. Such uses may be required
to make a cash payment in lieu of providing off-street parking with such
moneys dedicated to expansion or improvement of public parking facilities
within the same commercial district.
§ 130-79. Alternate parking arrangements.
E. Access drives to any commercial or industrial district through any
residential district shall not be considered to be a permitted use.
F. The location, dimensions and signage of handicapped parking shall
meet the requirements of the New York State Codes, Rules and
Regulations.
A. If spaces are provided on the basis of employees or participants, the
number on the maximum shift or peak period shall be used.
B. Unless otherwise specified, off-street parking standards are based on
square feet of all floor area, including the area of any accessory
buildings.
A. The collective provision of off-street parking areas for two or more
buildings or uses located on adjacent lots is permitted. Unless it has
been demonstrated that joint use is appropriate in accordance with
Subsection C below, the total of such off-street parking facilities shall
not be less than the sum required for the various buildings or uses
computed separately. Furthermore, the land upon which the collective
facilities are located must be owned or leased by one or more of the
collective users.
B. Off-site parking. Off-site parking meeting the location requirements of
§ 130-76 may be used to meet the requirements of this chapter. Such
off-site parking shall be subject to deed, lease or contract restrictions
acceptable to the Municipal Attorney binding the owner, heirs or
assigns to maintain the required number of spaces available throughout
the life of such use.
C. Joint use. The off-street parking requirement of two or more uses,
structures or parcels of land may be shown by the owners or operators
of the uses, structures or parcels that their operations and parking
needs do not overlap at any point in time. If the uses, structures or
parcels are under separate ownership, the right to joint use of the
parking space must be evidenced by a deed, lease, contract or other
appropriate written document to establish the joint use.
§ 130-76 GENESEO CODE § 130-80
1:364
§ 130-80. Nonconforming parking and loading.
No building or lot alterations nor change of use shall be allowed which
would increase the degree of nonconformity with the off-street parking and
loading regulations of this chapter.
§ 130-81. Off-street parking and loading standards by usage.
The listed parking standards reflect reasonable standards for uses in most
locations. The Geneseo Village Board, in adopting these standards, is
providing guidance to future developers, tenants and residents of uses
requiring off-street parking and loading. From an environmental,
community character and cost perspective, it is always desirable to
construct the least number of parking spaces to accommodate a particular
use. The following general requirements apply to all off-street parking.
A. Applicants are encouraged to provide evidence of lessor parking and
loading demand if appropriate.
B. The Planning Board, at its discretion, may require less off-street
parking or loading if warranted based on the information presented. In
any case where less off-street parking is required, the Planning Board
reserves the right to require the set-aside of additional open space
sufficient to accommodate the amount of off-street parking which would
ordinarily be required.
C. The Planning Board also reserves the right to request additional
information, such as but not limited to expected number of employees,
participants, expected attendance or expected deliveries, relevant to
judging the adequacy of listed parking and loading standards. Such
information may result in application of off-street parking standards
higher than those listed.
D. For uses not listed, the required number of off-street parking or loading
spaces shall be determined by the Planning Board based on similarity to
listed uses and information provided by the applicant.
E. In all cases, the provided off-street parking and loading should be
sufficient to prevent frequent on-street parking by users or employees
or the loading and unloading of passengers or materials from the public
right-of-way in such a manner that is disruptive to traffic.
F. In addition to the off-street parking limits based on the following
standards, one appropriately sized parking space shall be available for
each commercial vehicle used in any business conducted on or from the
premises.
G. The Planning Board reserves the right to require off-street parking
spaces suitable for vehicles with boats or trailers in the Village.
H. Parking of any tractor-trailer combinations, except in conjunction with
provision of a commercial service to an owner or occupant of the
§ 130-80 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-81
1:365
property, shall be prohibited in any residential or transitional district.
The parking of one tractor without an attached trailer which is owned
by or leased to the occupant of a dwelling is allowed, subject to the
availability of an off-street parking space which meets all the
requirements of these regulations.
I. Adequate off-street parking space(s) shall be provided for any
commercial, residential, institutional or industrial use which involves
receipt or distribution of goods. [Amended 10-15-2012 by L.L. No.

A. All parking areas shall be located to the side or rear of the primary use.
In some instances, at the discretion of the Planning Board, one row of
convenience parking, not to exceed the primary building front length,
may be located to the front of the primary structure if sufficient space is
available and an appropriate ingress and egress point is located with
adequate buffering provided to separate the parking area from the
roadway.
B. The size of standard perpendicular off-street parking spaces shall be a
minimum of nine feet wide by 20 feet long.
C. All parking areas, passageways and driveways serving commercial or
industrial uses shall be illuminated adequately during the hours
between sunset and sunrise when the parking areas are in operation.
Adequate shielding shall be provided by commercial and industrial uses
to protect adjacent residential uses from the glare of such illumination
and from that of automobile headlights.

required radii for said driveway. Exceptions shall be made in cases
where the required rear or side setback for a detached garage,
according to the Bulk and Use Tables of this code, is shorter than 20
feet. In such cases, the minimum setback required for such structure
will be applied to the minimum setback for the driveway. The distances
from the driveway to the intersection shall be measured by extending
the curbline of the intersecting street until it intersects the curbline,
extending if necessary, of the driveway in question.
I. Driveways shall be designed to provide for the safe and efficient
movement of traffic between the roadway and the site, to eliminate the
potential for stacking of vehicles along the public right-of-way and to
minimize interference with pedestrians and vehicles using the site and
the public right-of-way.

permit has been issued shall not be modified, relocated, altered, or
replaced, nor shall design elements of any building or lot upon which
such sign is maintained be modified, relocated, altered, or replaced if
any such design element constituted a basis for approval of such sign
unless an amended or new sign permit is obtained consistent with these
regulations.

§ 130-86. Regulations applicable to all signs.
The following regulations are applicable to all signs within the Village of
Geneseo unless specifically stated otherwise within this section:
A. Traffic safety. All signs shall be designed, constructed, and located in
accordance with the following criteria:
(1) No sign shall be erected at or near any intersection of any streets,
or alleys, or any railway and any street, in such a manner as to
obstruct free and clear vision.

signs and window signs conforming in all respects with the
requirements of this chapter, all signs shall be constructed of
permanent, weather-resistant, and durable materials.
(2) Sign supports and braces. All permanent signs shall be supported

and setback requirements contained in the Table of Sign
Regulations.30
§ 130-86 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-86
1:371
(2) Off-premises signs are prohibited. All permanent signs shall be
located on the site being promoted, identified or advertised. Signs
for uses in New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets
Agricultural Districts are exempt from this provision.
(3) No sign shall cover any part of any window unless specifically
permitted under this chapter. No sign shall cover any door, or
hinder or prevent free ingress to or free egress from any door,
window, fire escape, or other required exitway.
(4) Altering or covering of architectural details is prohibited. No sign
shall cover or cause the removal of architectural details to a
building facade, including, but not limited to, arches, sills,
moldings, cornices, and transom windows.
(5) All signs, unless otherwise noted within this article, are to be set
back at least five feet from any property line or public right-of-way.
D. Illumination. Any illuminated sign shall be in accordance with the
following standards:
(1) Brightness. Light sources for illuminated signs shall not be of such
brightness as to constitute a hazard to pedestrians or motorists and
shall be shielded so as not to cast an illumination of more than two
footcandles on contiguous properties nor more than 0.1 footcandle
on residential properties.
(2) Electric considerations. All light fixtures and wiring shall comply
with the National Electrical Code. Electrified signs shall bear an
approved testing laboratory label, and all electrical connections

§ 130-86 GENESEO CODE § 130-86
1:372
§ 130-87. Measurement.
F. Protection of property. Signs shall not be posted in any manner
destructive to public property. Signs shall also not be attached or
otherwise applied to trees, utility poles, transit shelters, benches, trash
receptacles, or newsracks.
G. Obsolete signs. Any sign that no longer advertises or identifies the
current or permitted use of the property must be removed within 30
days after written notification from the Code Enforcement Officer.
A. Sign area.
(1) Computation of individual sign area. The area of a sign shall be
computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle,
triangle, or geometric combination thereof that will encompass the
extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, and/or other
display, together with any material or color forming an integral part
of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign
from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed.
(2) Computation of multifaced sign area. In the case of a multifaced
sign, the total of all sides of the sign shall be considered in
determining sign area.
(3) Structural support not included in sign area. The supporting
structure or bracing of a sign shall not be computed as part of the
sign area, unless such supporting structure or bracing is made a
part of the sign's message by including a symbol, logo, or other
three-dimensional figure. If such is the case, a combination of
regular geometric shapes which can encompass the area of said
symbol or figure shall be included as part of the total sign area
computation.
(4) Combining individual elements. For a sign composed of individual
letters, figures, or elements mounted on a wall or wall extension,
the area of such sign shall be calculated by determining the
smallest geometric form or combination of forms that comprise all
the display area, including the space between the elements.
B. Sign height.
(1) Computation of height of freestanding sign. The height of a
freestanding sign shall be calculated by measuring the vertical
distance between the top part of such sign or its structure,
whichever is highest, to the elevation of the ground directly
beneath the center of the sign. The elevation of the ground directly
beneath the center of the sign shall be construed to be the lower of
the existing grade prior to construction or the newly established
grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming,
mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign.
§ 130-86 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-87
1:373
§ 130-88. Signs authorized without permit.
The following types of signs may be erected in the Village without obtaining
a sign permit. Although permits are not required for these signs, the signs
shall conform to the height, setback and size requirements detailed in this
chapter:
(2) Computation of height of building signs. The height of an awning,
canopy, projecting wall, or window sign shall be determined by
measuring the vertical distance between the top part of a sign
panel or individual letter or character, whichever is highest, to the
elevation of the ground underneath such sign.
(3) Structural support included in sign height. Any material whose
major function is to provide structural support for a sign shall be
considered part of the sign for purposes of determining sign height.
C. Frontage.
(1) Freestanding sign frontage. The term "frontage," as used in
calculating freestanding signs, shall refer to the dimension of the
lot along the street.
(2) Wall sign frontage. The term "frontage," as used in calculating wall
signs, shall refer to the building wall dimension facing the street or
parking lot.
(3) More than one frontage. If a use or structure contains walls facing
more than one street line, the number of signs and sign areas will
be computed separately for each side of the building facing a
different frontage.
(4) No direct frontage. For uses or structures having no direct frontage
on public roads, as within shopping centers, frontage shall be
counted as the intersection of the building line onto adjacent drives
or parking areas.
A. Banners or pennants. Such signs shall not require a sign permit if all
the following conditions are met:
(1) There shall be no more than one banner per enterprise at one time;
(2) It shall be displayed for no more than 30 days;
(3) It shall not have a total face area in excess of 150 square feet nor a

ARTICLE XII
Telecommunications Facilities
§ 130-94. Towers.
A. Purpose. The purpose of these supplemental regulations is to promote
health, safety and the general welfare of the residents of the Village of
Geneseo; to provide standards for the safe provision of
telecommunications consistent with applicable federal and state
regulations; to minimize the total number of telecommunications
towers in the community by encouraging shared use of existing and
future towers and the use of existing tall buildings and other high
structures; and to minimize adverse visual effects from
telecommunications towers by requiring careful siting, visual impact
assessment and appropriate landscaping.
B. General criteria. No special use permit or renewal thereof or
modification of a current special use permit relating to a
telecommunications facility shall be authorized by the Planning Board
unless it finds that such telecommunications facility:
(1) Is necessary to meet current or expected demands for service.
(2) Conforms with all applicable regulations promulgated by the
Federal Communications Commission, Federal Aviation
Administration and other federal agencies.
(3) Is considered a public utility in the State of New York.
(4) Is designed and constructed in a manner which minimizes visual
impact to the extent practical.
(5) Complies with all other requirements of this section, unless
expressly superseded herein.
(6) Is the most appropriate site among those available within the
technically feasible area for the location of a telecommunications
facility.
(7) When including the construction of a tower, such tower is designed
to accommodate future shared use by at least one other
telecommunications service provider. Any subsequent location of
telecommunications equipment by other service providers on
existing towers specifically designed for shared use shall not
require a new or modified special permit if there would be no
increase in the height of the tower. However, the additional
equipment will require site plan review.
C. Co-location. The shared use of existing telecommunications facilities or
other structures shall be preferred to the construction of new facilities.
Any special use permit application, renewal or modification thereof
shall include proof that reasonable efforts have been made to co-locate
§ 130-94 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-94
1:383
within (share) an existing telecommunications facility or upon an
existing structure. The application shall include an adequate inventory
report specifying telecommunications facility sites and structures
exceeding 75% of the height of the proposed tower within the search
range of the cell grid. The inventory report shall contain an evaluation
of opportunities for shared use as an alternative to the proposed
location. The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed
telecommunications facility cannot be accommodated on existing
telecommunications facility sites in the inventory due to one or more of
the following reasons:
(1) The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of
existing and approved telecommunications facilities or other
structures, considering existing and planned use for those
facilities.
(2) The planned equipment would cause radio frequency interference
with other existing or planned equipment which cannot be
reasonably prevented.
(3) Existing or approved telecommunications facilities or other
structures do not have space on which proposed equipment can be
placed so it can function effectively and reasonably.
(4) Other technical reasons make it impracticable to place the
equipment proposed by the applicant on existing facilities or
structures.
(5) The property owner or owner of the existing telecommunications
facility or other structure refuses to allow such co-location.
D. New tower at a new location.
(1) The Board may consider a new telecommunications facility on a site
not previously developed with an existing tower when the applicant
demonstrates that shared use of existing tall structures and
existing or approved towers is impractical, as described in
§ 130-94C.
(2) New towers: future shared use. The applicant shall design a
proposed new telecommunications facility to accommodate future
demand for reception and transmitting facilities. The applicant
shall submit to the Board a letter of intent committing the owner of
the proposed new tower and his/her successors in interest to
negotiate in good faith for shared use of the proposed tower by
other telecommunications providers in the future. This letter shall
be filed with the Building Inspector prior to issuance of a building
permit. Failure to abide by the conditions outlined in the letter may
be grounds for revocation of the special use permit.
E. Dimensional standards.
§ 130-94 GENESEO CODE § 130-94
1:384
(1) A fall zone around any tower constructed as part of a
telecommunications facility must have a radius at least equal to 1.5
times the height of the tower and any antenna(s) attached upon its
zenith. The entire fall zone must have a radius of at least 75 feet,
may not include public roads and must be located on property
either owned or leased by the applicant or for which the applicant
has obtained an easement, and may not contain any structure other
than those associated with the telecommunications facility. If the
facility is attached to an existing structure, relief may be granted
by specific permission of the Zoning Board of Appeals on a case-bycase
basis.
(2) Each telecommunications facility shall be located on a single
parcel.
(3) All telecommunications facilities shall comply with the setback
standards of the underlying zoning district. The size of the leased
or owned lot shall be, at a minimum, sufficiently large to include
the entire fall zone. A lot leased or owned for the purpose of
construction of a tower as part of a telecommunications facility
shall not result in the creation of a nonconforming lot.
(4) The frontage requirement of the underlying zoning district shall not
apply, provided that the telecommunications facility is not proposed
on a parcel to be partitioned specifically for the facility and/or is
designed for occupancy by staff. In the absence of required
frontage, an accessway for service vehicles, either through
easement, lease or ownership, shall be in accord with § 130-94H
herein.
F. Lighting and marking. Towers shall not be artificially lighted and
marked beyond requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA).
G. Appearance and buffering.
(1) The use of any portion of a telecommunications facility for signs,
promotional or advertising purposes, including but not limited to
company name, phone numbers, banners, streamers and balloons,
is prohibited.
(2) The facility shall have the least practical visual effect on the
environment as determined by the Planning Board. Any tower that
is not subject to FAA marking, pursuant to § 130-94F herein, shall
otherwise:
(a) Have a galvanized finish or shall be painted gray above the
surrounding tree line and gray or green below the tree line, as
deemed appropriate by the Planning Board; or
§ 130-94 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-94
1:385
(b) Be disguised or camouflaged to blend in with the surroundings,
to the extent that such alteration does not impair the ability of
the facility to perform its designed function.
(3) Accessory structures shall maximize the use of building materials,
colors and textures designed to blend in with the natural
surroundings.
(4) The Planning Board may require a State Environmental Quality
Review (SEQR) full EAF (environmental assessment form) for
proposed facilities at key viewpoints in the community. A visual
environmental assessment form (visual EAF) may be required as an
addendum to either the full or short EAF. The Planning Board may
require submittal of a more detailed analysis based on the results
of the visual EAF.
(5) The Planning Board shall require that the facility have appropriate
vegetative buffering around the fences of the tower base area,
accessory structures and the anchor points of guyed towers to
buffer their view from neighboring residences, recreation areas or
public roads. Such screening shall include the maximum feasible
retention of existing vegetation. The Planning Board may similarly
require screening adjacent to waterways, landmarks, refuges,
community facilities or conservation or historic areas within
common view of the public.
(6) Equipment or vehicles not used in direct support, renovations,
additions or repair of any telecommunications facility shall not be
stored or parked on the facility site.
H. Access and parking.
(1) Accessways shall make maximum use of existing public or private
roads to the extent practicable. New accessways constructed solely
for telecommunications facilities must be at least 20 feet but no
more than 30 feet wide and closely follow natural contours to
assure minimal visual disturbance and reduce soil erosion
potential.
(2) The road surface (driveways) shall be centered within accessways
and shall not comprise more than 60% of the width of the
accessway.
(3) Parking areas shall be sufficient to accommodate the greatest
number of service vehicles expected on the premises at any one
time.
(4) Driveways or parking areas shall provide adequate interior
turnaround, such that service vehicles will not have to back out
onto a public thoroughfare.
I. Security.
§ 130-94 GENESEO CODE § 130-94
1:386
(1) Towers, anchor points of guyed towers, and accessory structures
shall each be surrounded by fencing at least eight feet in height,
the top foot of which may, at the discretion of the Planning Board in
deference to the character of the neighborhood, be composed of
three strands of barbed wire to discourage unauthorized access to
the site.
(2) Motion-activated or staff-activated security lighting around the
base of a tower or accessory structure entrance may be provided if
such lighting does not project off the site. Such lighting should only
occur when the area within the fenced perimeters has been
entered.
(3) There shall be no permanent climbing pegs within 15 feet of the
ground of any tower.
(4) A locked gate at the junction of the accessway and a public
thoroughfare may be required to obstruct entry by unauthorized
vehicles. Such gate must not protrude into the public right-of-way.
J. Engineering and maintenance.
(1) Site plans for all telecommunications facilities must bear the seal of
a professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of New
York. Every facility shall be built, operated and maintained to
acceptable industry standards, including but not limited to the
most recent applicable standards of the Institute of Electric and
Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI).
(2) Every facility shall be inspected at least every second year for
structural integrity by a New York State licensed engineer. A copy
of the inspection report shall be submitted to the Municipal Code
Enforcement Officer.
(3) A safety analysis by a qualified professional must accompany any
special permit or site plan application, renewal thereof or
modification for the purpose of certifying that general public
electromagnetic radiation exposure does not exceed standards set
by federal regulations.
(4) The municipality, at the expense of the applicant, may employ its
own consulting assistance to review the findings and conclusions of
safety analysis, visual analysis or structural inspection provided by
the applicant.
K. Removal.
(1) At the time of submittal of the application of a special use permit
for a telecommunications facility, the applicant shall submit an
agreement to remove all antennas, driveways, structures,
buildings, equipment sheds, lighting, utilities, fencing, gates,
§ 130-94 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-94
1:387
accessory equipment or structures, as well as any tower(s)
dedicated solely for use within a telecommunications facility, if
such facility becomes technologically obsolete or ceases to perform
its originally intended function for more than 12 consecutive
months. Such agreement shall also include a commitment by the
applicant to impose a similar obligation to remove any unused
and/or obsolete telecommunications facility upon any person
subsequently securing rights to co-locate on the
telecommunications facility. Upon removal of said facility, the land
shall be restored to its previous condition, including but not limited
to the seeding of exposed soils.
(2) Bond/security.
(a) The applicant shall be required to execute and file with the
Village Clerk a bond or other form of security acceptable to the
Village Attorney as to form and manner of execution, in an
amount sufficient in the reasonable discretion of the Village,
for the faithful performance of the terms and conditions of the
permit or approval issued hereunder, for the observation of all
Village local laws or ordinances, to cover the maintenance of
the tower during its lifetime and to provide for the removal and
restoration of the site subsequent to its removal. The amount
required shall be determined by the Village Planning Board.
The amount of the bond or security shall be no less than 150%
of the cost of removal of the tower and restoration of the site
and shall be reviewed and adjusted at five-year intervals.
(b) In the event of default upon performance of such conditions or
any one of them, the bond or security shall be forfeited to the
Village of Geneseo, which shall be entitled to maintain an
action thereon. The bond or security shall remain in full force
and effect until the removal of the transmission tower,
telecommunications tower, communications installation,
freestanding tower, satellite dish, antenna, pole and/or
accessory facility/structure and site restoration.
L. Public hearing and notification of nearby landowners. The applicant
shall be required to mail notice of the public hearing directly to all
landowners whose property is located within 500 feet of the property
line of the parcel on which a new tower is proposed. Notice shall also be
mailed to the administrator of any state or federal parklands from
which the proposed tower would be visible if constructed. Notification,
in all cases, shall be made by certified mail no sooner than 14 days or
later than seven days before the scheduled hearing. Documentation of
this notification shall be submitted to the Board prior to the public
hearing.
§ 130-94 GENESEO CODE § 130-95

ARTICLE XIII
Subdivision of Land
§ 130-96. General provisions.
§ 130-97. Design standards.
A. Authority. The Planning Board of the Village of Geneseo, New York, has
the power and authority to approve plans for the subdivision of land
within its limits by virtue of a resolution adopted by the Village Board
on the sixth day of October 1958, pursuant to the provisions of § 179K,
Chapter 64, of the Consolidated Village Law, Article VIA, as amended,
and now recodified as § 7-728. The Planning Board may also, by
authority of this article, approve the development of plats, entirely or
partially undeveloped, which were filed in the office of the County Clerk
prior to the appointment of such Planning Board and the grant to such
Board of the power to approve plats.
B. Compliance required; applicability.
(1) No subdivision of any lot, tract or parcel of land shall be effected
and no street, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water main or other
facilities in connection therewith shall be laid out, constructed,
opened or dedicated for public use and travel or for the common
use of -occupants of buildings abutting thereon except in strict
accordance with the provisions of this article.
(2) All plans for subdivisions shall be submitted to the Planning Board
and approved by it before they shall be recorded.
(3) The provisions contained herein shall apply to all land within the
incorporated area of the Village.
C. Purpose. This article has been adopted for the purpose of providing for
the future growth and development of the Village and for the purpose of
affording adequate facilities for the housing, transportation,
distribution, comfort, convenience, safety, health and welfare of the
population of the Village.
D. Title. This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Village of
Geneseo Subdivision Regulations."
A. Establishment; applicability.
(1) The design standards and requirements outlined in this article will
be applied by the Planning Board in evaluating plans for all
proposed subdivisions.
(2) The Design Criteria and Construction Specifications of the Village
of Geneseo are adopted herein by reference and shall establish the
standard for subdivision design and construction.
§ 130-96 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-97
1:391
(3) The following general design standards shall also be used by the
Board to evaluate the appropriate design of subdivisions. These
standards are intended to be consistent with the Design Criteria
and Construction Specifications; if in conflict, the more specific
standards of the Design Criteria and Construction Specifications
shall apply.
(4) Within the MU-2 District, whenever the requirements of this article
vary from the requirements of the Design Standards found in
§ 130-36, the most restrictive or those imposing the higher
standards shall govern.
B. General standards.
(1) Land requirements. Land shall be suited to the purpose for which it
is to be subdivided. Land subjected to periodic flooding or other
hazards to life, health or property shall not be subdivided unless
adequate safeguards against such hazards are provided by the plan
and approved by the Planning Board.
(2) Comprehensive Plan and Official Map requirements.
(a) The layout of the proposed subdivision shall be in general
conformity with the features or developments proposed in the
adopted Comprehensive Plan and the Official Map.
(b) The Planning Board will consider the adequacy of the existing
or proposed community facilities to serve the uses proposed in
the subdivision. Where a proposed park, playground, school or
other public use shown in the Comprehensive Plan is located in
whole or in part in a subdivision, the Planning Board may
require the dedication or reservation of such area as may be
deemed reasonable. Areas provided or reserved for such
community facilities should be adequate to provide for building
sites, landscaping and off-street parking as appropriate to the
use proposed.
(3) On-lot sewage and water supply. Where either or both water supply
and sanitary sewage disposal are provided by individual on-lot
facilities and evidence indicates that the requirements of this
Chapter 130, Zoning, are not adequate, the Planning Board may
require tests, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
State Health Department undertaken at the expense of the
developer, to determine the adequacy of the proposed lot size and
existing grade and soil conditions. In all such cases where the tests
indicate a larger lot size to be necessary, the Planning Board may
employ the services of a registered and qualified independent
sanitary engineer for advice as to the minimum lot size and/or
facilities necessary to prevent unsanitary conditions and hazards to
the public health. In such cases, the cost of retaining the services of
a qualified engineer shall be borne by the developer.
§ 130-97 GENESEO CODE § 130-97
1:392
(4) Easements.
(a) Easements shall be provided for all utilities of a width
necessary for installation, repair and/or replacement of said
utility. The depth, type, size and location of a utility in addition
to soil conditions will be considered when establishing an
easement width, as required in the Design Criteria for utilities.
(b) To the fullest extent possible, easements shall be centered or
adjacent to rear or side lot lines.
(c) No structure shall have its foundation built less than five feet
from any easement line.
(d) Where a development is traversed by a watercourse, the
applicant shall provide to the Village at no cost a drainage
easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with the
line of such watercourse and of such width as will be adequate
to preserve natural drainage and maintain the same.
(5) Blocks.
(a) The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with
due regard to the following:
[1] Provisions of adequate sites for buildings of the type
proposed.
[2] Zoning requirements.
[3] Topography.
[4] Requirements for safe and convenient vehicular and
pedestrian circulation.
(b) Pedestrian interior walks may be required to assist circulation
or provide access to community facilities in blocks over 1,000
feet or to provide pedestrian walkway continuity within a given
subdivision. Such crosswalks shall have a width of not less than
10 feet and a paved walk of not less than five feet.
(6) Storm drainage. Lots shall be laid out to encourage positive
drainage away from proposed building areas, and wherever
desirable, natural drainage courses shall be maintained. Storm
drainage improvements shall be designed in accordance with the
Design Criteria and Construction Specifications.
(7) Design standards for streets.
(a) Street right-of-way widths. Minimum right-of-way widths for all
proposed streets shall conform to the requirements set forth in
the Design Criteria.
§ 130-97 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-97
1:393
(b) Geometric standards. Geometric design standards for all
proposed streets shall conform to the requirements set forth in
the Design Criteria.
(8) Street system layout.
(a) Proposed streets shall be properly related to such street plans
or parts thereof as have been officially prepared and adopted
by the Village, and they shall further conform to such county
and state road and highway plans as have been prepared,
adopted and/or filed as prescribed by law.
(b) Street systems shall be designed with due regard to the needs
for convenient traffic access and circulation; traffic control and
safety; access for fire-fighting, snow removal and street
maintenance equipment; and stormwater drainage and sewage
disposal. Streets shall be designed to accommodate the
prospective traffic and so arranged so as to separate through
traffic from neighborhood traffic insofar as it is practicable.
(c) Where a site is not directly served by a roadway or where an
existing roadway is inadequate to accommodate the project,
construction or improvement of roads not directly adjacent to
the proposed project may be required of the applicant by the
Village in order to provide sufficient access. The quantity of
improvements required shall be based on the needs of the
project. Sufficiency shall be determined by the Design Criteria
and Construction Specifications.
(d) Where a subdivision abuts on or contains an existing or
proposed arterial street, the Planning Board may require
necessary realignment and widening of the right-of-way in
accordance with county, Village or state standards and to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer. Frontage roads or parallel
access roads may be required to eliminate direct access to
arterial roads.
(e) The proposed street layout shall provide for the continuation or
projection of existing streets in the surrounding area unless
the Planning Board deems such extension(s) are not possible or
reasonable for specific reasons of topography or design. See
§ 130-97C(5) for cul-de-sac design standards.
(f) Streets shall be logically related to the topography to produce
usable lots and reasonable grades.
(g) Where necessary to join with existing roads, to allow for future
circulation or to obtain access to publicly owned lands, roads
shall be extended to the outside boundaries of the subdivision.
§ 130-97 GENESEO CODE § 130-97
1:394
(h) Adequate street rights-of-way shall be provided as necessary
where lots in the proposal are large enough to permit
resubdivision or if a portion of the tract is not subdivided.
(i) Wherever a tract to be subdivided borders an existing half or
partial street, the other part of the street shall be plotted
within such tract.
(j) Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs to permit
future street extension into adjoining tracts or when designed
as culs-de-sac to serve residential areas. See § 130-97C(5) for
cul-de-sac design standards.
(k) Where a subdivision contains or abuts an existing or proposed
railroad right-of-way, utility easement or controlled access
highway, the Planning Board may require a street
approximately parallel to and on either side of such right-ofway,
at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening lands. Appropriate uses to consider are parkland
with residential districts on for business, commercial or
industrial purpose in appropriate zoning districts. Such
distances shall also be determined with due regard for the
requirements of approach grades and future grade separation.
(l) Half streets shall be prohibited; however, the sharing of access
between two adjacent parcels is encouraged.
(m) Reserve strips shall be prohibited except where controlled by
the Village. However, the Planning Board may require the
reservation of an easement 30 feet wide for pedestrian traffic
or utilities.
(n) Where a street does not extend to the boundary of the
subdivision and its continuation is not needed for access to
adjoining property, it shall be separated from such boundary by
a distance sufficient to accommodate a lot meeting the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
(o) For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police
and fire protection, the length of permanent dead-end streets
shall generally be no longer than 500 feet, or five times the
minimum lot width for the zoning district, such length to be
measured to the center point of the cul-de-sac.
(p) Driveway access and grades shall be such that exiting and
entering vehicles pose no threat to vehicles on the roadway.
Driveway intersection design and grades shall be established
by the Design Criteria and Construction Specifications.
(9) Street intersections.
§ 130-97 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-97
1:395
(a) Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles. No street shall intersect another at an angle of
less than 75°.
(b) Multiple intersections involving the junction of more than two
streets shall be avoided. Where this proves impossible, such
intersections shall be designed with extreme care for both
pedestrian and vehicular safety.
(c) All property corners at street intersections shall be rounded
with a radius of 20 feet or have comparable cutoffs or chords,
as the Planning Board sees fit. Within triangular areas formed
by the intersecting street lines, for a distance of 75 feet from
their intersection, and the diagonals connecting the end points
of these lines, visibility for traffic safety shall be provided by
exclusions of plantings or structures and regrading as
necessary.
(d) To the fullest extent possible, intersections with arterial streets
shall be located not less than 1,000 feet apart, measured from
center line to center line. Separation between access
connections, or driveways to private development, are subject
to the provisions of § 130-42D.
(e) Local streets entering opposite sides of another street shall be
laid out either directly opposite one another or with a minimum
offset of 150 feet, except for collector or arterial streets, which
shall have a minimum center line offset of 800 feet.
(f) Minimum curb radii at street intersections shall be 30 feet for
intersections involving only local streets and may be enlarged
according to the Design Criteria depending upon the
classification of intersecting streets.
(g) Minimum right-of-way radii at street intersections shall be 20
feet for all intersections.
(h) Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing street of
inadequate right-of-way width, additional right-of-way width in
conformance with the Design Criteria and Construction
Specifications will be required.
(i) Grades within the intersection should not exceed 1%, while
they should not exceed 1 1/2% for a distance of 50 feet from
the intersection. From 50 feet to 100 feet, the grades should
not exceed 3%, and in no case shall they exceed 5%.
(10) Traffic safety. Traffic signs and safety devices shall be provided and
installed in accordance with the Design Criteria and Construction
Specifications. Clearance of obstacles to vision at the intersections,
provisions of merging tapers, channelization, signalization,
§ 130-97 GENESEO CODE § 130-97
1:396
pullovers and turning areas, fire lanes and school bus stopping
areas shall be provided where required by the Planning Board.
(11) Park and recreation requirements.
(a) Unless specifically waived by the Planning Board or unless
otherwise provided by Subsection B(11)(b) below, parklands
suitably located for playground or other recreational purposes,
of a size sufficient to serve the proposed subdivision, shall be
provided.
(b) In lieu of land dedicated for park purposes, the Planning Board
may require a per-lot fee, to be set from time to time by the
Board of Trustees, to be paid prior to issuance of a certificate
of occupancy. Any such funds received by the Village shall be
reserved and expended for the acquisition or development of
park or recreation lands within the Village.
(12) Drainage. Design considerations and improvements shall be
governed by the Design Criteria and Construction Specifications.
(13) Trees.
(a) The subdivider shall take adequate measures to preserve
desirable existing trees in suitable locations within the
subdivision.
(b) The Planning Board may also require the planting of trees
within the right-of-way or replacement of trees on private
property within the subdivision. Tree planting shall be
governed by the Design Criteria and Construction
Specifications.
(14) Street names and signs. All streets shall be named, and such names

conform to the provisions of this section.
(2) Residential lot sizes. Lot dimensions, areas, yards and building
setback lines shall be not less than specified by the provisions of
the Geneseo Village Zoning Law.
(3) Design of residential lots.
(a) Unless specifically waived by the Planning Board, all lots shall
front upon a public street, existing or proposed.
(b) Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to
street lines.
(c) If remnants of land exist after subdividing, they shall be

(d) Depth and width of parcels laid out or reserved for
nonresidential use shall be sufficient to provide satisfactory
space for off-street parking and unloading.
(e) Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided.
Double frontage lots may be acceptable to protect the traffic
capacity of arterial roads, to achieve greater public safety or to
reduce disturbance of the natural landscape. Any double
frontage lots shall have an average minimum depth of 120 feet.
(f) Corner lots shall be at least 10% wider than interior lots to
provide for proper building setbacks from each street and to
provide a desirable building site. Corner lots shall be curved
consistent with adopted road standards.
(g) Lots deeper than three times their width at the setback line
shall be avoided.
(h) Land subject to flooding or land deemed by the Planning Board
to be uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential
occupancy nor for such other uses as may increase danger to
health, life or property or aggravate the flood hazard, but such
land within the plat shall be set aside for such uses as shall not
be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or
improved in a manner satisfactory to the Planning Board to
remedy the hazardous conditions. The Planning Board may
require lot sizes in excess of the zoning requirement if it

1:398
unimpaired and the area of the easement comprises a usable
portion of the lot.
(j) Minimum lot width shall normally be measured at a distance of
25 feet from the edge of road right-of-way, except that lots
fronting on the circular part of a cul-de-sac shall be measured
tangentially at a distance of 35 feet from the edge of the rightof-
way. The Planning Board shall have authority to interpret lot
width and average lot depth for unusually shaped or situated
lots.
(4) Residential blocks.
(a) Block dimensions shall adequately reflect the needs of
convenient access and public safety, and limitations and
opportunities of topography, economics of land use and road
maintenance, and the provision of suitable sites for the land
use planned.
(b) Blocks shall not be less than 600 feet in length. In the design of
blocks longer than 800 feet, special consideration shall be
given to the requirements of satisfactory fire protection, utility
crossing and pedestrian crossing.
(c) Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth to accommodate
two tiers of lots, except where reverse frontage lots bordering
an arterial street are approved for use by the Planning Board.

notation on the subdivision plat providing for temporary
easements for the turnaround until such time as the street is
extended. These same requirements shall apply at the
§ 130-97 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-97
1:399
discretion of the Planning Board in those cases where the
adjoining land is another section of the same development and
is not scheduled for development at the same time.
(6) Garage placement. A front-facing garage shall not consist of more
than 40% of the total building frontage. The front facade of the
garage shall not be more than eight feet closer to the street than
the main building facade with the front door.
D. Commercial and industrial design standards.
(1) Application. All commercial and industrial subdivisions shall
conform to the provisions of this section.
(2) Size. Approval of lot or parcel size will be determined by the
following factors:
(a) The total area shall be sufficient to provide adequate space for
off-street parking and loading, landscaping and other facilities.
(b) Whenever possible, commercial parcels should include enough
land to provide for a group of commercial establishments
planned, developed and operated as a unit.

chapter.
(5) Utilities. Where possible, commercial and industrial subdivisions
should be located close to public utilities. Utilities shall be sized
commensurate with the demand anticipated upon full development
based upon the reasonable anticipated uses. In any case,
subdivisions should be provided by the contractor with such
utilities as are necessary to maintain adequate health standards
and to dispose of commercial and industrial wastes.
(6) Location.
(a) In general, commercial and industrial subdivisions should be
located adjacent or close to major highways and transportation
facilities.

1:400
§ 130-98. Improvements.
permitted, and provided that the site shall be in conformance
with this chapter.
(c) Notice. The face of the plat shall contain notice of the intended
use; however, this notice shall not be considered to waive or
prejudice the development review on the lots if covered by
other Village requirements.
A. Improvements required; waivers.
(1) Minimum improvements and construction standards required of all
subdivisions shall be as set forth in the Design Criteria and
Construction Specifications. Where not set forth, they shall be in
accordance with the prevailing standards as established by the
Planning Board. Alternate improvement standards may be
permitted if the Planning Board, upon advisement of the Village
Engineer, deems them equal or superior in performance
characteristics to the specified improvements. Additional or higher
type improvements may be required in specific cases by the
Planning Board in order to create conditions essential to health,
safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the
municipality.
(2) The Planning Board may, subject to appropriate conditions, waive
the provision of any or all such improvements and requirements
which in its judgment are not required in the interest of the public
health, safety and general welfare or which are inappropriate
because of the inadequacy of connecting facilities.
B. Monuments and markers. Monuments and markers shall be set in
conformance with requirements in the Design Criteria and
Construction Specifications.
C. Street pavements, curbs and sidewalks.

feet. The size, type and species of such trees shall be approved by
the Planning Board and their installation governed by the Design
Criteria.
E. Water supply.
(1) Provision of water supply. Where the public water supply, in the
opinion of the Planning Board, is reasonably accessible, the
subdivision shall be provided with a complete water distribution
system, including a connection for each lot and appropriately
spaced fire hydrants. Where the public water supply is not within
reasonable distance, an alternate supply, approved by the State
Department of Health, shall be furnished.

minimum lot size requirements specified in other sections of these
regulations or in any applicable zoning law are adequate to permit
the installation of individual on-lot water supply and/or sewage
disposal facilities, the Planning Board may require that the
subdivider request the State Department of Health to make such
tests as are necessary to determine the adequacy of the proposed
facilities in relation to the proposed lot size, existing grade and soil
conditions. In all cases, a certificate from such Health Department
indicating that the proposed facilities are adequate shall be
prerequisite to final approval of the plat.
(3) Capped sewers. Where the municipality has a plan for extending
the public sanitary sewer system into an area that is being
subdivided and it is reasonably expected that the area will be
served by the public system within a period of five years, capped
sewers shall be installed to adequately serve all lots in the
proposed subdivision.
(4) Type of sewer system. No combined sanitary and storm sewer
systems will be permitted.

necessary, for the location of television community antenna lines to
be installed in the easements. Electric power, telephone utility lines
and television community antenna lines shall be installed
underground.
(2) Gas transmission lines. When any subdivider proposes to provide
gas transmission lines within a subdivision, the gas transmission
lines shall be installed underground between the curbline and the
property line of any street right-of-way located on the opposite side
of the street from waterlines, if applicable.

maintenance and repair of the streets in the subdivision for one
year after the construction has been approved by the Planning
Board and acceptance of improvements has been
consummated by the municipality.
(2) The Village shall provide suitable inspectors to act as agents of the
Planning Board for the purpose of assuring a satisfactory
completion of improvements required by the Planning Board. The
applicant shall pay the costs of such inspection, as determined by
the Board, before the subdivision plat is signed for filing if the
subdivision plat is constructed prior to filing. If the subdivision plat
is authorized for filing prior to construction, the letter of credit
shall include anticipated costs of construction, and the release of
such funds is not authorized until the inspection costs are paid. If
the Planning Board or its agents find, upon inspection, that any of
the required improvements have not been constructed in
accordance with approved construction detail sheets, the applicant
and the bonding company will be severally and jointly liable for the
costs of completing the improvements according to specifications.

disapprove the final plat. After the approval of the final plat,
the Planning Board shall endorse its approval on two copies of
the final plat and shall return one such endorsed copy to the
subdivider. In the event of disapproval, the subdivider shall be
notified in writing with the reasons for disapproval stated.
(c) After the public hearing but prior to granting final approval,
the Planning Board may permit the final plat to be subdivided
into two or more sections and may impose such conditions
upon the filing of the sections as it may deem necessary to
assure the orderly development of the subdivision. The
approval of such sections may be made concurrently with the
approval of the final plat.
(4) Recording of approved final plat. [Amended 2-26-2018 by L.L.
No. 2-2018]
(a) The approval of the final plat or of an approved section of the
final plat shall expire in 62 days if such final plat or section
shall not have been filed or recorded by the subdivider in the
office of the County Clerk in accordance with § 7-728 of the
Village Law.
(b) If the subdivider elects to file only a section of an approved
final plat within the sixty-two-day period, the section shall
encompass at least 10% of the total number of lots contained in
the approved final plat, and the approval of the remaining
sections shall expire unless recorded within a three-year
period. In the event that the subdivider does not record all of
the approved sections in the County Clerk's office within the
sixty-two-day period, then the entire final plat shall be filed
with the Village Clerk within 30 days of the recording of any
section at the office of the County Clerk.

section. No decision shall be made on the preliminary plat until these
comments are received.

responsibility of the subdivider to bring such alleged inconsistency or
conflict to the Planning Board's attention, in writing, for a decision
regarding which standard shall apply, and its decision with respect to
matters under its jurisdiction shall be final and binding.
H. Standards and criteria for approval of residential open space
developments.
(1) Dimensional requirements. As authorized by this chapter,
§ 130-31H, the Planning Board may modify the dimensional
requirements of this chapter to allow for open space (cluster)
designs which promote the most appropriate use of land, facilitate
efficient provision of streets and utilities and preserve the natural,
recreational and scenic qualities of such land.
(2) Maximum number of dwelling units. In order to determine the
maximum number of dwelling units to be permitted in an open
space design, the applicant shall submit a sketch showing lot
layouts in conformance with the district zoning requirements for
minimum lot size, setbacks and road dimensions. A ten-percent
allocation for recreational purposes shall be set aside from the
buildable land, as required by § 130-96B(12).
(3) Natural features. The clustered subdivision plat shall indicate all
trees greater than four inches in diameter one foot above the
ground, or wooded areas as appropriate, and all other natural
features such as rock outcroppings, ponds, drainageways, etc.
(4) Provisions for preservation and maintenance of open space.
Permanent preservation of the open space and, in particular, the
trees, wooded areas or other natural features shown in the open
space subdivision plat shall be required, either through easements,
deed restrictions or as an obligation of any homeowners'
association created for the subdivision. The legal mechanism for
preserving and maintaining open space and natural features shall
be established to the satisfaction of the Planning Board before the
plat is approved for filing.
I. Modifications. If at any time before or during the construction of the
required improvements it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Village Engineer that unforeseen conditions make it necessary or
preferable to modify the location or design of such required
improvements, the Village Engineer may, upon approval by a previously
delegated member of the Planning Board, authorize modifications,
provided that these modifications are within the spirit and intent of the
Planning Board's approval and do not extend to the waiver or
substantial alteration of the function of any improvements required by
the Board. The Village Engineer shall issue any authorization under this
section in writing and shall transmit a copy of such authorization to the
Planning Board at its next regular meeting.
§ 130-100 GENESEO CODE § 130-100
1:412

grant the following modifications and variances subject to such
conditions which will, in its judgment, secure substantially the
objectives of the standards or requirements so varied or modified:
(1) Modification of plat requirements for small subdivisions. In the
case of a small subdivision, the final plat requirements may be
waived by the Planning Board as specified in § 130-99D.
(2) Hardship. The Planning Board may grant a variance to the
provisions contained herein if the applicant can sufficiently
demonstrate the following:
(a) The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that
lack of return is substantial, as demonstrated by competent
financial evidence;
(b) That the alleged hardship relating to the property in question
is unique and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood;
(c) That the requested variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood; and
(d) That the alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(e) That the variance will afford the least intrusive solution.
(3) Procedure for applying. Applications for modifications and
variances shall be submitted in writing by the subdivider at the
time the preliminary plat or final plat is filed with the Planning
Board. The application shall state fully the grounds and all the facts
relied upon by the applicant.
K. Violations; penalties for offenses.

Village Law. Any division attempted in violation hereof shall be
invalid.
(2) No permit shall be issued for development upon any lot, tract,
parcel or site created in violation of this article. Assignment of a tax
number or other mode of separate identification of a unit of land by
the Assessor for the purpose of tax administration shall not be
deemed to create or legitimize a division otherwise invalid
hereunder.
(3) In case of any violation or threatened violation of any of the
provisions of this article or conditions imposed by the Planning
Board, in addition to the remedies herein provided, the Village
Board may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to abate
such violation to prevent any illegal act conducted on or about such
premises.

of an offense, as defined in the Penal Law of the State of New York,

declared to constitute a separate and additional violation.

recommendation of the Planning Board or the Code Enforcement

opportunity to appear before the Planning Board or the Code

modified or amended as prescribed by local and state laws.

decisions and recommendations relative to all subdivision plats filed
with it for review and shall also keep a record of its actions and the

outward percolation can take place. Where removable watertight
containers are provided, they shall be located as far as practicable from
any reservoir or watercourse. All privies or receptacles referred to in
this regulation shall be constructed or installed only with the approval
and under the supervision of the Boards of Trustees of the Villages of
Avon and Geneseo and the Town Board of the Town of Livonia and in

ARTICLE II
Consumption of Water
[Adopted 7-5-1989]
§ A136-24. Rules and regulations.
A. All persons desiring to use Village water must apply to the Board of
Trustees or its designee stating the uses for which it is wanted. The
application shall be part of a contract by the consumer with the Village,
the consumer agreeing to use the water according to such rules and
regulations as may from time to time be adopted by the Board of
Trustees. The Board reserves the right to refuse any application.
B. No person except those authorized by the Board of Trustees shall be
allowed to tap the water mains under any circumstances whatsoever,
and no changes in any service pipes shall be made without the consent
of the Board or its designee.
C. All expenses attending the introduction and continuing supply of water
from the water main to and including the curb stop (municipal water
shutoff), up to a maximum diameter of one inch, shall be the
responsibility of the Village. Larger diameter services shall be the
responsibility of the consumer. Pipes, valves and other fixtures, except
the water meter,* beyond the curb stop are the responsibility of the
consumer. Any leaks beyond the curb stop must be promptly repaired
by the consumer. The consumer's failure to repair a leak within 14 days
after discovery of the leak will be cause for terminating the water
supply from the water main to the premises concerned at the expense of
the consumer. Water services will be resumed only after repair of all
leaks and payment of all expenses attending the shutoff and resumption
of water services, including reasonable attorney fees and any other
expenses involved in any court proceedings that may occur in the
process. (*Note: This does not include purchase of a water meter for
new construction.) [Amended 10-6-1997 by L.L. No. 4-1997;

D. The Board or its designee will determine the size of the tap to be
inserted.
E. All connections must be at right angles with the main; and all service
pipes shall be placed at a depth of at least 4 1/2 feet during their entire
length.
F. All curb cocks must have a round waterway and be of such pattern as
may be adopted by the Board, and no others will be allowed.
G. Hydrants, taps, hose, water closets, urinals, baths or other fixtures will
not be permitted to be kept running when not in actual use; and all
water closets and urinals must be provided with self-closing valves; and
in no case shall any bib or faucet be allowed to be placed over any closet
or urinal.
§ A136-24 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A136-24
1:449

J. The officers of the Village and their agents and assistants may enter the
premises of any consumer at any reasonable time to examine the pipes
and fixtures, the quantity of water used and the manner of its use; and
in case of fraudulent representation on the part of any consumer or
unnecessary waste of water, the water supply will be stopped.
K. The Board reserves the right to shut off the water from any street or
premises at any time they may deem it necessary.
L. Any person wishing to discontinue the use of water or to settle an
account due to sale of the property must give notice to the Village.
M. The Board reserves the right to attach meters to any service pipes at
any time and charge for the quantity of water used. Those water rates
will be established by the Board of Trustees from time to time.
N. All water rates will be payable quarterly. Penalties for late payment of
water charges shall be established from time to time by the Board of
Trustees. The Superintendent of Public Works or his designee may shut
off the water supply in cases where bills are not paid in a timely fashion.
An extra charge will be made in all cases for turning it on again. All
outstanding water and sewer charges on May 31 shall be added to the
property tax rolls.
O. No person shall hitch any animal to any hydrant; nor shall be open or
interfere with the hydrants or valves or other waterworks fixtures of
this Village without proper authority. Violations of this rule will subject
the offender to a penalty as set by the Board.
P. All persons using water without authorization will be charged double
rates for the time the water is so used.
Q. These rules and tariff regulations are subject to change at any time by
the Village Board of Trustees.
A. The application must be signed by the legal owners of the real estate.
B. The applications must be for permanent residences, building or
structures and not for trailers or other temporary services.

may require the property owner to install a backflow preventer. Such
backflow preventer shall be designed and installed in accordance with

approved by the Superintendent of Public Works prior to installation.
All costs of installation and maintenance shall be borne by the property

(6) Chemical laboratories and plating facilities.
