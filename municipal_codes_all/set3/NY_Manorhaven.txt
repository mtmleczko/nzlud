ALARMS, SILENT
GENERAL REFERENCES
Noise — See Ch. 97.
§ 25-1. Legislative findings; purpose and intent.
A. The unregulated transmission of automatic tape alarm systems in the
village has, from time to time, resulted in the overtaxing of facilities and
in the impairment of the ability of the Police and Fire Departments to
respond to true emergencies. Additionally, the continued and
unnecessarily prolonged emission of sound from audible alarm systems
to the surrounding community and the difficulties and delays
§ 17-1 MANORHAVEN CODE § 25-1
19:60
§ 25-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ALARM SYSTEM — Any alarm device which automatically dials to a central
station and uses a pretaped or prerecorded message to alert the police that
an emergency exists or that the services of that department or of the Fire
Department are needed. "Alarm system" shall also mean any alarm device
which automatically emits an audible, visual or other response upon the
occurrence of any hazard or emergency and is intended to alert persons
outside the building to the existence of said hazard or emergency. The term
shall also include the fire alarms for the purposes of this chapter, but does
not include alarm signals transmitted to privately operated central stations.
CENTRAL STATION — Any company that is licensed and has submitted
an application to the local police; has been approved to install emergency
alarm devices and monitor pretaped or prerecorded messages; and who will
notify the Fire or Police Department that an emergency exists at a specific
location.
DIAL ALARM or DIALING DEVICE — Any fire or police alarm device which
is a telephone device or telephone attachment which automatically or
electronically selects a telephone line connected to a central station and
reproduces a prerecorded message to report a criminal act or other
emergency requiring Police or Fire Department response.
encountered in silencing such systems have disturbed the rest and
repose of residents of the village and have caused police, fire and
village personnel to spend excessive amounts of time both in the
investigation of those alarms and in the attempted silencing of them,
thereby preventing the devotion of time to the protection and general
welfare of the inhabitants of the village.
B. It is necessary to the general welfare, peace and repose of the village to
protect its residents through the establishment of controls of various
types of fire, intrusion, holdup and other emergency signals from fire
and police alarm devices which require Fire Department or Police
Department response, investigation or safeguarding of property at the
location of an event reported by a signal transmitted by telephone or
radio or otherwise relayed to the Police Department or the Fire
Department by an alarm device requiring investigation or other action
by any person acting in response to a signal activated by any alarm
device.
C. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to improve the availability of
police and fire equipment and personnel for the handling of emergency
situations and to reduce the number of false alarms. It is hereby
declared that the noise emanating from audible alarms which continue
to sound either without the existence of an emergency situation or after
the emergency situation has ended constitutes a public nuisance.
§ 25-1 ALARMS, SILENT § 25-2
25:61
FALSE EMERGENCY ALARM — Any signal actuated by an emergency alarm
to which the Police or Fire Department responds which is not the result of a
fire, holdup, robbery or other crime or emergency.

the Police Department as a telephone number through which members of
the public may report an emergency or request public assistance.
VILLAGE — The Incorporated Village of Manorhaven.

means, initiate the dialing, calling or other connection with any emergency
number other than the designated alarm company central station.
§ 25-4. Limitations on dialing devices.
No person shall use, operate or install any dialing device that will, upon
activation, automatically dial, call or connect with the telephone number
designated for the purpose of receiving such alarm messages, more than
twice for any one incident. Any system installed on or after the effective
date of this chapter must comply with this section. Preexisting installations
must comply within six months of the effective date of this chapter.
§ 25-5. Delay.
Upon the activation of a burglary (break-in) alarm, there shall be a
mandatory delay of at least 15 seconds before the transmission of a signal
to the alarm company central station to enable the user to abort the signal
in the event that it was triggered inadvertently. This delay shall not be
applicable to a robbery (hold-up), fire or medical emergency alarm. Any
system installed on or after the effective date of this chapter must comply
with this section. Preexisting installations must comply within six months of
the effective date of this chapter.
§ 25-6. Timing device.
The user of every alarm system emitting an audible, visual or other response
shall, at the time such system is installed, or within six months of the
effective date of this chapter in the case of existing systems, install or cause
to be installed an automatic timing device which shall deactivate such alarm
so that it will be activated for no more than 20 minutes.

ARTICLE I
Consumption in Public
[Adopted 7-24-1985 by L.L. No. 3-19855]
§ 26-1. Legislative intent.
It is the purpose of this article to protect the public interest, welfare,
health and safety within the Village of Manorhaven by prohibiting the
consumption of alcoholic beverages in public places within the village. The
Village Board finds that possession of an open or unsealed container of
alcoholic beverage in a public place within the village leads to consumption
of the same, resulting in public intoxication, disorderly conduct, disturbance
of the public peace, littering of the public places and destruction of
property. The Village Board finds further that preservation of the public
health and prevention of conditions which lead to conduct disturbing the
public peace attributable to consumption of alcoholic beverages can be
accomplished by the prohibition of consumption of alcoholic beverages in
public places and by restricting the possession of an open or unsealed
container of alcoholic beverages under circumstances which indicate that
the possessor of such open or unsealed container in a public place intends
to consume the same or intends to have it consumed by another person.

This chapter shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the State of
New York and the Village of Manorhaven for the protection of the economic

health of the Village of Manorhaven. The unrestricted establishment of
commercial game rooms and arcades would pose substantial hazards to the
peace, comfort, health, safety and welfare of the village residents. Likewise,
the unregulated proliferation of games and other amusement devices as
incidental uses within established business premises would pose equally
serious problems in the maintenance of an orderly and peaceful flow of

promotion of legitimate and necessary uses within the business community.

or otherwise.

computerized, electronic or other device, machine or implement which

electronic games, skill boards, billiard or pool tables, electronic bowling or
shuffleboard tables, bowling alleys and casino-type games.

health, peace, safety, comfort and welfare, including but not limited to

Zoning — See Ch. 155.
§ 29-1. Legislative intent.
A. Purpose and policy. It is the purpose of this chapter to preserve and
promote the character, appearance and aesthetics of the village by
providing procedures for architectural review of real property within
the village, including, without limitation, the exterior of new
construction, gates, entrance piers, fences, alterations, landscaping
(except routine maintenance), lighting and screening, signs, site
development, design or construction changes relating to structural
profile, elevation, footprint, previously submitted plan or permit,
whether issued or pending, and by requiring architectural permits for
same, to achieve the following:
(1) Encourage good qualities of building design and site development,
and relate such design and appearances to the sites and
surrounding of the structures.
(2) Preserve the prevailing aesthetic character of the neighborhood
and countryside and maintain the same by means of
complementary structures and site enhancements, placing
particular emphasis on the historic nautical character of the
village.
(3) Permit and encourage originality and resourcefulness in building
design, landscaping, screening and appearances, which are
appropriate to the sites and surroundings.
(4) Promote and encourage good qualities of architectural design and
utilization of land in the erection and construction of new
structures and the exterior, refurbishing, reconstruction or
alteration of existing structures.
(5) Assure that the design and the location of any proposed structure,
or the addition, alteration or reconstruction of any existing
structure, is in harmony with the existing topography of its site
and/or the existing structure as well as the neighboring
countryside and existing property.
§ 28-11 MANORHAVEN CODE § 29-1
29:74
§ 29-2. Architectural Review Board established.
(6) Discourage and prevent such design that would adversely affect or
cause the diminution in value of neighboring property, whether
improved or unimproved.
(7) Prevent such design and appearances as are unnecessarily
offensive to visual sensibilities, which impair the use, enjoyment,
value or desirability of neighboring properties and the health,
safety and general welfare of the community at large.
B. Legislative findings. The Board of Trustees hereby finds that:
(1) Structures that are visually offensive or inappropriate by reason of
poor exterior design, monotonous similarity or striking visual
discord or dissimilarity in relation to their site or surroundings mar
the appearances of their areas and adversely affect the desirability
of the immediate area and the neighboring area.
(2) Such structures discourage and prevent the most appropriate
development and utilization of land throughout the village.
(3) Such structures impair the use, enjoyment, desirability and
stability of improved and unimproved property and are detrimental
to the character of neighborhoods, produce a degeneration of the
values of real property with attendant deterioration of conditions
affecting the functioning, economic stability, prosperity, health,
safety and morals of inhabitants of the village and undermine the
proper relationship between the taxable value of real property and
the cost of municipal services provided therefor.
C. Legislative purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to prevent these
and other harmful effects and thus to promote the health, safety, morals
and general welfare of the community.

constructed, erected, reconstructed or altered in accordance with the
submitted plan, would be in harmony with the purpose of this chapter,
would not be visually offensive or inappropriate by reason of poor
quality of exterior design, monotonous similarity or striking visual

natural features of the site and surroundings, the community's
maritime character, exterior design and appearances of existing
structures and topography, screening from roadways and the character
of the neighborhood and its peculiar suitability for particular purposes,
with a view to conserving the values of property and encouraging the
most appropriate use of land.
C. In approving an application, the Board may impose appropriate
conditions and safeguards designed to prevent the harmful effects set
forth herein and may prescribe such appropriate conditions and

§ 72-1. Findings; purpose; objectives.
A. Findings. The Board of Trustees of the Incorporated Village of
Manorhaven finds that the potential and/or actual damages from
flooding and erosion may be a problem to the residents of the of the
Incorporated Village of Manorhaven and that such damages may
include destruction or loss of private and public housing, damage to
public facilities, both publicly and privately owned, and injury to and
loss of human life. In order to minimize the threat of such damages and
to achieve the purposes and objectives hereinafter set forth, this
chapter is adopted.
B. Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
(1) Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property
due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of floodwaters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase erosion or flood damages;
(5) Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally
divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
(6) Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
C. Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are to:
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD — The land in the floodplain within
a community subject to a one-percent-or-greater chance of flooding in any
given year. This area may be designated as Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-A30,
A99, V, VO, VE, or V1-V30. It is also commonly referred to as the base
floodplain or one-hundred-year floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the

have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated
floor, elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts
and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water and adequately
anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during
a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones
A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or D, "elevated building" also includes
a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with
openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters.

B.
A. Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas
of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Incorporated
Village of Manorhaven, Nassau County.
B. Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
(1) The areas of special flood hazard for the Incorporated Village of
Manorhaven, Community Number 360479, are identified and
defined on the following documents prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency:
(a) Flood Insurance Rate Map Panel Numbers: 36059C0101G,
36059C0102H, 36059C0103G, 36059C0104G, whose effective
date is September 11, 2009, and any subsequent revisions to
these map panels that do not affect areas under our
community's jurisdiction.
(b) A scientific and engineering report entitled "Flood Insurance
Study, Nassau County, New York, All Jurisdictions" dated
September 11, 2009.
(2) The above documents are hereby adopted and declared to be a part
of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study and/or maps are on file
at: the Village Hall, 33 Manorhaven Boulevard, Port Washington,
New York 11050.
C. Interpretation and conflict with other laws.
§ 72-2 (RESERVED) § 72-3
69:147
§ 72-4. Administration.
(1) This chapter includes all revisions to the National Flood Insurance
Program through October 27, 1997, and shall supersede all
previous laws adopted for the purpose of flood damage prevention.
(2) In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare. Whenever the
requirements of this chapter are at variance with the requirements
of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, or ordinances, the
most restrictive, or that imposing the higher standards, shall
govern.
D. Severability. The invalidity of any section or provision of this chapter
shall not invalidate any other section or provision thereof.
E. Penalties for noncompliance. No structure in an area of special flood
hazard shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or
altered and no land shall be excavated or filled without full compliance
with the terms of this chapter and any other applicable regulations. Any
infraction of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any
of its requirements, including infractions of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with conditions of the permit, shall constitute
a violation. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined no more
than $250 or imprisoned for not more than 15 days or both. Each day of
noncompliance shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the Incorporated Village of Manorhaven from
taking such other lawful action as necessary to prevent or remedy an
infraction. Any structure found not compliant with the requirements of
this chapter for which the developer and/or owner has not applied for
and received an approved variance under § 72-6 will be declared
noncompliant and notification sent to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
F. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.
Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may
be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the area of special flood hazards or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the
Incorporated Village of Manorhaven, any officer or employee thereof, or
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.

administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following.
(1) Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(a) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 72-4C Application for a permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(b) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If
a proposed building site is located in an area of special flood
hazard, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall meet the applicable standards of § 72-5, Construction
standards and, in particular, § 72-5A(2), Subdivision proposals.
(c) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of
special flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other
property (e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood
velocities). The local administrator may require the applicant
to submit additional technical analyses and data necessary to
complete the determination. If the proposed development may
result in physical damage to any other property or fails to meet
the requirements of § 72-5, Construction standards, no permit
shall be issued. The applicant may revise the application to
include measures that mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects
and resubmit the application.
(d) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required
by state or federal law.
(2) Use of other flood data.
(a) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has
designated areas of special flood hazard on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced
water surface elevation data (These areas are designated Zone
A or V on the FIRM.) nor identified a floodway, the local
administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state or other source, including data developed
§ 72-4 (RESERVED) § 72-4
69:151
pursuant to § 72-4C(7), as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(b) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the
purposes of this chapter.
(3) Alteration of watercourses.
(a) Notification to adjacent communities and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting
any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submittal of
evidence of such notification to the Regional Director, Region
II, Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(b) Determine that the permit holder has provided for
maintenance within the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not
diminished.
(4) Construction stage.
(a) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor
or completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially
improved structure, obtain from the permit holder a
certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or
floodproofed elevation, in relation to mean sea level. The
certificate shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision
of a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer and
certified by same. For manufactured homes, the permit holder
shall submit the certificate of elevation upon placement of the
structure on the site. A certificate of elevation must also be
submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a site for
180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed and
ready for highway use).
(b) In Zones V1-V30 and VE, and also Zone V if base flood elevation
data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor of a new
or substantially improved structure, the permit holder shall
submit to the local administrator a certificate of elevation, in
relation to mean sea level, of the bottom of the lowest
structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and
columns). The certificate shall be prepared by or under the
direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or professional
engineer and certified by same. For manufactured homes, the
permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation upon
placement of the structure on the site. An elevation certificate
must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains
§ 72-4 MANORHAVEN CODE § 72-4
69:152
on a site 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully
licensed and ready for highway use).
(c) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval
of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies
detected shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project unless immediately corrected.
(5) Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's
engineer or architect shall make periodic inspections at
appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order to
monitor compliance with permit conditions and enable said
inspector to certify, if requested, that the development is in
compliance with the requirements of the floodplain development
permit and/or any variance provisions.
(6) Stop-work orders.
(a) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a
stop-work order for any floodplain development found ongoing
without a development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order
shall subject the violator to the penalties described in § 72-3E
of this chapter.
(b) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a
stop-work order for any floodplain development found
noncompliant with the provisions of this chapter and/or the
conditions of the development permit. Disregard of a stop-work
order shall subject the violator to the penalties described in
§ 72-3E of this chapter.
(7) Certificate of compliance.21
(a) In areas of special flood hazard, as determined by documents
enumerated in § 72-3B, it shall be unlawful to occupy or to
permit the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or
both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed,
converted or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use or
structure until a certificate of compliance has been issued by
the local administrator stating that the building or land

the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously during
the base flood on all building components.
(a) The structural design shall be adequate to resist water forces
that would occur during the base flood. Horizontal water loads
considered shall include inertial and drag forces of waves,
current drag forces, and impact forces from waterborne storm
debris. Dynamic uplift loads shall also be considered if
bulkheads, walls, or other natural or man-made flow
obstructions could cause wave runup beyond the elevation of
the base flood.
(b) Buildings shall be designed and constructed to resist the forces
due to wind pressure. Wind forces on the superstructure
include windward and leeward forces on vertical walls, uplift
on the roof, internal forces when openings allow wind to enter
the house, and upward force on the underside of the house
when it is exposed. In the design, the wind should be assumed
to blow potentially from any lateral direction relative to the
house.
§ 72-5 MANORHAVEN CODE § 72-5
69:158
(c) Wind loading values used shall be those required by the
building code.
(3) Foundation standards.
(a) The pilings or column foundation and structure attached
thereto shall be adequately anchored to resist flotation,
collapse or lateral movement due to the effects of wind and
water pressures acting simultaneously on all building
components. Foundations must be designed to transfer safely
to the underlying soil all loads due to wind, water, dead load,
live load and other loads (including uplift due to wind and
water).
(b) Spread footings and fill material shall not be used for
structural support of a new building or substantial
improvement of an existing structure.
(4) Pile foundation design.
(a) The design ratio of pile spacing to pile diameter shall not be
less than 8:1 for individual piles. (This shall not apply to pile
clusters located below the design grade). The maximum
center-to-center spacing of wood piles shall not be more than
12 feet on center under load-bearing sills, beams, or girders.
(b) Pilings shall have adequate soil penetration (bearing capacity)
to resist the combined wave and wind loads (lateral and uplift)
associated with the base flood acting simultaneously with
typical structure (live and dead) loads, and shall include
consideration of decreased resistance capacity caused by
erosion of soil strata surrounding the piles. The minimum
penetration for foundation piles is to an elevation of five feet
below mean sea level (msl) datum if the BFE is +10 msl or less,
or to be at least 10 feet below msl if the BFE is greater than
+10 msl.
(c) Pile foundation analysis shall also include consideration of
piles in column action from the bottom of the structure to the
stable soil elevation of the site. Pilings may be horizontally or
diagonally braced to withstand wind and water forces.
(d) The minimum acceptable sizes for timber piles are a tip
diameter of eight inches for round timber piles and eight
inches by eight inches for square timber piles. All wood piles
must be treated in accordance with requirements of EPEE-C3
to minimize decay and damage from fungus.
(e) Reinforced concrete piles shall be cast of concrete having a
twenty-eight-day ultimate compressive strength of not less
than 5,000 pounds per square inch, and shall be reinforced
with a minimum of four longitudinal steel bars having a
§ 72-5 (RESERVED) § 72-5
69:159
combined area of not less than 1% nor more than 4% of the
gross concrete area. Reinforcing for precast piles shall have a
concrete cover of not less than 1 1/4 inches for No. 5 bars and
smaller and not less than 1 1/2 inches for No. 6 through No.
11 bars. Reinforcement for piles cast in the field shall have a
concrete cover of not less than two inches.
(f) Piles shall be driven by means of a pile driver or drop hammer,
jetted, or augered into place.
(g) Additional support for piles in the form of bracing may include
lateral or diagonal bracing between piles.
(h) When necessary, piles shall be braced at the ground line in
both directions by a wood timber grade beam or a reinforced
concrete grade beam. These at-grade supports should be
securely attached to the piles to provide support even if
scoured from beneath.
(i) Diagonal bracing between piles, consisting of two-inch-byeight-
inch (minimum) members bolted to the piles, shall be
limited in location to below the lowest supporting structural
member and above the stable soil elevation, and aligned in the
vertical plane along pile rows perpendicular to the shoreline.
Galvanized steel rods (minimum diameter 1/2 inch) or cabletype
bracing is permitted in any plane.
(j) Knee braces, which stiffen both the upper portion of a pile and
the beam-to-pile connection, may be used along pile rows
perpendicular and parallel to the shoreline. Knee braces shall
be two-by-eight lumber bolted to the sides of the pile/beam, or
four-by-four or larger braces framed into the pile/beam.
Bolting shall consist of two 5/8 inch galvanized steel bolts
(each end) for two-by-eight members, or one 5/8 inch lag bolt
(each end) for square members. Knee braces shall not extend
more than three feet below the elevation of the base flood.
(5) Column foundation design. Masonry piers or poured-in-place
concrete piers shall be internally reinforced to resist vertical and
lateral loads, and be connected with a movement-resisting
connection to a pile cap or pile shaft.
(6) Connectors and fasteners. Galvanized metal connectors, wood
connectors, or bolts of size and number adequate for the calculated
loads must be used to connect adjoining components of a structure.
Toe nailing as a principal method of connection is not permitted. All
metal connectors and fasteners used in exposed locations shall be
steel, hot-dipped galvanized after fabrication. Connectors in
protected interior locations shall be fabricated from galvanized
sheet.
§ 72-5 MANORHAVEN CODE § 72-5
69:160
(7) Beam-to-pile connections. The primary floor beams or girders shall
span the supports in the direction parallel to the flow of potential
floodwater and wave action and shall be fastened to the columns or
pilings by bolting, with or without cover plates. Concrete members
shall be connected by reinforcement, if cast in place, or (of precast)
shall be securely connected by bolting and welding. If sills, beams,
or girders are attached to wood piling at a notch, a minimum of two
5/8 inch galvanized steel bolts or two hot-dipped galvanized straps
3/16 inch by four inches by 18 inches each bolted with two 1/2 inch
lag bolts per beam member shall be used. Notching of pile tops
shall be the minimum sufficient to provide ledge support for beam
members without unduly weakening pile connections. Piling shall
not be notched so that the cross section is reduced below 50%.
(8) Floor and deck connections.
(a) Wood two-inch-by-four-inch (minimum) connectors or metal
joist anchors shall be used to tie floor joists to floor beams/
girders. These should be installed on alternate floor joists, at a
minimum. Cross bridging of all floor joists shall be provided.
Such cross bridging may be one-inch-by-three-inch members,
placed eight feet on-center maximum, or solid bridging of same
depth as joist at same spacing.
(b) Plywood should be used for subflooring and attic flooring to
provide good torsional resistance in the horizontal plane of the
structure. The plywood should not be less than 3/4 inch total
thickness, and should be exterior grade and fastened to beams
or joists with 8d annular or spiral thread galvanized nails. Such
fastening shall be supplemented by the application of
waterproof industrial adhesive applied to all bearing surfaces.
(9) Exterior wall connections. All bottom plates shall have any required
breaks under a wall stud or an anchor bolt. Approved anchors will
be used to secure rafters or joists and top and bottom plates to
studs in exterior and bearing walls to form a continuous tie.
Continuous 15/32 inch or thicker plywood sheathing, overlapping
the top wall plate and continuing down to the sill, beam, or girder,
may be used to provide the continuous tie. If the sheets of plywood
are not vertically continuous, then two-by-four nailer blocking shall
be provided at all horizontal joints. In lieu of the plywood,
galvanized steel rods of 1/2 inch diameter or galvanized steel
straps not less than one inch wide by 1/16 inch thick may be used to
connect from the top wall plate to the sill, beam, or girder. Washers
with a minimum diameter of three inches shall be used at each end
of the 1/2 inch round rods. These anchors shall be installed no more
than two feet from each corner rod, no more than four feet on
center.
(10) Ceiling joist/rafter connections.
§ 72-5 (RESERVED) § 72-5
69:161
(a) All ceiling joists or rafters shall be installed in such a manner
that the joists provide a continuous tie across the rafters.
Ceiling joists and rafters shall be securely fastened at their
intersections. A metal or wood connector shall be used at
alternate ceiling joist/rafter connections to the wall top plate.
(b) Gable roofs shall be additionally stabilized by installing two-byfour
blocking on two-foot centers between the rafters at each
gable end. Blocking shall be installed a minimum of eight feet
toward the house interior from each gable end.
(11) Projecting members. All cantilevers and other projecting members
must be adequately supported and braced to withstand wind and
water uplift forces. Roof eave overhangs shall be limited to a
maximum of two feet and joist overhangs to a maximum of one foot.
Larger overhangs and porches will be permitted if designed or
reviewed and certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
(12) Roof sheathing.
(a) Plywood, or other wood material, when used as roof sheathing,
shall not be less than 15/32 inch in thickness, and shall be of
exterior sheathing grade or equivalent. All attaching devices
for sheathing and roof coverings shall be galvanized or be of
other suitable corrosion resistant material.
(b) All corners, gable ends, and roof overhangs exceeding six
inches shall be reinforced by the application of waterproof
industrial adhesive applied to all bearing surfaces of any
plywood sheet used in the sheathing of such corner, gable end,
or roof overhang.
(c) In addition, roofs should be sloped as steeply as practicable to
reduce uplift pressures, and special care should be used in
securing ridges, hips, valleys, eaves, vents, chimneys, and
other points of discontinuity in the roofing surface.
(13) Protection of openings. All exterior glass panels, windows, and
doors shall be designed, detailed, and constructed to withstand
loads due to the design wind speed of 75 miles per hour.
Connections for these elements must be designed to transfer safely
the design loads to the supporting structure. Panel widths of
multiple panel sliding glass doors shall not exceed three feet.
(14) Breakaway wall design standards.
(a) The breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance
of not less than 10 and not more than 20 pounds per square
foot, with the criterion that the safety of the overall structure
at the point of wall failure be confirmed using established
procedures. Grade beams shall be installed in both directions
§ 72-5 MANORHAVEN CODE § 72-5
69:162
for all piles considered to carry the breakaway wall load. Knee
braces are required for front row piles that support breakaway
walls.
(b) Use of breakaway wall strengths in excess of 20 pounds per
square foot shall not be permitted unless a registered
professional engineer or architect has developed or reviewed
the structural design and specifications for the building
foundation and breakaway wall components, and certifies that
the breakaway walls will fail under water loads less than those
that would occur during the base flood; and the elevated
portion of the building and supporting foundation system will
not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural
damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting
simultaneously on all building components (structural and
nonstructural). Water loading values used shall be those
associated with the base flood. Wind loading values shall be
those required by the building code.
E. Nonresidential structures (except coastal high-hazard areas). The
following standards apply to new and substantially improved
commercial, industrial and other nonresidential structures located in
areas of special flood hazard, in addition to the requirements in
§ 72-5A(2), Subdivision proposals, and § 72-5A(3), Encroachments, and

result.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(6) Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification
of:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
(7) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from lowest floor elevation.

substandard with respect to structure, equipment or maintenance, and,
further, that such conditions, together with inadequate provision for light
and air, insufficient protection against fire hazards, lack of proper heating,
unsanitary conditions and overcrowding, constitute a menace or nuisance
to the health, safety, morals, welfare and reasonable comfort of its citizens.
It is further found and declared that the existence of such conditions,
factors or characteristics will, if not remedied, create slum and blighted
areas requiring large-scale clearance, and, further, that in the absence of
corrective measures, such areas will experience a deterioration of social
values, a curtailment of investment and tax revenue and an impairment of
economic values. It is further found and declared that the establishment and
maintenance of minimum housing standards is essential to the prevention
blight and decay and the safeguarding of public health, safety, morals and
welfare.

§ 128-1. Purpose. [Amended 3-28-2007 by L.L. No. 2-2007]
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing within this
jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in § 128-1.1 hereof. This
chapter seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives:
A. Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the SPDES
General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate
§ 125-4 SOIL EROSION § 128-1
128:315
§ 128-1.1. Findings of fact. [Added 3-28-2007 by L.L. No. 2-2007]
It is hereby determined that:
Stormwater Sewer Systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-02-02, or as
amended or revised;
B. Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation
State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) General Permit
for Construction Activities GP-02-01, or as amended or revised;
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
D. Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land
development activities which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
E. Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to the
maximum extent practicable; and
F. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
practices and to ensure that these management practices are properly
maintained and eliminate threats to public safety.
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and
other desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the municipality;

§ 128-4. Additional standards for certain uses.
except marine biodegradable cleansers, into municipal streets,
catch basins or waterways is prohibited.
A. The use of hard structural erosion protective measures for control of
erosion are generally accepted practices in a Maritime Center and are
specifically appropriate in the following circumstances: vegetative
approaches to controlling erosion are not effective; enhancement of
natural protective features would not be practical in providing
protection; and construction of a hard structure is the only practical
design consideration and is essential to protecting a water-dependent
use. When hard structural erosion protective measures are used, they
shall be limited to the minimum scale necessary and be based on sound
engineering practices. Practical vegetative methods shall be included in
the project design and implementation.
B. Standards.
(1) Proposed erosion protection structures shall be designed with at
least a thirty-year design life and conform to generally accepted
engineering principles in both design and construction. All
materials used in erosion protective structures shall be durable and
capable of withstanding wave impacts, ice movement, weathering
and other effects of storm conditions for the anticipated thirty-year
life of the structure or be replaced as necessary.
(2) A long-term maintenance program shall be provided, which
includes specifications for normal maintenance of degradable
materials and the periodic replacement of removable materials.
(3) The design and siting of erosion control structures shall be of the
minimum scale necessary and shall include sea level rise
calculations.
(4) Erosion protective structures shall be compatible in appearance
with erosion protective structures on adjacent lots.
(5) Erosion protective structures shall not cause measurable increases
in erosion at the development site or other locations; and shall
minimize and, if possible, prevent adverse effects to natural
protective features, existing erosion protection structures and
natural resources such as significant fish and wildlife habitats.
A. Commercial and industrial uses.
(1) Access drives of commercial or industrial uses shall be finished
with a surface that will minimize stormwater runoff and dust and
debris.
§ 128-2 MANORHAVEN CODE § 128-4
128:322
(2) Paving of an existing permeable, semipermeable or porous area
(including but not limited to gravel, sand, cement strip and
engineered block) with an impermeable material (including but not
limited to cement, asphalt, macadam) shall require a permit from
the Village Building Department. Stormwater runoff must be
contained on site and not impact upon municipal streets or
waterways. If the proposed paving is within 300 feet of a waterway,
the Building Department may require review by the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation and the Planning
Board.
B. Marina and waterside uses.
(1) These regulations shall apply to any marina and waterside uses,
including but not limited to yacht clubs, boat yards, other boating
facilities and water-dependent aviation.

(design, construction and operation), best management
practices will be implemented to protect and safeguard the
natural resources and ensure the environmental integrity of
the impacted area.
(b) Marinas/structures shall be designed to minimize adverse
environmental impact and provide appropriate mitigation for
such impacts.
(c) All structures shall only be composed of materials which will
have minimal adverse effect on the environment or water
quality.
(2) General design criteria.
(a) All structures shall be constructed in accordance with
generally accepted engineering and design standards and
prevent flooding and erosion hazards.
(b) Sufficient land area to support the water-based activities shall
be provided, i.e., parking, security facilities, storage and
related building structures and patron services.
(c) Access from uplands through vegetated wetlands to reach
open water shall be above the wetlands on piers of sufficient
height to allow light penetration to vegetation.
(d) In-water or maintenance dredging shall take place at a time
designated by the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation to minimize adverse impacts on
living marine resources.
(e) Any structure within a waterway utilized in connection with an
adjacent use shall not exceed the support capacity of the
upland facilities.
§ 128-4 SOIL EROSION § 128-4
128:323
(f) Basins and channels shall be no deeper than the parent body of
water.
(g) Currents or tidal flow shall not be impeded or restricted to
allow for adequate flushing.
(3) Stormwater runoff/sewage-sanitation.
(a) Marinas shall be designed with as much porous land surface
and vegetative cover as possible to prevent stormwater runoff
and contaminated waters from reaching adjacent coastal
waters and wetlands.
(b) Buffer zones of natural vegetation shall be established between
the proposed development and any waterways and wetlands.
Where possible, existing shoreline vegetation shall remain
undisturbed and thus available to function as natural shoreline
protection.
(c) Berms and grassed swales shall be made part of the marina
design so that there is a gradient slope away (inland) from the
edge of the basin. If necessary, stormwater runoff retention
basins should be utilized to prevent pollution and
contamination of adjacent wetlands and coastal waters.
(d) All marina development and pump-out facilities shall be tied to
a central wastewater treatment facility.
(e) All marinas serving boats with an inboard sanitation device or
a full or semienclosed cabin shall include facilities for the
adequate and proper pump out and handling of sanitary
wastes, petroleum products, boat maintenance and repair
wastes, litter and other refuse, and for efficient treatment of
stormwater runoff. A log of sanitary waste pump out and
disposal shall be maintained for inspection by the Village
Building Department. The village may require dye pellets or
similar measures to determine compliance with sanitary waste
disposal regulations.
(4) Docks; piers; bulkheads; shoreline stabilization.
(a) In any case where shoreline stabilization is necessary,
consideration will first be given to vegetative or other
nonstructural means. Any stabilization measure shall be
consistent with the soil erosion standards61 and the standards
for erosion protection structures.62
(b) For marine commercial or marine recreational uses, piers are
preferred to dredging as a means of reaching deep waters.

water from individual residential car washing, natural riparian
habitat or wetland flows, dechlorinated swimming pool discharges,
residential street wash water, water from fire-fighting activities,
and any other water source not containing pollutants. Such exempt
discharges shall be made in accordance with an appropriate plan
for reducing pollutants.
(2) Discharges approved in writing by the SMO to protect life or
property from imminent harm or damage, provided that such
approval shall not be construed to constitute compliance with other
applicable laws and requirements, and further provided that such
discharges may be permitted for a specified time period and under
such conditions as the SMO may deem appropriate to protect such
life and property while reasonably maintaining the purpose and
intent of this article.
(3) Dye testing in compliance with applicable state and local laws is an
allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the SMO
prior to the time of the test.
(4) The prohibition shall not apply to any discharge permitted under an
SPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the
Department, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with
all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other
applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written
approval has been granted for any discharge to the MS4.
B. Prohibition of illicit connections.
(1) The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the MS4 is prohibited.
(2) This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection
was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at
the time of connection.
(3) A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the municipality's MS4 or
allows such a connection to continue.
§ 130-5 STORM SEWERS § 130-6
130:335
§ 130-6. Activities contaminating stormwater prohibited.
§ 130-7. Prevention, control, and reduction of stormwater
pollutants by use of best management practices.
§ 130-8. Suspension of access to MS4.
A. Activities that are subject to the requirements of this section are those
types of activities that:
(1) Cause or contribute to a violation of the municipality's MS4 SPDES
permit.
(2) Cause or contribute to the municipality being subject to the special
conditions as defined in § 130-2, Definitions, of this article.
B. Upon notification to a person that he or she is engaged in activities that
cause or contribute to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES
permit authorization, that person shall take all reasonable actions to
correct such activities such that he or she no longer causes or
contributes to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES permit
authorization.
A. Best management practices. Where the SMO has identified illicit
discharges as defined in § 130-2 or activities contaminating stormwater
as defined in § 130-6, the municipality may require implementation of
best management practices (BMPs) to control those illicit discharges
and activities.
(1) The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable protection
from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the MS4 through the use of structural and nonstructural
BMPs.
(2) Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge as defined in § 130-2 or an
activity contaminating stormwater as defined in § 130-6, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional
structural and nonstructural BMPs to reduce or eliminate the
source of pollutant(s) to the MS4.
(3) Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with
the provisions of this section.
A. Illicit discharges in emergency situations. The SMO may, without prior
notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4. The
§ 130-6 MANORHAVEN CODE § 130-8
130:336
§ 130-9. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the municipality prior to the allowing of discharges to the
MS4.
§ 130-10. Applicability; access to facilities; monitoring of
discharges.
SMO shall notify the person of such suspension within a reasonable
time thereafter in writing of the reasons for the suspension. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the SMO may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the municipality's MS4 in violation of this article may
have his or her MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator in writing
of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its
recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines in writing
that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the
SMO.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this article, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,
or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which
constitutes a violation of this article.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security
measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records as may be required to implement this
article.
§ 130-8 STORM SEWERS § 130-10
130:337
§ 130-11. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the municipality in person or by
telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed
and mailed to the municipality within three business days of the telephone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial
or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment
shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions
taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least
three years.
(3) The municipality shall have the right to set up on any facility
subject to this article such devices as are necessary in the opinion
of the SMO to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
stormwater discharge.
(4) The municipality has the right to require the facilities subject to
this article to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably
necessary to determine compliance with this article. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at
its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the municipality access to a
facility subject to this article is a violation of this article. A person
who is the operator of a facility subject to this article commits an
offense if the person denies the municipality reasonable access to
the facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this article.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 130-10 MANORHAVEN CODE § 130-12
130:338
§ 130-12. Enforcement; penalties for offenses.
§ 130-13. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of
the SMO to the Village Board of Trustees within 15 days of its issuance,
A. Notice of violation.
(1) When the municipality's SMO finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, he/she
may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
(a) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(b) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease
and desist;
(c) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
(d) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(e) Payment of a fine; and
(f) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
(2) If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
B. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this article
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not $350 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense, both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a
fine not less than $350 nor more than $700 or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed six months, or both; and upon conviction for a third
or subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a period of
five years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than $1,000
or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both.
However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and
judicial officers generally, violations of this article shall be deemed
misdemeanors and for such purpose only all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
§ 130-12 STORM SEWERS § 130-13
130:339
which shall hear the appeal within 30 days after the filing of the appeal,
and within five days of making its decision, file its decision in the office of
the municipal clerk and mail a copy of its decision by certified mail to the
discharger.
§ 130-14. Corrective measures after appeal.
§ 130-15. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this article. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this article, the SMO may petition for
a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities
which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform
abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 130-16. Alternative remedies.
A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within five
business days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the
decision of the SMO, then the SMO shall request the owner's
permission for access to the subject private property to take any and all
measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore
the property.
B. If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek a
warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter
upon the property to determine whether a violation has occurred. Upon
determination that a violation has occurred, the SMO may seek a court
order to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property. The cost of implementing and
maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the
discharger.
A. Where a person has violated a provision of this article, he/she may be
eligible for alternative remedies in lieu of a civil penalty, upon
recommendation of the Municipal Attorney and concurrence of the
Municipal Code Enforcement Officer, where:
(1) The violation was unintentional.
(2) The violator has no history of previous violations of this article.
(3) Environmental damage was minimal.

condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of
this article is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared
and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at
the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise
compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
§ 130-18. Remedies not exclusive.
The remedies listed in this article are not exclusive of any other remedies
available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within
the discretion of the authorized enforcement agency to seek cumulative
remedies.
§ 130-19. When effective; conflict with other provisions.
This article shall be in full force and effect immediately upon filing with the
Secretary of State. Where prior local laws and parts thereof are in conflict
with this article, this article shall supersede.

§ 133-3. Procedure for minor subdivision.
F. If required improvements and utilities have not been completed under
the inspection and to the satisfaction of the Board prior to final approval

accordance with the form supplied by the Board, to secure to the village
the actual construction and installation of such improvements required
by the Board on such final approval and at a time fixed by the Board and
in accordance with the requirements of the Board under these
regulations. As to utilities required by the Board on such final approval,
the Board may, in its sole discretion, accept assurance in writing from

installed. When such writing is acceptable, it shall be addressed to the
Board and state in substance or effect that such public utility company
will make the installations necessary for the furnishing of its services
within the time therein specified and as satisfactory to the Board. There
may also be included in determining the amount of such bond the
reasonable cost of inspection of such improvements by the Board, the
estimated cost of employing a watchman to guard any stormwater
drainage or storage basins required to be installed by the Board, the
cost of liability insurance and the estimated cost of installation of
necessary water supply facilities. There shall be further included in said

village in the enforcement of the bond and the completion of the public
improvements covered by the bond.

the Board and if the Board shall approve the plat, the approval of the
Board shall be endorsed thereon, together with the date thereof, over
the signature of the Mayor of the Incorporated Village of Manorhaven
or the Village Clerk or an alternate by resolution of the Board. Prior to

development simultaneously with the approval of a plat or plats in an
R-3 Zoning District or where otherwise permitted under Chapter 155,
Zoning, of the Code of the Incorporated Village of Manorhaven.

building lots or dwelling units which could be permitted, in the Board's
judgment, if the land were subdivided into lots conforming to the
minimum lot size and density requirements of the underlying zoning
district in which such land is situated and conforming to all other
applicable requirements; provided, however, that if the plat falls within
two or more contiguous districts, the Board may approve a cluster

all applicable laws and regulations, except where variation therefrom
may be specifically authorized by the Board.

cluster development layout, present at the office of the Incorporated
Village of Manorhaven, in duplicate, the complete application for the

§ 136-7. Business records.
Every utility subject to tax under this article shall keep such records of its
business and in such form as the Treasurer of the village may require, and
such records shall be preserved for a period of three years, except that the

§ 136-8. Filing of return.
§ 136-6 MANORHAVEN CODE § 136-8
136:392
§ 136-9. Payment upon filing.
At the time of filing a return as required by this article, each utility shall pay
to the Treasurer of the village the tax imposed by this article for the period
covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which
the return is required to be filed.
§ 136-10. Remedy for insufficient return.
A. Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file, on or before September
25, December 25, March 25 and June 25, a return for the three calendar
months preceding each such return date, including any period for
which the tax imposed hereby or by any amendment hereof is effective,
each of which returns shall state the gross income or gross operating
income for the period covered by each such return.
B. Returns shall be filed with the Treasurer of the village on a form to be
furnished by him for such purpose and shall contain such other data,
information or matter as the Treasurer of the village may require to be
included therein.
C. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, any utility
whose average gross income or average gross operating income, as the
case may be, for the aforesaid three months' period is less than $1,500,
may file a return annually on June 25 for the 12 preceding calendar
months, and the Treasurer of the village may require any utility to file
an annual return, which shall contain any data specified by him,
regardless of whether the utility is subject to tax under this article.
D. Every return shall have annexed thereto a certification by the head of
the utility making the same, or by the owner or a copartner thereof, or
by a principal officer of the corporation, if such business is conducted
by a corporation, to the effect that the statements contained therein are
true.
A. In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Treasurer of the village and if a corrected or
sufficient return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by
notice from him, or if no return is made for any period, the Treasurer of
the village shall determine the amount of tax due from such information
as he is able to obtain, and if necessary, may estimate the tax on the
basis of external indices or otherwise. He shall give notice of such
determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination
shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax unless the person against whom
it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving of notice of such
determination, apply to the Treasurer of the village for a hearing, or
unless the Treasurer of the village, of his own motion, shall reduce the
same. After such hearing, the Treasurer of the village shall give notice
of his decision to the person liable for the tax. Such decision may be
reviewed by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law of
§ 136-8 TAXATION § 136-10
136:393
§ 136-11. Service of notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this article, or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 136-12. Penalty for nonpayment.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax or
any portion thereof within the time required by this article shall be subject
to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax for each
month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after such
return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the Treasurer
of the village, for cause shown, may extend the time for filing any return,
and if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of
the penalty fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 136-13. Refunds.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer
thereof shall make application for a refund thereof and the Treasurer of
the village or the court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any
portion thereof was erroneously or illegally collected, the Treasurer of
the village shall refund the amount so determined. For like cause and
the State of New York if application therefor is made within 90 days
after the giving of notice of such decision. An order to review such
decision shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to
be reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first
deposited with the Treasurer of the village and an undertaking filed
with him, in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the
Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be
dismissed or the tax confirmed, the applicant will pay all costs and
charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding, or at
the option of the applicant, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient
to cover the tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in
which event the applicant shall not be required to pay such tax, interest
and penalties as a condition precedent to the granting of such order.
B. Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with intent to
evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the
expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a
return; provided, however, that where no return has been filed as
required by this article, the tax may be assessed at any time.
§ 136-10 MANORHAVEN CODE § 136-13
136:394
within the same period, a refund may be so made on the initiative of the
Treasurer of the village. However, no refund shall be made of a tax or
penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the Treasurer of the village as
hereinbefore provided, unless the Treasurer of the village, after a hearing
as hereinbefore provided, or of his own motion, shall have reduced the
tax or penalty or it shall have been established in a proceeding under
Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York
that such determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made
out of moneys collected under this article. An application for a refund,
made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for the
revision of any tax or penalty complained of, and the Treasurer of the
village may receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After making
his determination, the Treasurer of the village shall give notice thereof to
the person interested, and he shall be entitled to an order to review such
determination under said Article 78, subject to the provisions hereinbefore
contained relating to the granting of such an order.
§ 136-14. Liability for payment.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 136-15. Failure to pay tax.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
article, the Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the Treasurer of the
village, bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any
judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Treasurer of the
village. Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the
person liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent
that the tax and penalty imposed by § 143278 are made a lien.
§ 136-16. Powers and duties of Treasurer.
In the administration of this article, the Treasurer of the village shall have
power to make such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with
law, as may be necessary for the exercise of his powers and the performance
of his duties, and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other records
relating to the administration and enforcement of the tax, to take testimony
and proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter within the line of his
official duty under this article and to subpoena and require the attendance
of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents.

which events the court may require the production of and may admit in
evidence so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby as are
pertinent to the action or proceeding, and no more.
B. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person or
his duly authorized representative of a copy of any return filed by him,
nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent
the identification of particular returns and the items thereof, or the
publication of delinquent lists showing the names of persons who have
failed to pay their taxes at the time and in the manner provided for by
this article, together with any relevant information which, in the
opinion of the Treasurer of the village, may assist in the collection of
such delinquent taxes; nor to prohibit the inspection by the Village
Attorney or other legal representatives of the Village of Manorhaven of
the return of any person who shall bring action to set aside or review
the tax based thereon or against whom an action has been instituted in
accordance with the provisions of this article.

punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment not
exceeding one year, or both, and if the offender is an officer, agent,

vegetation are related to the natural, scenic, and aesthetic values and
the physical and visual qualities of the environment which the Village is
obligated to protect.

vegetation causes increased Village costs for proper drainage control,
impairs the benefits of occupancy of existing residential properties, and
impairs the stability and value of both improved and unimproved real
property in the area of the destruction and adversely affects the health,
safety, and general welfare of the residents of the Village.

The Board of Trustees of the Incorporated Village of Manorhaven hereby
finds that an emergency exists at any time that snow is permitted to
accumulate on the streets of the Village and that certain acts and omissions
of the inhabitants of the Village impede the removal of snow. It is further
found that such acts and omissions, by impeding the removal of snow from
the streets of the Village, also impede the provision of fire, police and
ambulance service to the residents of the Village and impede the provision
of other necessary services to Village residents. For the above reasons, said
Board of Trustees of the Incorporated Village of Manorhaven enacts the
following provisions.

two or where this is difficult or impossible to determine, it shall mean the
opposite side of the street from the odd side of the street.
ODD DAYS — Those days of the month whose dates are not evenly divisible
by two.
ODD SIDE OF THE STREET — That side of the street on which a majority of
the buildings bear street address numbers which are not divisible by two, or,
where this is difficult or impossible to determine, it shall mean the opposite
side of the street from the even side of the street.
STREET — Any street actually in existence within the Incorporated Village
of Manorhaven.
§ 147-25. Snow emergency regulations; when effective.
A. Declaration of snow emergency. In the event of an accumulation, or
forecasted accumulation, of snow or ice as would render vehicular

§ 151-1. Title.
This chapter shall be cited as the "Waterways Law of the Village of

Manhasset Bay is an important and intensely used area that supports a
wide range of public and private in-water uses, including recreational and
commercial boating, mooring areas, recreational fishing and swimming,
boat yards and marinas, and yacht and beach clubs. The Village of
Manorhaven finds that in accordance with the contents of the Local
Waterfront Revitalization Program and Harbor Master Plan, in order to
allocate and manage the safe and efficient use of the harbor and waters
and to allocate adequate space for these uses, the Code of the Village
of Manorhaven should be amended to implement a Waterways Law for
the Village of Manorhaven. This Waterways Law is an interim measure to
the completion of a Harbor Management Plan for all of Manhasset Bay
and will be reviewed upon completion of such plan by the Town of North
Hempstead, the Incorporated Village of Manorhaven and all other involved
municipalities and agencies. Mooring permits of any type granted under
this chapter shall not give the recipient any vested right or privilege or
preference when the Harbor Management Plan for all of Manhasset Bay
becomes effective, and shall expire upon the effective date of such Harbor
Management Plan.
§ 151-3. Authority.
This chapter is adopted pursuant to Article 42 of the Executive Law, § 46-a
of Article 4 of the Navigation Law, § 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law,
and Article 4 of the New York State Constitution.84
§ 151-4. Applicability; effect of other provisions.

following rules and regulations shall apply to all waters within the
Incorporated Village of Manorhaven and to all waters bounding the
village to a distance of 1,500 feet from the shore of the village, except
as limited by an Intermunicipal Agreement between the Town of North
Hempstead and the Village of Manorhaven.
84.Editor's Note: Section II of L.L. No. 4-1999 adopting this Ch. 151 stated as follows: "This
local law shall become effective upon receipt of any approvals which may be required
pursuant to § 46-a of the Navigation Law of the State of New York, and upon approval of
the Village's Local Waterfront Revitalization Program pursuant to Article 42 of the
Executive Law, and upon filing in the office of the Secretary of State."

imposed by Chapter 155, Zoning, or by any other portion of the Village
Code.
A. Mooring areas. The Waterways Committee will recommend the location
of mooring areas to be prescribed on the Mooring Plan where individual
vessels may be moored. No person shall moor any vessels in any area
except a designated mooring area, and except in the case of an
emergency arising out of the perils of the sea or disablement, no person
shall temporarily anchor or moor a vessel in the mooring area unless
specifically authorized by the village pursuant to this chapter. No

buoy is exchanged in accordance with this chapter, the mooring buoy
tackle shall be raised and inspected before another vessel is placed on
that mooring buoy. Mooring buoy tackle found to be in poor condition
shall not be used until it has been made safe by the owner or his agent.
Every three years, mooring buoy and tackle must be raised and
inspected by a Mooring Inspector who is licensed by the Town of North
Hempstead to do such inspections, and defective parts must be
replaced. No mooring permit shall be issued without an inspection
certificate. In the event of a dispute between an owner and Mooring
Inspector, the village or its designee may arbitrate and issue a ruling.
C. Responsibility of owner upon expiration or revocation of individual or
commercial mooring permit. Mooring buoy and tackle in a space for
which a permit has expired and for which a renewal application has not
been timely received shall be removed by the owner. If such buoy and

ARTICLE III
Harbor Permits
§ 151-17. Structure permit.
A. Erection of structures requires a village permit. No person shall
construct or erect any structure in the harbor without a valid permit
from the village. The issuance of any necessary permits from the federal
or state government, or any other regulatory authority, does not relieve
any party seeking to erect a structure from the requirements of this
chapter or Chapter 155, Zoning, of the Code of the Village of
Manorhaven.
B. No structure shall be placed, nor shall any person construct or place
any structure so that it lies within the lines of any channel, mooring
area or buffer area as defined in this chapter and shown on the Mooring
Plan.
C. Permits previously issued by the village will remain in full force and
effect.
D. Application for permits and renewals.
(1) Every person who shall apply for a permit to construct or enlarge,
or cause the same to be done, a structure regulated by this chapter
shall file a verified application in duplicate on forms to be provided
by the village, and shall pay the fee. The application form shall
require the applicant to state, at a minimum:
(a) The applicant's name and address.
(b) The applicant's status as user of the upland immediately
abutting the mean high-water mark at the place where such
structure is proposed to be constructed or maintained.
(c) The manner in which such upland is zoned.
(d) The exact use to which the applicant intends to put such
upland after the permit is issued.
(e) The exact use to which the applicant intends to put such
structure after the permit is issued.
(f) The length and width of the proposed structure.
(g) The estimated cost of the proposed structure.
(h) A general description of any other structures proposed to be
erected on such structure.
(i) What is the number of off-street parking spaces required under
Chapter 155, Zoning, of the Village Code for the use and how

136:477
(j) Environmental assessment form. Where the application is for
new structures in waterways adjacent to upland multifamily
residential uses (including cooperative associations,
condominium associations and homeowners' associations),
marine or nonmarine commercial uses and yacht clubs, the
applicant shall file an appropriate environmental assessment
form.
(2) The village will accept copies of applications submitted to the Army
Corps of Engineers and the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation to the extent such applications
provide the required information.
(3) Permits issued hereunder shall be transferable. Within six months
of the transfer of title to a structure for which a permit has been
issued, the new owner shall file a change of name with the Village
Clerk. Failure to file the change of name within this period shall
result in automatic termination of the permit. In the event that a
change of name is not timely filed, a new permit application must
be submitted by the new owner(s) of the upland tract adjacent to
the structure.
E. Permit procedure. Upon receipt of an application, the Village Clerk
shall determine if said application is complete, and if so, shall process
the application according to the following procedures:
(1) Residential permits.
(a) For applications for a residential use permit, the
Superintendent of Buildings shall examine said application for
compliance with this chapter and the laws, ordinances,
regulations or specifications governing such structures. If the
application and proposed structure comply, the Superintendent
of Building's decision shall be transmitted to the Village Clerk,
who shall in turn inform the applicant by mail.
(b) Upon approval by the Superintendent of Buildings, the Village
Clerk shall issue the original or renewal permit, provided that
all requirements have been satisfied. The Superintendent of
Buildings may impose such conditions upon the issuance of a
permit which may be reasonable and necessary to carry out the
purposes of this chapter, including the condition that an
applicant post a bond adequate to insure faithful performance
of authorized construction. Should the Superintendent of
Buildings disapprove the application, the Village Clerk shall
not issue a permit, and the applicant may appeal to the Board
of Zoning and Appeals within 30 days of such denial.
(2) Multifamily residential, marine commercial, nonmarine
commercial, yacht club and perimeter reconfiguration permits,
except as provided for under Chapter 155.
§ 151-17 MANORHAVEN CODE § 151-17
136:478
(a) For applications for a permit for multifamily residential,
marine commercial, nonmarine commercial, yacht club use or
for a perimeter permit, all application materials will be
presented to the Superintendent of Buildings, who shall
examine the application for compliance with this chapter and
the laws, ordinances, regulations or specifications governing
such structures. Upon the completion of such review, the
Superintendent of Buildings shall transfer the application to
the appropriate Village Board for site plan review.
(b) Upon approval by the Village Board of Trustees, the Village
Clerk shall issue the appropriate permit.
F. Reconfiguration perimeter permit. A permit issued for a dock, pier and

facility, provided that:
(1) All configurations remain within the dock perimeter as shown on
the attached plans, including ensuring that there is a minimum of a
ten-foot offset from the federal channel for any dock perpendicular
thereto or 15 feet for any dock parallel thereto;
(2) No additional boat slips are created beyond those authorized and
approved as a result of the permits;
(3) No dredging activities are undertaken beyond those which are
authorized and approved as a result of this permit without the
proper regulatory approvals;
(4) No excavation, bulkheading and/or filling activities are undertaken
without the proper regulatory approvals;
(5) No change in functional use of the docking facilities can be taken
without the proper regulatory approvals (e.g., a floating structure
shall not be converted to fixed deck); and
(6) The applicant is in compliance with any other permit issued by the
Army Corps of Engineers or Department of Environmental
Conservation.
G. Maintenance of structures. The permittee who shall erect, cause to be
erected or maintain any structure pursuant to this chapter shall keep
such structure in good repair and condition at all times so that it will
not become a menace to navigation, to persons using the same or to the
environment. Upon finding that there is reasonable cause to believe
that such permittee has failed to comply with this section, the
Superintendent of Buildings may declare the structure unsafe for use
and require repair within 30 days. If after 30 days the permittee has not
complied with the order of Superintendent of Buildings and the
Superintendent of Buildings has not extended the period for
§ 151-17 TAXATION § 151-17
136:479
compliance, then the permittee will be subject to the penalties as
provided for in this chapter. If after 90 days from the Superintendent of
Building's order a permittee has not complied, then the Village Board
of Trustees may revoke the permit after a public hearing on notice
mailed to permittee's and the upland owner's last known address at
least 10 days prior to such hearing, and order the permittee or the
owner of the upland to repair or remove such structure in a period of
time not to exceed 30 days. Such order may authorize the removal of
such structure by the village after the expiration of this period, in which
case the cost of removal shall be charged to such permittee, or the
owner of the upland, or both. No permit or certificate for a structure
issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed as a warrant of the
integrity, safety or engineering and design of any structure, and no one
shall place reliance on any permit, certificate or representation of the
village concerning any aspect of the structure.
H. Standards. No structure shall be constructed, erected, enlarged,
installed, altered or improved unless it shall comply with the following
standards:
(1) General standards.
(a) No structure shall be permitted if it would unreasonably
impede, obstruct or interfere with navigation, the rights of
adjoining owners or the public use of or passage along the
foreshore or the waterway, or harmfully affect the
environment.
(b) Except as provided under Subsection H(3), no structure, vessel
or combination thereof shall be permitted to project into the
waterway a distance greater than required to reach navigable
water depth, or to a length exceeding 100 feet, whichever is
less.
(c) No structure or vessels shall extend within a distance of 50 feet
of any federally designated channel, vessel accessway, fairway
or anchorage, except where a legally existing marine
commercial use or yacht club can establish that the existence
of such structures or placement of such vessels will not impede
the safety of marine traffic in the designated channel, vessel
accessway, fairway or anchorage and that such structures or
placement of such vessels existed in their present form as of
October 1, 1991.
(d) Notwithstanding the fact that a proposed residential structure
shall not comply with this chapter in any respect, the Board of
Zoning and Appeals may direct that such permit be issued if it
shall find that compliance with this chapter in such respect will
create practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, or if it
shall find that the proposed structure is in the public interest.

least six feet, by providing a means of access across the
main body of the dock itself, or by providing a clearly
marked path across the upland immediately adjacent to
the dock, which will serve the same purpose. All fixed
docks lawfully existing prior to the effective date of this
chapter must comply with this provision within 12 months
of the effective date of this chapter.

shall be compatible with this chapter and, if the upland
property is within the enforcement jurisdiction of the village,
with the zoning regulations of the village as well as with all
other applicable public health laws and other applicable
requirements, and shall conform to the generally accepted
standards of construction for the prevention of fire hazards.
(d) No structure in a waterway shall be permitted unless it shall be
water-dependent and, except in the case of bulkheads, used
solely for the purpose of gaining access to a waterway for
commerce, navigation, fishing or recreation.
(e) Any structure within a waterway utilized in connection with
adjacent premises shall be the minimum necessary to meet the
upland use.
(f) With respect to residential or multifamily residential permits,
no vessel slip shall be hired out or used on a seasonal or
permanent basis for dockage use by persons not actually
residing at the premises. Such use of a vessel slip shall
constitute a violation of this chapter.
(g) Except as provided under Subsection H(3)(c), there shall be no
more than one dock or floating dock per lot or lot group with
less than 75 feet of shoreline frontage. One additional dock or
floating dock shall be allowed for each additional 75 feet of

pursuant to this chapter shall be at a minimum level necessary
to meet the purpose for which the bulkhead is being
constructed, and shall in any event not be higher than six feet
above mean high sea level as defined in the Datum Plane
unless a certified engineering report is submitted showing that
a height in excess of six feet is required for public safety
reasons. All bulkheads shall also comply with generally
accepted standards of marine construction.
(l) All structures shall be composed only of materials which, in the
judgment of the Superintendent of Buildings, will have no
adverse effects on the environment or water quality.
(m) Lighting on any structure must be of a type which will not be
confused with navigation lighting, must meet United States
Coast Guard standards and must not produce offensive glare
when viewed from land or water.
(3) Additional provisions for structures adjacent to multifamily
residential, marine commercial, nonmarine commercial and yacht
club uses.
(a) The Village Board of Trustees may permit a specific number,
configuration, width and length of docks, floats or slips other
than what would be allowed under Subsection H(2), where the
applicant can demonstrate that the proposed design or
additional number of docks, floats or slips is needed to
accommodate the associated use.
(b) The permissible number, configuration and width of docks,
floats and slips shall be determined by considering the
location, limiting natural features of the site, demonstrated
need for such structures, effect on navigation, infringement on
public lands and compliance with the other sections of this
chapter. No structure, vessel or combination thereof shall
unreasonably impede the public's use, benefit or enjoyment of
publicly owned shorefront and underwater lands. Where, in the
judgment of the Village Board of Trustees, impairment of the

136:482
§ 151-18. Mooring permits.
public's use and enjoyment of such publicly owned areas
cannot be avoided, the upland owner may be required to afford
to the public a reasonable and convenient means of access over
or around the structure.
(c) Any new docking facilities, slips or moorings or expansion or
increase in existing docking facilities, slips or moorings for
marine commercial, multiple residential and yacht club uses
shall be required to:
[1] Demonstrate that sufficient marine sanitation pumpout
capacity exists or that a satisfactory alternative approved
by the Village Board of Trustees is available, so as to
accomplish the removal of sanitary wastes from all vessels
associated with the use; and
[2] Provide for the collection and proper disposal of solid
waste (garbage, trash, etc.), grease, oil and gasoline.
(d) In areas adjacent to multifamily residential or nonmarine
commercial uses, in no case shall more than two docks be
permitted per 100 feet of shoreline frontage. For multifamily
residential uses, in no case shall there be more than one boat
slip or mooring per residential unit.
(e) Any use permitted to dispense gasoline, diesel fuel, mixed
fuels, engine oils and similar supplies shall show compliance
with all federal and state laws dealing with oil spill prevention.
(f) In addition to the requirements specified under this section,
the following shall apply for docks, floats or slips adjacent to
nonmarine commercial uses:
[1] The docks or slips are limited to short-term transient use
and shall be designated as the same, except for vessels
owned by the adjacent upland owner;
[2] The area associated with the dock or slip may be used only
as a means of vessel access to the upland use or for public

A. Permit process.
(1) Any person desiring to procure an individual mooring permit for
tackle and buoy shall file with the Village Clerk a written
application upon a form furnished by the village or the Town of
North Hempstead. Such application shall state the name, type,
length and registration number, if any, of the vessel. An application
for an individual mooring permit shall also include the name of the
owner or lessee or charterer, if any, together with such proof of
ownership or right to use of the vessel as the village or the Town of
North Hempstead may require. A company making such
application shall designate a living person as its representative.
The annual administrative fee shall be set by resolution of the
Board of Trustees and shall accompany the application.
(2) Only one individual mooring permit shall be issued to any person.
Applicant must have legal registration for the vessel (if such is
required), or where no registration is required, a description of the
vessel and a notarized statement of the applicant swearing
ownership of the vessel.
(3) The Board of Trustees has the authority to approve or deny each
application for a permit.
(4) Mooring tackle and buoy permits shall be issued only to the owner,
lessee or charterer of the vessel to be moored.
(5) An individual permit shall be issued upon the payment of an annual
administrative fee as determined by resolution of the Board of
Trustees for a vessel moored offshore, irrespective of where
moored.
(6) Each vessel shall be measured from bow to stem on a center line
over the deck.
(7) There shall be a charge as determined by resolution of the Board of
Trustees for the issuance of a duplicate decal to replace a lost or
misplaced decal.
(8) Requests for a new mooring tackle and buoy permit may be
obtained from and approved by the village at any time, specifying
the type and size of the vessel for which the mooring tackle and
buoys are requested. After February 5, the last date for filing
applications for renewal of mooring tackle and buoy permits,
applications for new permits will be forwarded to those persons
who have requested the same as space is available for the type and
size of vessel for which mooring tackle and buoy space has been
§ 151-18 MANORHAVEN CODE § 151-19
136:484
requested. Within the limits of type and size of vessel, priority will
be given in the forwarding of applications for permits in the order
in which requests for such permits have been filed with the village.
(9) Only one mooring tackle or buoy space shall be allotted to any one
vessel.
(10) The permittee must demonstrate that he has legal access to his
vessel from a point of land located in Manorhaven.
B. Display of permit. The issuance of an individual mooring permit shall be

exterior port side of said vessel, and only on the particular vessel for
which an application is on file.

(1) Individual mooring permits are not transferable or assignable from
person to person or vessel to vessel, except as herein provided.
Subject to the consent of the Waterways Committee and upon
payment of a fee as determined by resolution of the Board of
Trustees, the holder of a permit may exchange such permit with the
holder of another permit so as to allow an exchange of locations
between such two holders within the same mooring perimeter or
area. The holder of a permit may substitute another vessel of which
such holder is the owner, lessee or charterer for the vessel
originally specified in such mooring tackle and buoy permit,
provided that the Waterways Committee approves such
substitution upon written application therefor.
(2) In the event that the holder of an individual mooring permit sells
his vessel while the permit is still in force, he shall immediately
notify the village and the Town of North Hempstead in writing. The
party holding such individual mooring permit shall cause the decal
to be removed prior to the vessel's delivery to the purchaser.
(3) It is a violation of this chapter for any person issued a permit or
decal to transfer or cause to be transferred such permit or decal to
any other person or vessel. This violation shall apply to both the
person so transferring and person so receiving or benefiting from
the transfer.
D. Renewal of permit. The applicant shall file with the village a renewal
application for such a permit on or before February 5 of the year for
which the permit is to be effective. The village reserves the right to
reassign space based upon availability and size of vessels within the
Village Mooring Area. The prescribed fee for the renewal of the
necessary permit shall be paid at the time the application is filed. In the

perimeter.
C. Standards.
(1) All mooring perimeters must be designed to allow vessels to enter

moorings to keep moored vessels from colliding, said distance to be
dependent on accepted standards for the type of mooring
equipment installed.
§ 151-19 MANORHAVEN CODE § 151-20
136:486

which may be placed within it. While fewer than the approved
number of moorings may be placed, at no time may the maximum
be exceeded. Within the perimeter, mooring locations may be
moved.
(6) All moorings that are part of a perimeter permit issued to a yacht
club may be used only by members of said club and may not be
leased, traded, swapped, loaned or in any way utilized by
nonmembers. However, each club may set aside no more than 10
moorings as guest moorings, to be utilized by visiting vessels for a
period not to exceed 10 days. The application for the perimeter
permit must indicate how many guest moorings will be established,
if any. These moorings shall be visibly marked in accordance with
standards to be established by the Waterways Committee.
(7) No yacht club may request more moorings within its perimeter
than a number equal to the number of vessels owned by the club's
members plus 10. No multifamily residential use may request more
moorings within its perimeter than a number equal to the vessels
owned by the residents, with each residential unit being eligible for
only one mooring of a vessel owned by that resident and
maintained within the designated mooring field. The total number
of moorings within the perimeter of the multifamily residential use
will not exceed the total number of residential units.
(8) Perimeter mooring permits issued to marine, commercial clubs,
multifamily residential and nonmarine commercial users shall be
limited to a zone adjacent to the upland, unless the village approves
a mooring perimeter to be established elsewhere.
(9) The holders of perimeter permits shall record the location and
names, length, draft, beam and type of all vessels moored in its
area. The position of each mooring shall be noted upon a map or

The village and the Town of North Hempstead must be notified
within 30 days when either contact person is changed.
(11) Holders of perimeter permits shall pay a fee for the perimeter
permit itself and also an annual fee determined by the number of
moorings within the perimeter. Such fees shall be determined by
the Board of Trustees. Holders of perimeter permits shall annually
update plans with the village and the Town of North Hempstead,
indicating any change in the number of moorings requested for
their perimeter. Permit holders may also request changes during
the season, filing the appropriate forms along with the appropriate
fees.
D. Review procedure for commercial mooring perimeter permits. Upon
receipt of a complete permit application and appropriate
documentation, the village shall review the permit application. A permit

E. Criteria for consideration of commercial mooring perimeter permits.
The Board of Trustees shall approve with conditions or disapprove an
application for a commercial mooring perimeter permit. The approval,
approval with conditions, or disapproval of any application for a

(1) General criteria. The proposal for which an application is made
shall not result in:
(a) Navigation. An actual or potential hazard to navigation.
(b) Environment. An adverse environmental impact.
(c) Diminution to public safety and community enhancement.
(2) Specific criteria. The permit shall be denied if:
(a) The proposal does not provide adequate fairways for access to
and from open waters.
(b) The proposed permit is determined to be inconsistent with the
policies and purposes of the Local Waterfront Revitalization
Program of the Village of Manorhaven and the Harbor
Management Plan contained within it.
(c) The proposal would result in a significant adverse
environmental impact.
(d) Failure to provide adequate upland parking as required by
Chapter 155, Zoning; if the number of vessels to be
accommodated in the mooring perimeter field does not exceed
the demonstrated number of vessels accommodated at the
facility as of the effective date of this chapter, no additional
§ 151-20 MANORHAVEN CODE § 151-20
136:488
parking is required. If the number of vessels is increased,
parking must be increased to meet the needs of those
additional vessels as specified in Chapter 155, Zoning.
F. Duration and revocation. Mooring perimeter permits issued in the year
1999 shall have the duration of one year terminating on April 1, 2000. A
mooring perimeter permit, upon approval, issued in the year 2000 shall
remain in effect for three years and may be renewed as of right
thereafter for additional three-year terms, provided that the village has
not revoked the permit upon a determination that the permittee has
failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit and that
there has been no change in ownership of the marina or other entity to
whom the permit was issued. No mooring perimeter permit shall be
revoked unless the village shall have served the holder of the perimeter
with a written notice of the manner in which the holder has violated the
terms and conditions of that permit. If the permittee fails to cure those
violations within 10 days of that written notice, then the village may
revoke the mooring perimeter permit after a public hearing conducted
not less than 10 days after service of written notice of such hearing.
Notice under this section shall be served upon the holder of the
perimeter permit personally or by certified mail, return receipt
requested, at the last known address of said holder of the perimeter
permit. Service of the notice shall be effective upon mailing.

date of this chapter shall continue. Members of the Board of Zoning
and Appeals shall be appointed by the Mayor, subject to approval
by the Board of Trustees, and shall reside within the Village of
Manorhaven. Members shall serve for terms such that one
member's term shall expire at the end of the Village official year in
which such member was initially appointed; and the remaining
members' terms shall be so fixed that one member's term shall
expire at the end of each official year thereafter. At the expiration
of each original member's appointment, the replacement member
shall be appointed for a term of five years.
(2) The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of said Board shall be
designated annually by the Mayor. The Chairman or, in his absence,
the Deputy Chairman shall have the power to issue subpoenas for
the attendance of witnesses and the production of records and may
administer oaths.
(3) The Board of Zoning and Appeals shall have such powers and
duties as prescribed by law. In exercising its powers, the Board of
Zoning and Appeals may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or
modify any order, requirement, decision or determination appealed
from and make such order, requirement, decision or determination
as ought to be made and, to that end, shall have all the powers of
the administrative officer from whom the appeal is taken. In taking
any action, the Board of Zoning and Appeals may impose such
conditions or restrictions as it may find reasonable.

136:583

(5) An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action in
respect of which the decision appealed was made from, unless the
Code Official certifies to the Board of Zoning and Appeals after
notice of the appeal shall have been given him that, by reason of
facts stated in the certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to
life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other

Law § 7-712-b.
(3) Special use permits.

the Board of Zoning and Appeals, no such permit shall be
issued by such Board unless the Board shall first consider the
public health, safety and welfare and the comfort and
convenience of the public in general and of the residents of the
immediate neighborhood in particular. Such Board may
prescribe such appropriate conditions and safeguards as may
be required in order that the result of this action shall, to the
maximum extent possible, further the expressed intent of this
chapter and the accomplishment of the following objectives:
[1] That all proposed structures, equipment or material shall
be readily accessible to fire and police protection.
[2] That all proposed uses shall be of such location, size and
character that, in general, they will be in harmony with the
appropriate and orderly development of the district in
which they are proposed to be situated and will not be
detrimental to the orderly development of adjacent
properties in accordance with the zoning classification of
such properties.
[3] That, in addition to the above, in the case of any use
located in or directly adjacent to a residential district:
[a] The location and size of such use, the nature and
intensity of operations involved in or conducted in
connection therewith, its site layout and its relation to
access streets shall be such that both pedestrian and
vehicular traffic to and from the use and the assembly
of persons in connection therewith will not be
hazardous or inconvenient to or incongruous with said
residential or commercial district or conflict with the
normal traffic of the neighborhood and that there will
be off-hour or nonpeak traffic ingressing or egressing
from the property and that there will be adequate
access to it for purposes of fire and safety protection,
including traffic control.
§ 155-60 TAXATION § 155-60
136:585
[b] The location and height of buildings, the location,
nature and height of walls, fences and other accessory
uses and the nature and extent of landscaping on the
site shall be such that the use will not hinder or
discourage the appropriate development and use of
adjacent land and buildings.
[4] That the nature and intensity of such use sought in a
residential, commercial or industrial district and the traffic
generated by it shall not be hazardous, incongruous or
detrimental to the prevailing residential or commercial
character of the neighborhood.
[5] That each use in a residential, commercial or industrial
district shall be harmonious with the district in which its
location is sought, shall not create undue pedestrian or
vehicular traffic hazards and shall not include any signs,
noise, fumes or lights or other accessory uses without
special permit that will hinder normal development of the
district or impair the use, enjoyment and value of adjacent
land and buildings.
(b) In granting any such permit, such Board may also:
[1] Require any landscaping or other treatments which it
deems necessary to protect the value of adjacent
properties or to prevent any hindering of the appropriate
development of adjacent land.
[2] Require that the special use permit is periodically
renewed, if not otherwise required by law. Such renewal
may be granted only after public notice and hearing and
may be granted upon any condition which could have been
imposed at the time of granting the original permit. Such
renewal may not be denied unless the Board shall
determine that such conditions as may have been
prescribed by the Board in conjunction with the issuance
of the original permit or a prior renewal have not been or
are no longer being complied with.
(c) In making a determination on an application for a special use
permit, the Board shall give consideration, among other things,
to:
[1] The preservation of environmental and ecological assets of
the property, including the physical conditions and
topography thereof.
[2] Whether the character, size, location and design of the
proposed use is an appropriate use of land and in harmony
with surrounding property.
§ 155-60 MANORHAVEN CODE § 155-60
136:586
[3] The contribution which the proposed use will make to the
proper growth and development of the Village.
[4] The impact of the proposed use on vehicular and
pedestrian traffic, disposition of stormwater, sewage,
garbage and refuse and other municipal services.
[5] Whether the proposed use and/or vehicular traffic
generated thereby will cause obnoxious gases, odors,
smoke, soot, noise, vibration, light or other disturbing
emissions and their impact on air quality.
[6] Adequacy of public utilities to serve the proposed use and
of access thereto by fire and other emergency apparatus.
(d) If the Board of Zoning and Appeals shall determine that a
proposed special use will conform to the general character of
the neighborhood to which the proposed use will apply and
that the public health, morals, safety and general welfare of
such neighborhood will be secure by the granting of such use,
subject to the safeguards imposed by the Board, then the
Board of Zoning and Appeals shall authorize the issuance of a
permit. Such permits may be granted for a temporary period or
permanently, as determined by the Board, and, if granted for a
temporary period, application for extension of the same will be
subject to a public hearing as required in the original
application.
(e) If the Board of Zoning and Appeals finds that the special use
proposed and requested in said application will not conform to
the general character of the neighborhood to which the
proposed use will apply and that the public health, morals,
safety and general welfare of such neighborhood will not be
secured by granting such conditional use, then the Board of
Zoning and Appeals shall deny such application, anything in
this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding.
(f) If, upon an application for extension of a temporary or special
use permit, the Board finds that the applicant has violated the
conditions imposed in the granting of the same or if the Board
finds that, because of a change in the general character of the
neighborhood, the public health, safety, morals and general
welfare will be adversely affected by the extension of such
special use permit, then the Board of Zoning and Appeals may
deny an application for extension of such special use permit,
anything in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding.

provided herein, all applications to the Board of Zoning and Appeals

ARTICLE XII
Illegal Occupancies
[Added 9-28-2017 by L.L. No. 23-2017]
§ 155-92. through § 155-99. (Reserved)
§ 155-100. Legislative intent; purpose.
The Village Board of Trustees hereby finds that there exist in the Village of
Manorhaven serious conditions arising from the rental of dwelling units that
are substandard, inadequate in size, overcrowded and/or dangerous and/or
are in violation of local and state law, and that the rental of such dwelling
units poses a significant threat to life, limb and property of residents
of the Village and others, tends to promote and encourage deterioration
of housing within the Village, contributes to excessive vehicular traffic
and parking problems and overburdens and has a detrimental effect upon
municipal services. The Board finds that current Code provisions are
inadequate to adequately deter and/or eliminate the existence of such
dwelling units and that adequate legislation regulating these occupancies
is required to promote and preserve the public health, safety, welfare and
good order and governance of the Village. The enactment of the regulations
set forth in this article, which regulations are remedial in nature and effect,
shall have the effect of enhancing the public health, safety, welfare and good
order of the Village.
§ 155-101. Scope.
This article shall apply to all premises and dwelling units within such
premises located within the Village of Manorhaven, whether or not the
use and occupancy thereof shall be permitted under the applicable use
regulations for the zoning district in which such premises or dwelling unit
is located.
§ 155-102. Applicability.
The provisions of this article shall be deemed to supplement applicable
state and local laws, ordinances, codes and regulations. Nothing in this
article shall be deemed to abolish, impair, supersede or replace existing
remedies of the Village, county or state or existing requirements of any
other provision of local law or ordinance of the Village or of the county or
state. In situations where there is a conflict between any provisions of this
article and any applicable state or local law, ordinance, code or regulation,
the more restrictive provision or requirement shall prevail.
§ 155-103. Determination of illegal occupancy.
It shall be unlawful to occupy or permit to be occupied or to assist in the
occupancy of a dwelling unit where the number of occupants exceeds the
permitted number of occupants.
§ 155-92 TAXATION § 155-103
136:625
A. Presumptions of illegal occupancies in single family dwellings.

the Building Inspector. The Building Inspector shall prepare a report of

136:628
§ 155-104. Penalties for offenses.
§ 155-105. Enforcement.
E. Presumptions rebuttable. Any and all of the presumptions raised by
proof of the existence of any such conditions as set forth in this article

fact, exist or that such conditions or the dwelling unit or the occupancy
thereof, in fact, comply with the Code.
F. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent persons living together
with the owner as a family unit, as defined by the Code

court of competent jurisdiction.

ARTICLE XIII
Marijuana
[Added 4-17-2019 by L.L. No. 3-2019; amended 2-27-2020 by L.L.
No. 3-2020]
§ 155-106. Purpose, intent, and findings.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Manorhaven recognizes that the
Governor of the State of New York and leaders of the Legislature of the
State of New York have publicly stated that they plan on enacting legislation
that will legalize the recreational use of marijuana within the state. The
Board further recognizes that the current state of such proposed legislation
is undecided and may include the creation of a state regulatory authority
controlling businesses that will engage in the sale of recreational marijuana
and further that it may include a provision under which certain counties
within the state may opt in or out of such legalization. Given the high level
of uncertainty surrounding such proposed legislation and the form which
it may take, the Board finds that the most sensible course of action is to
impose a temporary moratorium on the establishment of any use within
the Village that involves the sale of marijuana or marijuana products, or
the dispensing or distribution of medical marijuana. Such a moratorium
will temporarily prevent the establishment of any such use until the state
legislation is enacted in its final form, the County of Nassau takes whatever
lawful action in response thereto it deems appropriate, and the Village has
the opportunity to analyze the legal effects of such legislation and craft
appropriate zoning regulations concerning such uses. The Board further
recognizes that such measures were proposed by the Governor and leaders
of the Legislature last year, and in response the Village Board had imposed
a temporary moratorium under Local Law 3-2019. Ultimately, the session
of the Legislature ended without the passage of substantive legislation
to legalize marijuana, and the Village's Board of Trustees allowed the
temporary moratorium to lapse. The Board finds that given the state's
renewed interest in the passage of such legislation, another temporary
moratorium would be appropriate.
§ 155-107. Authority.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Manorhaven is authorized to adopt
this article pursuant to Article IX of the New York State Constitution, the
Municipal Home Rule Law, the relevant provisions of the Village Law of the
State of New York, and the general police power vested with the Village of
Manorhaven to promote the health, safety, and welfare of all of the residents
and property owners in the Village.
§ 155-108. Definitions.
For the purpose of this article, unless specified below, all terms shall be
as defined in the Zoning Code of the Village of Manorhaven, New York
(Chapter 155 of the Village Code).105
§ 155-106 TAXATION § 155-109
136:631

or supplemented by further local law of the Village of Manorhaven.
§ 155-111. Moratorium.

building permit, an application for a variance, an application for site plan
approval, or an application for a special use permit, seeking to establish a
use involving the sale of marijuana or marijuana products or the dispensing
or distribution of medical marijuana, whether said application was
submitted prior to or after the effective date of this article. The state
statutory and locally-enacted time periods for processing and making
decisions on all aspects of applications for a variance(s) from any state
or local land use law as indicated are suspended and stayed while this
article is in effect. No existing approved use within the Village shall be
permitted to begin the sale, dispensing, or distribution of marijuana or
medical marijuana, regardless of the comparative amount of activity
involving such sale, dispensing or distribution with other activities already
permitted therein.
§ 155-112. Exceptions.
This article shall not apply to:
A. An existing valid building permit and substantial construction having
commenced in reliance thereon.
B. The issuance of a building permit required in connection with the
ordinary repairs, maintenance, and/or interior renovations of a
structure, and minor exterior changes such as a replacement of

Law or any local ordinance, law, or regulation, this article supersedes,
amends, and takes precedence over the Village Law and such local
A. The Board of Trustees shall have the authority to vary or waive the
application of any provision of this article, in its legislative discretion,
upon its determination that such variance or waiver is required to
alleviate an unnecessary hardship affecting a lot. To grant such a
request, the Board of Trustees must find that a variance or waiver will
not adversely affect the purpose of this article, the health, safety, or
welfare of the Village of Manorhaven, nor will it substantially
undermine the land use planning and potential revision process under
review. The Board of Trustees shall take into account the existing land
use in the immediate vicinity of the property and the impact of the
variance or waiver on infrastructure, neighborhood and community
character, natural resources, government services, and other
environmental issues. The development application must comply with
all other applicable provisions of the Village's local laws and Village
Code.
B. Any application for a variance or waiver shall be filed with the Village
Clerk and shall include a fee of $500 for the processing of such
application. An application for a variance or waiver shall contain the
complete details of the proposed improvement project. To the extent
that the Board of Trustees requires a consultant to assist it in reviewing
such application, it may also require the applicant to pay the reasonable
costs of such consultant. Any consultant shall be selected in the sole
discretion of the Board of Trustees.
C. In the sole discretion of the Board of Trustees, the Board may refer any
application for a variance or waiver of this article to any official,
department, and/or land use board. The Board of Trustees shall not be
bound by any recommendation of any official, department, or land use
board and shall conduct a public hearing and make a final decision on
the application, with or without conditions. The Board of Trustees shall
render a decision on an application for a variance or waiver of this
article within 60 calendar days of the Village Clerk's receipt of a
complete application.
D. The Board of Trustees shall notify the applicant of the Board's decision
to approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application to vary or
waive the application of any provision of this article. In the event that
the Board of Trustees determines to approve such application, the
applicant may seek approvals from the relevant officials and/or land use
boards under the terms set forth within the Board of Trustee's decision.

Village of Manorhaven), site plan applications (§ 7-725-a of the Village

Code of the Village of Manorhaven), pursuant to the Village's municipal
home rule powers pursuant to Municipal Home Rule Law § 10 and § 22 to

without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this article supersedes the
provisions contained in Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law
(known as the State Environmental Quality Review Act) and the regulations
thereunder to the extent that such provisions require that an agency
determine the environmental significance of an application within certain
specified timeframes.

such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent portion.
Such declaration shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions
hereof, which other portions shall continue in full force and effect.
