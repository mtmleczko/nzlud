PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the Town of Kernersville, North Carolina of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1980 Code, as supplemented through July, 1986, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of aldermen. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1980 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date periodically. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Therese Pine, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to John G. Wolfe III, Town Attorney, and Randy McCaslin, Town Manager, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

Ct. 1223 (2001) and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, New Hanover County, North Carolina, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Board of Aldermen finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
(3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
(4)  Offering and providing private or semi-private booths or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. 
(5)  Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. 
(6)  At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections. 
(7)  Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States -six hundred (600) in 1982, two thousand two hundred (2,200) in 1983, four thousand six hundred (4,600) in 1984, eight thousand five hundred fifty-five (8,555) in 1985, two hundred fifty-three thousand and four hundred forty-eight (253,448) through 1992, and seven hundred seventy-four thousand and four hundred sixty-seven (774,467) through 2000. 
(8)  As of December 31, 2002, there have been twenty-three thousand seven hundred seventy (23,770) reported cases of HIV and AIDS in the State of North Carolina. 
(9)  Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in North Carolina. 
(10)  The number of cases of early (less than one (1) year) syphilis in the United States reported annually rose between 1982 and 1990, but has decreased since then. Nonetheless, North Carolina has a syphilis rate that exceeds the national average. 
(11)  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million (500,000) cases being reported in 1990, an estimated national number of cases of more than six hundred fifty thousand (650,000) in 1999. According to the Center for Disease Control, the gonorrhea rate in North Carolina exceeds the national average. 
(12)  The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
(13)  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
(14)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(15)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. 
(16)  Operation of sexually oriented businesses after 11:00 P.M. and the consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises of a sexually oriented business exacerbate the deleterious secondary effects of such business in the town. 
(17)  The findings noted in subsections number (1) through (16) raise substantial governmental concerns and thus, sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(18)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the town. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(19)  Removal of doors on adult booths, requiring a separation between performers and patrons and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres. 
(20)  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(21)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(22)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
(23)  The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article. 
(24)  The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(25)  The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the Town will be promoted by the enactment of this article.

(a)  The following enumerated and described conditions are hereby found, deemed and declared to constitute a detriment, danger and hazard to the health, safety, and general welfare of the inhabitants of the Town, and the same are found, deemed and declared, to be public nuisances wherever the same may exist. The creation, maintenance, or failure to abate any of the following is hereby declared unlawful: 
(1)  Any condition which constitutes a breeding ground or harbor for rats, mosquitoes, harmful insects, or other pests; 
(2)  Any growth or overgrowth of grass, weeds or other vegetation that is greater than one (1) foot on the average, or any accumulation of dead weeds, grass, brush or undergrowth. This section shall not apply to lots that are natural area lots unless the lot is found to violate section 10-1(a)(1) or 10-1(a)(3-6). Natural area lots are lots that have never been cleared in anticipation of development, lots that have been cleared at some point in the past but on which new plant growth has occurred and returned or is returning the lot to a natural state, or lots that have been landscaped or replant to appear as natural, undeveloped areas. If a natural area lot is adjacent to a property occupied by a dwelling or other structure, and that dwelling or other structure is located within fifty (50) feet of the natural area lot, then the natural area lot shall comply with the requirements of this subsection to a depth of ten (10) feet from said adjacent property line, however, this requirement shall not apply to property that consists of a ravine, creek bank or other severe slope where maintenance would be unsafe and the chance of erosion would increase if the vegetation were decreased. 
(3)  Any concentration of combustible items including but not limited to mattresses, boxes, paper, automobile tires and tubes, garbage, trash, refuse, brush, old clothes and rags; 
(4)  Any collection of garbage, food waste, animal waste, or any other rotten or putrescible matter of any kind; 
(5)  Any furniture, appliances, or metal products of any kind or nature openly kept which have jagged edges of metal or glass, or areas of confinement; or 
(6)  Any condition which blocks, hinders, or obstructs in any way the natural flow of branches, streams, creeks, surface waters, ditches, or drains, to the extent that the premises is not free from standing water. 
(7)  Any and all grass or weeds growing in any sidewalk and any hedges bordering thereon not properly trimmed. 
(8)  Any and all trees or bushes either dead, diseased or not properly trimmed, or any object or growth within the sight distance, on private property adjacent to Town street rights-of-way that constitute a hazard to Town property or to the health or safety of motorists or pedestrians. "Sight distance" shall be defined as the area required to provide an unobstructed view across property primarily located at street intersections, driveways, and along sharp horizontal curves in the roadway. 
(b)  No owner, lessee or occupant, or any agent, servant, representative or employee of any such owner, lessee or occupant, having control of any lot or land in the Town, regardless of whether the lot is occupied or not, shall permit or maintain on such lot or land, or on or along the sidewalk, street or alley adjacent to the same between the property line and the curb or middle of the alley or for ten (10) feet outside the property line if there is no curb, any of the conditions described in this section. It shall be the joint and several duty of any owner, lessee and occupant of any lot or land to cut and/or remove or cause to be cut and/or removed all causes of such conditions as often as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
(c)  Chronic violator. A chronic violator is a person who owns property whereupon, in the previous calendar year, the Town gave a notice of violation at least three times under Section 10-1(a)(2). The Town may notify a chronic violator of Section 10-1(a)(2) that, if the violator's property is found to again be in violation of Section 10-1(a)(2), the Town shall, without further notice in the calendar year in which notice is given, take action to remedy the violation and the expense of the action shall become a lien upon the property in accordance with G.S. § 160A-193. The initial annual notice shall be served by registered or certified mail. When service is made by registered or certified mail, a copy of the notice may also be sent by regular mail. Service shall be deemed sufficient if the registered or certified mail is unclaimed or refused, but the regular mail is not returned by the post office within ten days after the mailing. Pursuant to G.S. § 160A-193(b), the expense of the action is also a lien on any other real property owned by the person in default within the city limits or within one mile of the city limits, except for the person's primary residence. A lien established pursuant to this subsection is inferior to all prior liens and shall be collected as a money judgment.

The vegetation shall be composed of evergreen plants, four (4) feet tall upon installation, spaced not more than five (5) feet on center, so that a continuous, unbroken hedgerow (without gaps or open spaces) will exist to a height of at least eight (8) feet along the length of the fence surrounding the areas affected by this article. The fence and vegetation shall be set back a minimum of ten (10) feet from any street right-of-way. 
    An existing outdoor storage area which is completely paved, enclosed by a wire fence, opaque or capable of being rendered opaque, meeting all requirements of this article, and in place at the effective date of this article may remain without vegetative screening, provided that such fence is a minimum of eight (8) feet in height, completely blocks the view of the contents of the outdoor storage area. If the contents of such storage area are not completely visually screened, the owner may erect either a fence of sufficient height to accomplish such complete screening or remove sufficient pavement to allow installation and subsequent growth of vegetative screening.

    The vegetative species selected shall be of sufficient height when mature to completely screen all materials stored in any outdoor storage area. The Zoning Administrator shall direct that appropriate tall growing species be used where storage trailers or stored materials exceed a height of eight (8) feet. 
    Existing vegetation may be utilized for screening, as established by the landscape ordinance, if such vegetation provides a dense, year-round hedgerow forming a high density screen capable of eliminating visual contact of the outdoor storage area from adjacent property and street rights-of-way, and is approved by the Zoning Administrator. 
    The landowner is responsible for maintaining all required plant materials in good health. Good horticultural techniques, such as pruning, mulching, watering, and proper fertilization, shall be implemented so the vegetation will reach a height of eight (8) feet within four (4) years of the date planted and will have maximum density and foliage. Dead, diseased, or damaged vegetation shall be replaced at the next appropriate planting time. Dead, dying, damaged, or missing plants shall be replaced with new planting conforming to all standards of this article.

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Town may provide the services required by this subsection at no cost, or at a reduced cost, to the applicant should the Town desire to provide such support to the public assembly or parade. Such action is not a waiver of a regulatory requirement based upon political, social, or religious grounds or reasons, or based upon the content of the views expressed, but instead is an affirmative act of Town association or speech. 
(e)  Time and notice of decision. The permit official shall approve or deny an application within twenty (20) days of receipt. A notice of denial or revocation shall clearly set forth the grounds upon which the permit was denied or revoked and, where feasible, shall contain a proposal for measures by which the applicant may cure any defects in the application or otherwise procure a permit. Where an application is denied because the proposed event would conflict with another event that has or will be approved, the permit official shall propose an alternative place, if available for the same time, or an alternative time, if available for the same place. 
(f)  Appeals. 
(1)  An applicant may appeal the denial or revocation of an application in writing within ten (10) days after notice of the denial has been received.

a site specific development plan.
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter B  Article I
36

(a) Site Specific Development Plan. A plan of land development submitted to the
local jurisdiction for purposes of obtaining one of the following zoning or land
use permits or approvals in accordance with Article VI of this Ordinance.
(1) Approval of a use requiring a special use permit by the Elected Body in
accordance with Section 6-1.5.
(2) Approval of a one-phase special use district zoning petition or a site plan
amendment to a one-phase special use district zoning petition by the
Elected Body in accordance with Section 6-2.2.
(3) Approval of the first phase of a two-phase development plan which
shows the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels with

first-phase process as noted by Section 6-2.2(E).
(4) Approval of a final development plan by the Planning Board in
accordance with Section 6-2.2(D) pursuant to a two-phase special use
district zoning petition approved by the Elected Body in accordance with
Section 6-2.2(G).
(5) Approval of a preliminary subdivision plan that shows type and intensity
of use as approved by the Elected Body.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither a variance, a sketch plan nor any other
document that does not describe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity
of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property shall constitute a site specific
development plan.
(b) Vested Right. A right pursuant to General Statutes 160A-385.1 to undertake and
complete the development and use of property under the terms and conditions of
an approved site specific development plan.
(3) Establishment of Vested Right.
(a) A vested right shall be deemed established upon the valid approval or approval
with conditions by the Elected Body in compliance with all provisions of this
Ordinance or Subdivision Ordinance, as applicable, of a site specific development
plan, following notice and public hearing.
(b) A vested right must be specifically requested as part of the approval specified in
Section 1-5.2(B)(3)(a) above.

making such findings as are required for approval by this Ordinance.
(d) Notwithstanding Sections 1-5.2(B)(1) and (2), approval of a site specific
development plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall not confer
a vested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained.
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter B  Article I
37
(e) A site specific development plan shall be deemed approved upon the effective
date of approval by the approving authority or ordinance relating thereto, and only
to the extent of that approval.
(f) The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay
zoning that imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type
or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are
applicable to all property subject to land-use regulation by the local jurisdiction,
including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical
codes. Otherwise applicable new or amended regulations shall become effective
with respect to property that is subject to a site specific development plan upon
the expiration or termination of the vested right in accordance with this section.
(g) A vested right is not a personal right, but shall attach to and run with the applicable
property. After approval of a site specific development plan, all successors to the
original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such right while applicable.
(4) Approval Procedures and Vested Rights for Site Specific Development Plans.
(a) Plans shall be submitted and processed in accordance with the procedures
established by this Ordinance and shall be considered by the designated approving
authority for the specific type of zoning or land use permit or approval for which
application is made. A vested right is established once approval is granted by the
approving authority following notice and public hearing.

advertisement procedure as is required by the approving authority for the specific
type of zoning or land use permit or approval for which application is made.
(c) A petitioner for preliminary subdivision approval may waive his/her rights by
signing a waiver form attached to the application form. If these rights are waived,
then a preliminary subdivision plan shall not be required to be an advertised public
hearing.
(d) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the revocation of the original approval or
other remedies for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions of the
approval by the approving authority or of this Ordinance.
(5) Duration.
(a) A right which has been vested as provided for in this section shall remain vested
for a period of five (5) years.
(b) This vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to a site
specific development plan unless expressly provided by the approving authority
at the time the amendment or modification is approved. Following approval or
approval with conditions of a site specific development plan, nothing in this
section shall exempt such a plan from subsequent reviews and approvals to ensure
compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided that
such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original approval.
(c) Upon issuance of a building permit, the expiration provisions of General Statutes
160A-418 and the revocation provision of General Statutes 160A-422 shall apply,
except that a building permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the running
of time while a vested right under this section is outstanding.

contemplated in the site specific development plan;
(d) Compensation. Compensation to the affected landowner for all costs, expenses,
and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not limited to, all fees
paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing,
legal, and other consultant's fees incurred after approval by the local jurisdiction,
together with interest thereon at the legal rate until paid. Compensation shall not
include any diminution in the value of the property which is caused by such action;
(e) Misrepresentation. Findings by the Elected Body, by ordinance after notice and
a hearing, that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied
inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations which made a
difference in the approval by the Elected Body of the site specific development
plan; or,
(f) State or Federal Law. Enactment or promulgation of a State or federal law or
regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the site specific
development plan, in which case the Elected Body may modify the affected
provisions, upon a finding that the change in State or federal law has a
fundamental effect on the plan, by ordinance, after notice and a hearing.
(7) Voluntary Annexation. A petition for annexation filed with the Town of Kernersville
under NCGS 160A-31 or NCGA 160A-58.1 shall contain a signed statement declaring
whether or not any zoning vested right with respect to the properties subject to the petition
has been established under NCGS 160A-385.1 or NCGS 153A-344.1. A statement that
declares that no zoning vested right has been established under NCGS 160A-385.1 or
NCGS 153A-344.1, or the failure to sign a statement declaring whether or not a zoning
vested right has been established, shall be binding on the landowner and any such zoning
vested right shall be terminated.

right shall be treated the same as a violation of this Ordinance and shall be subject to the
same remedies and penalties as any such violation. In addition, the Elected Body may,
after public hearing, revoke any such zoning vested right for failure to abide by any such
term or condition.
(9) Limitations. Nothing in this section is intended or shall be deemed to create any vested
right other than those established pursuant to General Statutes 160A-385.1.

Each residential district is designed and intended to secure for the persons who reside there a comfortable,
healthy, safe, and pleasant environment in which to live, protected from incompatible and disruptive activities
which more properly belong in nonresidential districts. The districts are also intended to assist the community
in meeting the goals of the Kernersville Development Plan. When a residential rezoning proposal is
considered, the residential land use goals and locational criteria contained in the Kernersville Development
Plan shall be used as guides, in conjunction with other factors, in determining the appropriateness of the
proposed district. Other goals of these residential districts are explained in the remainder of this section.
Unified Development Ordinance 43 Chapter B  Article II
(A) AG AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT.
(1) Purpose. The AG District is primarily intended to accommodate uses of an agricultural
nature. The district is also intended to accommodate scattered non-farm residences on
large tracts of land, but is not intended for residential subdivisions with small lots. The
district is established for the following purposes.
(a) To preserve the rural character of portions of the county and encourage the
continued use of land for agricultural, forest, and open space purposes;
(b) To discourage scattered commercial and industrial land uses;
(c) To concentrate urban development in and around existing urbanized areas and
proposed activity centers, thereby preventing premature conversion of farmland
into urban uses; and,
(d) To discourage any use which may create premature public infrastructure and
service demands.

These industrial districts are established to accommodate enterprises engaged in the manufacturing,
processing, or assembling of goods, merchandise, or equipment. The standards established for these districts
are designed to promote industrial development and to protect nearby residential areas from undesirable
aspects of industrial development. Whenever possible, these districts should be separated from residential
districts by natural or structural boundaries, such as streams, topographic features, vegetation, major streets,
or similar features. When an industrial rezoning proposal is considered, the industrial land use goals and
recommendations in the Kernersville Land Use Plan shall be used as guides, in conjunction with other
factors, in determining the appropriateness of the proposed district.
(A) LI LIMITED INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
(1) Purpose. The LI District is primarily intended to accommodate limited manufacturing,
wholesaling, warehousing, research and development, and related commercial and service
activities which, in their normal operations, have little or no adverse effect upon adjoining

(C) MU-S MIXED USE - SPECIAL USE DISTRICT.
(1) Purpose. The MU-S District is intended to accommodate and positively integrate a
balanced mixture of residential, commercial, and in some cases light industrial uses within
the district and the surrounding area. Depending upon the existing land use context in
which the MU-S District is proposed, at least three distinctly different use components are
expected for any MU-S zoning proposal. Building mass, rhythm, scale, and transition, as
well as a cohesive and connected pedestrian and vehicular network are intended to be key
elements of the overall design concept. This district encourages innovation by offering
flexibility in design and layout requirements to achieve a greater choice of living and
working environments. The development design should also be compatible with the natural
terrain and surrounding uses, protect natural and/or historic resources, and provide useful
open space. This district is only permitted through the special use district zoning process.
This district is suitable in activity centers.

that includes a range of housing types, a network of well-connected streets, alleys and blocks,
public spaces, and amenities such as stores, schools, and places of worship within walking
distance of residences or is within walking distance to those land uses. TND projects incorporate
many different high quality architectural styles and site plan design elements to create an
enhanced livable neighbor(s). This district encourages innovation by offering flexibility in
design and layout requirements to achieve a greater choice of living, and working environments.
The development design should also be compatible with the natural terrain and surrounding uses,
protect natural and/or historic resources, and provide useful open space. This district is only

(F) Town of Kernersville Zoning Overlay Districts
(1) Purpose. The State of North Carolina General Statutes permit municipalities to establish
zoning overlay districts. Within the zoning overlay district, additional requirements may
be imposed over the underlying general use and special use zoning districts. The Town of
Kernersville recognizes, through an extensive community discussion process, that general
use and special use zoning districts alone cannot accomplish the goals of the community.
It is determined that zoning overlay districts offer the opportunity to develop growth
management regulations that will guide development towards accomplishing the
community goals of maintaining Kernersvilles small town atmosphere, creating a quality
community, and improving the communitys livability. These goals protect and enhance
individuals welfare and market the community for quality development.
The zoning overlay districts standards require a basic level of site and structural design.
The standards are not intended to limit creativity nor create a community where everything
looks the same. The intent is to serve as a tool for design in the context of developing
Kernersville as a unique place within the Triad while maintaining its sense of place.
Consideration is given to balancing the interests of property owners with the betterment of
the communitys safety, welfare, well-being and aesthetic character.

CHAPTER B - ZONING ORDINANCE
ARTICLE III - OTHER DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
3-1 DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS
3-1.1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
(A) APPLICABILITY
In all zoning districts, every use of a building, structure, or piece of land hereafter erected, modified,
enlarged, or increased in capacity shall comply with the dimensional requirements as set forth in
this section.
(B) NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS AND VARIANCES
There shall be no variations from the dimensional requirements of this section except in
nonconforming situations (Article V) or where the Board of Adjustment may waive the dimensional
requirements (Section 6-1.4(B)).
(C) DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS
The dimensional requirements which specify minimum lot area, minimum lot width, minimum
setbacks, maximum impervious surface cover, maximum height, and minimum contiguous area,
where applicable, are set forth in Table 3.1, Table 3.2, Table 3.3, and Table 3.4. Dimensional and
other requirements of zoning districts are set forth in Section 2-1 of this Ordinance.
(D) SUBDIVIDED ZONING LOTS WITH WRITTEN AGREEMENTS
When a zoning lot existing as of the effective date of this Ordinance is proposed to be subdivided
into two or more zoning lots, the other requirements of the Unified Development Ordinances shall
be applied to each of the subdivided lots, provided, however, that the residential density
requirements and the limits of floodway fringe encroachment provisions of Section C.2-3.2(A) may
be applied, in whole or in part, to any one or more of the subdivided lots and not to the other lot(s)
when such original zoning lot is subdivided under the following conditions:
(1) Floodplain. The original zoning lot encompasses property with designated floodplain area
per Section C.2.
(2) Allocation of Development Rights Between Seller and Purchaser. The owner of the
original zoning lot and the purchaser(s) of a subdivided part have in writing allocated
development rights between or among themselves concerning the development of the
original zoning lot whereby a right, or any portion thereof, to develop all, or any portion
of, a subdivided part of the original zoning lot as permitted in this Ordinance is transferred
to, or is retained by, the remaining portion of the original zoning lot. Development of each
subdivided part pursuant to the terms of the writing shall meet or exceed the requirements
of this Ordinance. The writing shall further provide that the allocation of development
rights shall be appurtenant to and run with the land so benefitted and have the effect of
imposing a negative easement or restriction upon the servient land.
(3) Approval of Plat. The writing constituting the reallocation of development rights must
include, or be represented by, a plat illustrating the reallocation. To be effective, the
writing and plat shall be reviewed for compliance with this Ordinance by the Review
Officer, and if the writing and plat complies with this Ordinance, the Review Officer shall
stamp his approval upon its face, and the writing and plat must then be recorded at the
Forsyth County Register of Deeds. A violation of these requirements shall be a violation
of this Ordinance and unlawful.

2. Larger lot width, depth, or area may be required by the Public Health Department for the installation of septic systems.
3. Certain districts have an option for height (e.g., 60/unlimited). The first number indicates the maximum height allowed at
the minimum setback required adjacent to property zoned RS, RM (except RM-U), YR, AG, or H unless the RS district
contains a habitable residential single family unit located within 150 of a LI property line, then the maximum height shall
be 40 for the adjacent LI zoning lot. Height of the structure above forty (40) feet may be increased by one foot for each
foot of additional setback above the minimum required, if adjacent to property zoned RS, RM (except RM-U), YR, AG, or
H, but in no case shall the structure be higher than fifty (50) feet. Heights may be increased according to the provisions of
Section 3-1.2(D) and (E). Height limits for the C District vary (see Section 2-1.5(B)(2)).
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter B, Article III
210

of Section 2-1.
5. The eighty percent (80%) limit applies only in Suburban Neighborhoods, per Section 2-1.3(D).
6. Side yards are not required, however any side yard provided adjacent to an interior lot line shall be not less than twelve (12)
feet in width. A space less than six (6) inches in width between an interior lot line and a building wall shall not be regarded
as a side yard.
7. Building setbacks shall be measured from either the existing street right-of-way, or the proposed right-of-way established
by the adopted Transportation Plan, whichever is most restrictive.
8. Whenever a lot in a nonresidential district other than the NB or NO Districts shares a common boundary line with a lot in a
residential district (except RM-U), YR, AG, or H District with no intervening street or highway, the lot in the nonresidential
district shall have a required setback along the shared boundary line of not less than forty (40) feet or shall have the required
setback for the nonresidential district, whichever is greater, unless the development conforms to the Land Use Plan and is a
Special Use District then a minimum setback of the Bufferyard (3-5 Bufferyard Standards) shall be considered for a setback.
9. Minimum zoning lot width for rear loading townhouse developments containing a variety of lot widths may be reduced to
sixteen (16) feet.

1. Minimum zoning lot width for rear loading townhouse developments containing a variety of lot widths may be reduced to
sixteen (16) feet.
3-1.2 SUPPLEMENTARY DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS
The following supplementary dimensional regulations shall apply to all buildings and structures not subject
to the general dimensional requirements of Section 3-1.1.
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter B, Article III
212
(A) STRUCTURES PERMITTED ABOVE HEIGHT LIMITS
The height limitations of Section 3-1.1 shall not apply to the following structures.
(1) Buildings used in support of agricultural operations;
(2) Chimneys, unoccupiable steeples, spires, flagpoles, cupolas, roof venting pipes, and
freestanding rooftop mechanical equipment (including unenclosed screening);
(3) Transmission towers;
(4) Water towers, observation towers, silos, and power transmission towers;
(5) Mixing plants, and screening or loading towers for sand or rock; and,
(6) Derricks and conveyors.
(B) STRUCTURES WHICH MAY ENCROACH INTO REQUIRED YARDS
The following structures may encroach into required yards as follows:
(1) Open Porches and above Grade Decks in front and rear yards. An open porch or
unenclosed above grade deck at or below the main living level of a single family dwelling
may project into a required front or rear yard not more than ten (10) feet, provided that
such projection does not reduce the remaining open portion of the yard to a depth of less
than fifteen (15) feet, or within a TND-S provided that such projection does not encroach
within a public right-of-way or easement.
(2) Bay Window. A bay window may project into any required front or rear yard not more
than three (3) feet.
(3) Architectural Features. Architectural features, such as sills, belt courses, and cornices,
may project into any required yard not more than one foot.
(4) Roof, Eave, Chimney, or Awning. A roof, eave, chimney, or awning may project into
any required yard not more than three (3) feet.
(5) Canopy. Canopies, either attached or detached, used in conjunction with retail uses in
business, office, or industrial districts, may project into a required front yard, provided that
such projection does not reduce the remaining open portion of such yard to a depth of less
than ten (10) feet, or within a TND-S provided that such projection does not encroach
within a public right-of-way or easement.
(6) Open Stairs. Open stairs to a second story of a residence may project into any required
side or rear yard but shall not encroach into the required front yard.
(7) Satellite Dishes. Satellite dishes greater than one (1) meter in diameter for residential use
and two (2) meters in diameter for commercial/industrial use shall meet the requirements
of accessory structures in required yards in Section 3-1.2(F).
(C) IMPROVEMENTS PERMITTED IN REQUIRED YARDS
The following improvements are permitted in required yards provided there is no interference with
any recorded sight easement.
(1) Landscape Features. Landscape features, including, but not limited to, ornamental pools,
planting boxes, sculpture, birdbaths, open terraces, walkways, handicapped ramps, walls,
or fences; and,
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter B, Article III
213
(2) Other Improvements. Other constructed improvements specifically exempted in the
definition of Structure, including, but not limited to, gate houses or bus shelters, mailboxes,
pump houses or wells, shelter for pets, playhouses, outdoor fireplaces, flagpoles,
underground fallout shelters not extending more than four (4) feet above grade, and
wharves unless otherwise regulated under Section 3-11.2. Air conditioning compressors
are exempted, subject to the provisions of Section 3-11.2.
(D) SETBACKS FOR TALLER STRUCTURES IN GO, CPO, GB, GI AND MU-S DISTRICTS
(1) Purpose. The purpose of setback standards for taller structures in these districts is to give
flexibility to nonresidential development while preventing structures significantly taller
than single family dwellings from being constructed in close proximity to such homes;
thereby maintaining the privacy and outdoor enjoyment typically provided in single family
districts and neighborhoods.
(2) Setback and Measurement. The height of any building may be increased above the
normal maximum by one foot for each foot of additional setback beyond the minimum
setback required if adjacent to property zoned RS, RM (except RM-U), or H. If adjacent
to other zoning districts, there is no height limit. Please refer to appropriate subsections in
Section 2-1.
(3) Exceptions. Buildings above the normal height maximums are not allowed in the
following situations:
(a) Where the proposed development is for single family detached, duplex, or twin
home uses; or,
(b) Where the proposed development involves redevelopment or change of use of an
existing site and does not increase the height or reduce the setback of the existing
primary structure closest to the single family use or district.
(E) SETBACKS FOR TALLER STRUCTURES IN THE C DISTRICT
(1) Purpose. The purpose of special setbacks for taller structures in the C District is to give
flexibility in designing and developing structures for these districts while at the same time
protecting residential development adjacent to the C District from the impacts on privacy
and outdoor enjoyment that structures built above the standard height limits might have.
(2) Exception From Height Limits. Existing buildings or buildings under construction on or
before April 15, 1991 shall be exempt from the height requirement.
(3) Setback and Measurement. No new building, or an addition to an existing building which
is exempt from the height requirement, shall exceed the normal maximum height of sixty
(60) feet allowed in the C District unless the building is set back at least forty (40) feet
from any property zoned RS, RM (except RM-U), or H. For each foot of setback from
property zoned RS, RM (except RM-U), or H beyond forty (40) feet, the maximum
permitted height of a building may be increased by one foot. If the building is set back at
least one hundred twenty (120) feet from all property zoned RS, RM (except RM-U), or H,
or is adjacent to other zoning districts, there is no height limit. Please refer to Section 2-
1.5(B).
(F) ACCESSORY STRUCTURES PERMITTED IN REQUIRED YARDS
(1) Interior Lots. An accessory structure seventeen (17) feet or less in height and structurally
detached from the principal structure on the zoning lot may be erected on any interior lot
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter B, Article III
214
in either the required side or rear yards, if no part of said structure is less than seventy-five
(75) feet from the front lot line nor less than three (3) feet from a side or rear lot line.
(2) Corner Lot. An accessory structure less than seventeen (17) feet in height and structurally
detached from the principal structure on the zoning lot may be erected on a corner lot,
provided that:
(a) Said structure shall be erected in the required side yard not abutting the street, and
no part of said structure is less than seventy-five (75) feet from the front line nor
less than three (3) feet from a side or rear lot line; or,
(b) Said structure shall be erected in the required rear yard and shall not project
beyond, or nearer to, the street than the front setback line of the district, as
extended, of the adjacent lot whose front yard abuts the corner lot in question.
(3) Height. For purposes of this section, the height shall be measured from the average grade
of the midpoint of the front wall to the ridge of the roof of the accessory building.
(G) SIZE LIMITS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES
(1) Maximum Area. Accessory structure may not exceed five percent (5%) of the actual size
of the zoning lot or the minimum permitted lot size of the zoning district, whichever is
smaller. However, an accessory structure up to five hundred seventy-six (576) square feet
in area shall be permitted in all districts.
(2) Board of Adjustment. Requests for structures containing greater area than prescribed in
(a) above may be considered under the special use permit process through the Board of

the principal building.
(I) SPECIAL YARD REQUIREMENTS FOR OLDER NEIGHBORHOODS
Alternative dimensional requirements are available for neighborhoods which were originally platted
or developed prior to February 3, 1970 and where at least fifty percent (50%) of the other lots on
the block in question are developed. See Section 3-8.
(J) SPECIAL YARD REQUIREMENTS WHERE NONRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS ADJOIN
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
Where a lot in a nonresidential district other than the NB, PB, LB, or NO Districts shares a common
boundary line with a lot in a residential district (except RM-U), YR, AG, or H District with no
intervening street or highway, the lot in the nonresidential district shall have a required setback
along the shared boundary line of not less than forty (40) feet or shall have the required setback for
the nonresidential district, whichever is greater, unless the development conforms to the Land Use
Plan and is a Special Use District then a minimum setback of the Bufferyard (3-5 Bufferyard
Standards) shall be considered for a setback.
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter B, Article III
215
(K) BUILDING SPACING REQUIREMENTS FOR MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL
BUILDINGS
If a zoning lot is developed for multifamily or townhouse residential buildings, the following method
shall be used to determine the minimum spacing of buildings. The spacing of buildings shall be
shown on a site plan prepared according to the provisions of Article VII.
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter B, Article III
216
(1) Calculation of Triangle. For yards exclusive of those on the project perimeter, each wall
of every dwelling shall have a minimum yard space in the shape of an imaginary isosceles
triangle. The base of said triangle shall be a line connecting the extreme ends of the wall
of the building and whose altitude shall be the length of the base line multiplied by a factor
related to the height of the dwelling as provided in Table 3.5 and illustrated in the
accompanying figure. There shall be a minimum distance of fifteen (15) feet between any
walls of one-story buildings and twenty (20) feet between two-story buildings. Any wall
over ten (10) feet long shall be treated as a separate wall.

triangles shall not overlap the yard space for any other wall of the same or any other
dwelling.
(3) Other Spacing Requirements.
The spacing between buildings with attached units and automobile parking, private streets,
and drives shall be provided as required in Section 2-5.57(H)(8).
(4) Alternative Compliance. A developer may propose spacing for buildings that varies from
the strict application of the provisions of the section in order to accommodate the unique
character of the site or to utilize innovative design. Application for alternative compliance
shall include a site plan following the requirements of Article VII and any additional
architectural plans, elevations, or perspective drawings to illustrate the proposed building
design and/or placement alternative. Alternative compliance shall be approved by the
Planning Board only upon a finding that the building architecture and site plan fulfills the
following criteria as well or better than would strict conformance with the requirements of
this Ordinance:
(a) The project provides adequate air and light to the development and surrounding
properties.
(b) Through the use of a variety of fenestration patterns, building facade offsets, roof
line treatments, and other architectural features, the perceived bulk, scale, and
length and width of the building is congruous with surrounding buildings.

in the applicable district.
(M) DOUBLE COUNTING OF YARD, LOT AREA, LOADING AREA OR PARKING AREA
No space which has been counted as part of a yard, lot area, parking area or loading area required
under this Ordinance for one building or use shall be counted to satisfy or comply with a yard, lot
area, loading area or parking area requirements for any other building or use, except where shared
parking is permitted in Section 3-3.5(B). The minimum required yards, lot area, parking area or
loading area for any building or use existing or under construction at the time of the passage of this
Ordinance shall not be encroached upon or counted to satisfy such requirements for any other
building or use, except as permitted in Section 3-3.5(B).
(N) WIDTH OF PRIVATE ACCESS EASEMENTS AND PRIVATE STREETS An access
easement, or private street, connecting a public street or highway to principal uses which depend
upon such easement for access, shall be not less than thirty (30) feet in width for two-way access
and shall be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds. Any use abutting such easement shall
be located on a zoning lot and shall comply with all dimensional requirements of the applicable

3-3.3 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR PARKING AREAS
(A) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
All parking areas shall meet the following design standards:
(1) Unobstructed Movement. Parking areas shall be designed to allow unobstructed
movement into and out of each parking space without interfering with fixed objects such
as lighting fixtures, dumpsters, signage, or vehicles.
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter B, Article III
245
(2) Access. Parking spaces shall be designed to have access from parking aisles and not
directly from public streets except as provided for in Section 3-3.5 of this Ordinance. In
multifamily, commercial or industrial developments that utilize private streets for access
to parking areas, parking may be provided along those private streets or private access
easements unless otherwise restricted by the Community Development Department or the
North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT).
(3) Maneuvering Area. Except for single family dwellings, twin homes, duplexes, and for
multifamily developments of four (4) dwelling units or less, all maneuvers associated with
parking and loading must occur in the off-street parking area or structure. Private alleys
may be used to conduct parking maneuvers.
(4) Internal Circulation. All parking areas shall be designed to provide for internal
circulation such that each parking space is accessible to all other parking spaces without
necessitating the use of a public street or alley.
(B) DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS
All parking areas shall be designed and constructed to meet minimum parking space dimensions,
aisle dimensions, and other standards shown in Table 3.9. Aisle widths for aisles composed of
combinations of different angles of parking shall be the widest aisle width required for any angle of
parking found on the entire aisle.

(A) DEDICATION OF RIGHT-OF-WAY WITH DENSITY TRANSFER
(1) Dedication. Whenever a tract of land is proposed for subdivision or for use pursuant to a
zoning or building permit, and a portion of it is located within a corridor for a street or
highway on a plan established and adopted pursuant to State law for a street or highway
that is included in the Department of Transportation's Transportation Improvement
Program, the right-of-way within that corridor shall be dedicated to the appropriate agency.
(2) Required Findings. No dedication of right-of-way shall be required pursuant to this
section unless the Planning Board or Elected Body granting final subdivision plat approval,
the special use permit, or other approval or permission finds prior to the grant that the
dedication does not result in the deprivation of a reasonable use of the original tract and
that the dedication is either reasonably related to the traffic generated by the proposed
subdivision or use of the remaining land or the impact of the dedication is mitigated by
measures provided in this Ordinance.
(3) Transfer of Density Credits. The applicant may transfer density credits attributable to
the dedicated right-of-way to contiguous land owned by the applicant. If the dedication of
right-of-way is not required, an applicant for subdivision plat approval on a zoning or
building permit, or any other permission pursuant to this Ordinance elects to dedicate the
right-of-way, the applicant may transfer density credits attributable to the dedicated rightof-
way to contiguous land that is part of a common development plan.
(4) Definition of Density Credit. As used in Section 3-7.1(A), the term density credit means
the potential for the improvement or subdivision of part or all of a parcel of real property,
as permitted by this Ordinance or the Subdivision Ordinance, as set forth in Section 3-
7.1(A).
(5) Transferable Percentage. One hundred percent (100%) of the density credit or
development potential of the property dedicated pursuant to Section 3-7.1(A) may be
transferred to contiguous land that is part of a common development plan as identified in
Section 3-7.1(A).
(B) TRANSPORTATION PLAN CORRIDORS
(1) Limits on Approvals. Whenever a tract of land is proposed for subdivision or for use
pursuant to a zoning or building permit, and a portion of it is located within a corridor for
a thoroughfare identified on the Transportation Plan, no building permit shall be issued
for any building or structure or part thereof located within the roadway corridor, nor shall
approval of a subdivision be granted with respect to property within the roadway corridor.
The City Traffic Engineer and/or the North Carolina Department of Transportation district
engineer shall be notified within ten (10) days of all such requests for building permits or
subdivision approvals within the roadway corridor.
(2) Exemptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to valid building permits issued
prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, or to building permits for buildings and
structures which existed prior to the filing of the roadway corridor, provided the size of the
building or structure is not increased and the type of building code occupancy as set forth
in the North Carolina Building Code is not changed. If, within one year following the
establishment of a roadway corridor official map or amendment, work shall not have begun
on an environmental impact statement or preliminary engineering, the corridor shall be
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter B, Article III
279
deemed abandoned, and the provisions of this section shall no longer apply to properties
or portions of properties located within the roadway corridor.
(3) Time Limits. No application for building permit issuance or subdivision plat approval
shall be delayed by the provisions of this section for more than three (3) years from the
date of the original building permit or subdivision plat submittal.
(4) Waiver of Requirements. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide requests to
waive the requirements of this section. A variance may be granted by the Board of
Adjustment upon a showing that:
(a) Even with the tax benefits provided as authorized by State Law, no reasonable
return may be earned from the land; and

hardships.
3-7.2 GREENWAYS
Before any zoning permit is approved for a lot which lies within fifty (50) feet of a stream identified for a
greenway in the adopted Greenway Plan, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the Town Manager. The
adopting jurisdiction will assess the potential impact of the development on future greenway construction
and may then offer to purchase or undertake other action to protect the potential greenway corridor. The
Zoning Administrator shall not approve any permit which would authorize disturbance of the potential
greenway corridor, nor shall the property owner or his/her agent disturb the potential greenway corridor, until
the Town Manager formally responds to the Zoning Administrator regarding the intent of the adopting
jurisdiction. If no response is received within fifteen (15) days, the Zoning Administrator may issue the

dimensional requirements established in the design review guidelines adopted for each
separate LHL. Design review guidelines are addressed in Section 4-7.5.

Reconstruction. In the event that the Commission finds that an application for a building
permit covers activity constituting an authentic restoration or reconstruction in the same
location as the original location and in the original conformation of the structure of historic

UDO. Any items restored, reconstructed, or maintained over, on, or within public
sidewalks, public alley areas, or other such public way shall be the responsibility of the

constitute the owners agreement to protect and hold the County/City/Town/Village
blameless against any and all liability, cost, damage, or expense suffered or sustained by
the County/City/Town/Village as a result of or growing out of the restoration,
reconstruction, or maintenance. Such items, so approved, may be lawfully restored,
reconstructed, or maintained. Any such item projecting over the street or alley shall be, at
its lowest point, twelve (12) feet above the travel way unless located in the H District. If
located in an H District see Section 4-6.1(C)(2). The provisions of this subsection shall

permitted parking spaces for the site and use. In no instance shall the structure's use be allowed to
convert to a more intense use as per the parking requirements of Section 3-3 without first meeting
the additional parking needs of the new use.

(A) Establishment
The Elected Bodies may designate one or more geographic areas as an H or HO District. The

(b) by property owners within an affected area;
(c) by a neighborhood group, association, or coalition;

preliminary consideration of the request to determine the eligibility of the general area
proposed to become an H or HO District.
(3) If the Commission determines by vote that said general area is ineligible to become an H
or HO District, the Commission shall report such determination to the appropriate Elected
Body. The Elected Body may accept the determination of the Commission, or it may direct
the Commission to proceed in accordance with this Article as if the Commission's
determination had been that said general area was eligible to become an H or HO District.
(4) If the Commission determines by vote that said general area is eligible to become an H or
HO District, it shall notify property owners within said general area, through first class
mail, that establishment of a designated historic district has been proposed and that the
formation of a task force to prepare a detailed study for such establishment will be
considered by the Commission at a specified date and time.
(5) The Commission may appoint a task force to develop design review guidelines and
boundaries for said general area. The task force shall be composed primarily of individuals
representing various interests in said general area.
(6) After developing design review guidelines and boundaries, the task force shall report to the
Unified Development Ordinance 294 Chapter B, Article IV
Commission.
(7) The Commission shall review the design review guidelines and boundaries and shall then
vote on whether to accept the task force report.

features, sites, or surroundings.
(12) The North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources shall submit an analysis of, and
recommendations concerning, the report described in Section 4-5.3(A)(11) above to the
Elected Body. Failure of the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources to submit
written analysis and recommendations to the Elected Body within thirty (30) calendar days
after a written request for such analysis has been received by the Department of Cultural
Resources shall relieve the County/City/Town/Village of any responsibility for awaiting
such analysis, and the Elected Body may at any time thereafter take any necessary action
to adopt or amend its zoning ordinance.
(13) Once all the previous procedural steps have been met, an application for rezoning the said
general area to an H or HO District shall be accepted. The County/City/Town/Village shall
proceed in the same manner as would otherwise be required for a change in the Zoning
Ordinance and the request shall be processed according to the procedures set forth in

District for which a task force has been previously appointed to study said general area and
has submitted a report to the Commission.

recommendations concerning the report described in Section 4-5.3(B)(1) above to the
Elected Body. Failure of the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources to submit
written analysis and recommendations to the Elected Body within thirty (30) calendar days
after a written request for such analysis has been received by the Department of Cultural
Resources shall relieve the Town of any responsibility for awaiting such analysis, and the
Elected Body may at any time thereafter take any necessary action to adopt or amend its
zoning ordinance.
(3) Once all the previous procedural steps have been met, an application to amend, supplement,
change, modify, or repeal any district boundaries of the H or HO Districts shall be accepted.
The Town shall proceed in the same manner as would otherwise be required for a change
in the Zoning Ordinance and the request shall be processed according to the procedures set

Any items restored, reconstructed, or maintained over, on, or within public sidewalks,

owner's restoration, reconstruction, or maintenance of any such item shall constitute the
owner's agreement to protect and hold the County/City/Town/Village blameless against
any and all liability, cost, damage, or expense suffered or sustained by the
County/City/Town/Village as a result of or growing out of the restoration, reconstruction,
or maintenance. Such items, so approved, may be lawfully restored, reconstructed, or

nonresidential districts, whether by right or as a special use, shall be permitted in the HO District
according to the procedures established for such uses.
(B) DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS
(1) Requirements. All buildings and structures in the HO Districts shall comply with the

location as the original location and in the original conformation of the structure of historic
and/or architectural significance to the HO District, said building or structure may be
restored or reconstructed without compliance with dimensional requirements in Section 3-
1 of the UDO.
Any items restored, reconstructed, or maintained over, on, or within public sidewalks,
public alley areas, or other such public way shall be the responsibility of the owner. The
owner's restoration, reconstruction, or maintenance of any such item shall constitute the
owner's agreement to protect and hold the County/City/Town/Village blameless against
any and all liability, cost, damage, or expense suffered or sustained by the
County/City/Town/Village as a result of or growing out of the restoration, reconstruction,
or maintenance. Such items, so approved, may be lawfully restored, reconstructed, or

(C) NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND IMPROVEMENTS
In the H Districts, any habitable structure existing prior to December 31, 1994 shall be exempt from
the current dimensional requirements in Sections 3-1 and 3-3 of the UDO, which includes off-street
parking requirements. Such exemptions shall be based upon the structure's use as of December 31,
1994, which includes the number of required parking spaces for the site and use. In no instance shall
the structure's use be allowed to convert to a more intense use as per the parking requirements of
Section 3-3 without first meeting the additional parking needs of the new use.
(D) PARKING VARIANCE
Where the Commission, in considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, finds that
the number of off-street parking spaces required by this Ordinance for a building or structure within
an H or HO District or a designated Local Historic Landmark would render the building incongruous
with the historic aspects of the designated district, it may recommend to the Board of Adjustment a
variance, in part or in whole, of the off-street parking requirements. The Board of Adjustment may
authorize a lesser number of off-street parking spaces, provided:
(1) The Board of Adjustment finds that the lesser number of off-street parking spaces will not
create problems due to increased on-street parking; and,
(2) The Board of Adjustment finds that the lesser number of off-street parking spaces will not
constitute a threat to the public safety.

the project is in compliance with the Design Review Guidelines either through consultation with Commission
staff or review of the appropriate Design Review Guidelines.
The City/County/Town/Village shall require a Certificate of Appropriateness to be issued by the Commission
prior to the issuance of a building permit or other permit granted for the purposes of constructing, altering,
moving, or demolishing structures, which Certificate may be issued subject to reasonable conditions
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance.
If a Certificate of Appropriateness is required, then the applicant shall be provided with an application form
and instructions. Certificates of Appropriateness shall be issued or denied in accordance with the Standards
for Review found in Section 4-7.5.
A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be issued prior to any application for a building permit being made.

4-7.4 PROCEDURES
The following procedures shall govern the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness.
(A) APPLICATIONS
Application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be submitted to Commission staff on forms
provided. The Commission shall, in its Rules of Procedure, require such data and information as is
reasonably necessary to evaluate the nature of the application. An application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness shall not be considered complete until all required information has been submitted.
For properties within H and HO Districts, the names and mailing addresses of the property owners
filing the application and the names and addresses of the property owners within one hundred (100)
feet on all sides of the property which is the subject of the application must also be filed.
(B) APPLICATION TO HISTORIC RESOURCES COMMISSION
Commission staff shall transmit the Certificate of Appropriateness application, together with the
supporting information and material, to the Commission for consideration.
(C) NOTICE AND HEARING WITHIN H AND HO DISTRICTS
Commission staff will make a reasonable attempt to identify and notify by mail the owners of any
property located within one hundred (100) feet on all sides of the property which is the subject of
the application. Prior to issuance or denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Commission
shall give the applicant and other property owners and/or residents likely to be affected by the
application an opportunity to be heard.
(D) VIEWING SITE
As part of its review procedure, the Commission may, solely in performance of its official duties
and only at reasonable times, enter upon private lands to view the premises. However, no member,
employee, or agent of the Commission may enter any private building or structure without the
express permission of the owner or occupant thereof. Additionally, the Commission may seek the
advice of the North Carolina Division of Archives and History or such other expert advice as the
Commission may deem necessary.
(E) TIME FOR ACTION
The Commission shall act upon complete applications within one-hundred-twenty (120) calendar
days after the filing, unless an extension of time has been mutually agreed upon between the
Commission and the applicant. Otherwise, failure to act upon a complete application shall be
deemed to constitute approval and a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be issued.
(F) FORM OF DECISION
All formal actions of the Commission shall be set forth in writing. A decision of the Commission
shall be effective upon filing the written decision with the Historic Preservation Officer of the
Commission. The decision of the Commission shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic
Unified Development Ordinance 300 Chapter B, Article IV
mail, or by first-class mail to the applicant, property owner, and to any person who has submitted a
written request for a copy, prior to the date the decision becomes effective. The person required to
provide notice shall certify that proper notice has been made.
(G) TIME LIMITS
Unless otherwise designated by the Commission, all work approved under a Certificate of
Appropriateness shall be completed within three (3) years of the effective date of the Certificate of
Appropriateness. Is a request is made to renew a Certificate of Appropriateness prior to its
expiration, Commission staff may renew it for one (1) additional years. If the work approved under
a Certificate of Appropriateness has not been completed within the designated time period, the
Certificate of Appropriateness shall expire.
(H) APPROVAL OF MINOR WORKS
The Commission may delegate to Commission staff the review and approval of minor works for the
Local Historic Landmarks (LHL), and for the Historic (H) and Historic Overlay (HO) Districts after
approval of Design Review Guidelines for the Local Historic Landmarks (LHL) and each Historic
(H) and Historic Overlay (HO) District. Minor works are defined as projects which do not involve
substantial alterations, additions, or removals that could impair the integrity of an historic landmark,
property, and/or a district as a whole or be incongruous with the special character of an historic
landmark, property, or district. Minor works require a Certificate of Appropriateness. A minor
works application may be filed at any time and no public notification is required for review of a
minor work application. No minor works application may be denied by Commission staff. If
Commission staff cannot approve a minor works application, it shall be presented to the Commission
for review and formal action.
(I) REAPPLICATION AFTER DENIAL
If the Commission determines that a Certificate of Appropriateness should not be issued, a new
application affecting the same property may be submitted only if substantial change is made in the
application, or if conditions related to the Local Historic Landmark (LHL) or H or HO District or
surrounding uses have changed. A reconsidered application shall be treated as a new application.
(J) DEMOLITION PERMITS
An application for a Certificate of Appropriateness authorizing the relocation or demolition of a
designated historic landmark or building or structure within an H or HO District may not be denied;
however, the effective date of such Certificate may be delayed for not more than three hundred and
sixty-five (365) calendar days from the date of approval. The maximum delay may be reduced by
the Commission when it finds that delay would impose an extreme hardship on the owner or would
permanently deprive the owner of all beneficial use or return from such property from such delay.
During the period of delay, the Commission may negotiate with the owner and other parties in an
effort to preserve the building or structure. If the Commission finds that the building or structure
has no particular significance or value toward maintaining the character of the designated landmark
or district, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal.
(K) APPLICABILITY TO COUNTY, CITY, TOWN, VILLAGE AND UTILITY COMPANIES
The County/City/Town/Village and all public utility companies shall be required to obtain a
Certificate of Appropriateness prior to initiating on a Local Historic Landmark (LHL) or in an H or
HO District any changes in the character of street paving, sidewalks, trees, utility installations, walls,
lighting, fences, structures, and buildings on property, easements, or streets owned or franchised by
the County/City/Town/Village or public utility companies.
(L) APPEALS
An appeal of a decision of the Commission in granting or denying any Certificate of Appropriateness
shall be taken to the appropriate Board of Adjustment. Appeals shall be taken by any aggrieved
party by the later of thirty (30) calendar days after the decision is effective or after a written copy
thereof is delivered in accordance with Paragraph (F) above, and shall be in the nature of certiorari
(only evidence presented at the Commission's meeting shall be considered at the appeal). Appeal
Unified Development Ordinance 301 Chapter B, Article IV
from the decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be to the Forsyth County Superior Court.
(M) INSPECTION AFTER ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE
The Zoning Administrator shall from time to time inspect the construction or alteration approved
by a Certificate of Appropriateness and report to the Commission any work not in conformance with
the Certificate of Appropriateness.
4-7.4.1 AFTER-THE-FACT CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS
(A) After-the-Fact Certificate of Appropriateness Applications
An after-the-fact Certificate of Appropriateness application includes any major or minor work
projects that have been initiated or completed prior to obtaining the required Certificate of
Appropriateness.
(B) After-the-fact Certificate of Appropriateness Application Fee
To discourage activity without a Certificate of Appropriateness and to assist in offsetting the costs
associated with the additional staff work that accompanies an after-the-fact application, an
escalating fee system has been implemented. The escalating fee system is based upon the number
of after-the-fact Certificate of Appropriateness applications sought by or on behalf of the property
owner. The after-the-fact Certificate of Appropriateness application fee, as established by the Board
of Aldermen of the Town of Kernersville and the County Commissioners of Forsyth County, shall
be due upon submission of the application.
(C) Application Consideration
All after-the-fact Certificate of Appropriateness applications shall be brought before the
Commission for consideration.
(D) Approval of After-the-Fact Certificate of Appropriateness Applications
Unless otherwise designated by the Commission, if an after-the-fact Certificate of Appropriateness
application is approved, the applicant shall have (90) days to complete the approved work.
(E) Denial of After-the-Fact Certificate of Appropriateness Applications
If an after-the-fact application for approval of work, completed without a Certificate of
Appropriateness, receives a denial from the Commission, the subsequent Certificate of
Appropriateness application, if required, shall be considered anew. A subsequent Certificate of
Appropriateness application must be submitted to the Commission within thirty (30) days of the
effective date of the denial of the original after-the-fact application. Commission staff shall
determine if the subsequent application qualifies as a major or minor work and said application shall
be reviewed accordingly.
4-7.5 STANDARDS FOR REVIEW
A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be issued or denied in accordance with the following standards.
(A) GENERAL CRITERIA
In granting a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Commission shall take into account the historic or
architectural significance of the property under consideration and the exterior and interior (where
applicable), form and appearance of any proposed additions or modifications to a structure. The
Commission shall not consider interior arrangement in H and HO Districts.
(B) GENERAL RESTRICTION ON DENIAL
The Commission shall not refuse to issue a Certificate of Appropriateness except for the purpose of
preventing the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or moving of buildings,
structures, appurtenant features, or outdoor advertising signs which would be incompatible with the
Design Review Guidelines.
Unified Development Ordinance 302 Chapter B, Article IV
(C) DESIGN REVIEW GUIDELINES REQUIRED
The requirement for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall not become effective until after the
Commission has prepared and adopted principles and guidelines not inconsistent with Part 3C of
Article 19 of Chapter 160A of the NCGS. Such principles and guidelines, hereafter referred to as
Design Review Guidelines, shall be prepared for the Local Historic Landmarks (LHL), and for each
H and/or HO District and shall address new construction, alterations, additions, moving, and
demolition to properties and/or sites. These criteria shall take into account the historic, architectural,
and visual elements which are unique to the designated landmarks and districts.
(D) DESIGN REVIEW GUIDELINES AMENDMENT
Prior to the amendment of design review guidelines for the Local Historic Landmarks (LHL) or any
H or HO District, any person may comment upon the proposal. Not less than forty-five (45) days
prior to the public hearing at which the Commission proposes to act upon the amendment(s), copies
of the proposed amendment(s) shall be made available to the Elected Bodies, and any other
interested person upon request. Concurrently, the Commission shall cause notice of the public
hearing at which the proposed amendment(s) will be considered for adoption to be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in Winston-Salem.
4-8 COMPLIANCE
Compliance with the provisions of this section shall be enforced by the appropriate Zoning Administrator.
Failure to comply with this Section and provisions of a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be unlawful and
a violation of the Zoning Ordinance, and all remedies authorized by law for noncompliance with this
Ordinance may be exercised to enforce this section.

CHAPTER B - ZONING ORDINANCE
ARTICLE V - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
5-1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Chapter is to regulate and limit the continued existence of nonconforming uses,
nonconforming lots, and nonconforming structures, buildings and improvements. Nothing in this section
shall limit the right of any person, firm, or corporation to complete construction of any project or use of any
property, pursuant to a valid building permit or a special use permit approved by an Elected Body, which
permit or site plan was in effect upon the effective date of this Ordinance.
5-2 NONCONFORMING US ES
5-2.1 APPLICABILITY

Any use of land or a building is considered nonconforming if:
(1) Not Permitted in Zoning District. The use is not permitted in the zoning district in which
it is located; and,
(2) Existed as of Effective Date. The use existed on May 8, 1968 and continues to exist, the
use legally existed as of the effective date of this Ordinance, or the use legally existed as
of the effective date of subsequent amendments thereto.
(B) H STDRIICT
In any H District, the provision of this section shall not apply. Regulations governing
nonconforming uses in the H District are contained in Article IV of this Ordinance.
5-2.2 CONTINUATION
Nonconforming uses as defined above in Section 5-2.1(A) may continue under the provisions of this Article,
except as provided in Sections 5-2.8 and 5-2.9 below.
5-2.3 EXPANSION OF A NONCONFORMING USE
(A) PURPOSE
The purpose of the following requirements is to authorize a limited expansion of nonconforming
uses.
(B) SPECIAL USE PERMIT
A special use permit from the Board of Adjustment is required for any expansion of a
nonconforming use. Application shall be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 6-
1.4.
(C) INTERNAL EXPANSION OF A NONCONFORMING USE
Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout the same building; provided, however, that
the building itself may not be enlarged or expanded. The nonconforming use may not be extended
into any other building not already being used for the nonconforming use; nor may the
nonconforming use be moved completely from one building into any other building not already
being used for the nonconforming use.
(D) EXTERNAL EXPANSION INCLUDING DEMOLITION AND EXPANDED
RECONSTRUCTION
Except with respect to those uses specified in Sections 5-2.3(D)(6) and 5-2.9 below, the Board of
Adjustment shall have authority to issue a special use permit for the expansion, which may include
demolition and expanded reconstruction, of a building which contains a nonconforming use or the
expansion of a nonconforming use of open land; provided, under the following circumstances, the
Unified Development Ordinances Chapter B, Article V
306
following limitations, conditions, and provisions are met:
(1) Expansion Limitations. No expansion, with or without demolition and reconstruction, of
a building which contains a nonconforming use, shall be permitted which would result in
any increase in the size of the building in excess of:
(a) Twenty-five percent (25%) of the floor area lawfully existing as of the effective
date establishing the nonconforming status of the use; or,
(b) Twenty-five percent (25%) of the cubical content of the building lawfully
existing as of the effective date of establishing the nonconforming status of the
use.
There shall be only one such expansion permitted, regardless of the size of the expansion.
(2) Unenclosed Canopy. The intent of this section is to permit one expansion of a canopy in
addition to one expansion of the structure. Where the proposed expansion consists of the
construction of an unenclosed canopy at a service station, drive-through bank, or other
similar use, said canopy shall not be limited to the twenty-five percent (25%) of floor area
standard referred to herein, but shall be limited to an expansion of three (3) times the
enclosed floor area of the structure which lawfully existed at 12:01 A.M. on the effective
date of this Ordinance or September 16, 1968, whichever is applicable; provided the
expansion shall not exceed one thousand (1,000) square feet. The unenclosed canopy shall
not later be enclosed.
(3) Increase in Land Area. No expansion of a nonconforming use of open land shall be
permitted which would result in any increase in the land area of such nonconforming use
in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) of the land area of such nonconforming use lawfully
existing as of the effective date of this Ordinance or September 16, 1968, whichever is
applicable. There shall be only one such expansion.
(4) Expansion onto Lot Not Currently Used for Nonconforming Use. No expansion of
either a building which contains a nonconforming use or a nonconforming use of open land
may extend onto any lot no part of which is being used for the nonconforming use proposed
for expansion.
(5) Burden of Proof. Each applicant for a special use permit to expand a building which
contains a nonconforming use and/or to expand a nonconforming use of open land shall
have the burden of proving the floor area and cubical content of the building and/or the
land area occupied by the nonconforming use to which the application applies, as it
lawfully existed as of the effective date establishing the nonconforming status of the use.
(6) Nonconforming Uses Which May Not Be Expanded. The following uses, if they are or
become nonconforming by virtue of the adoption of this Ordinance or subsequent
amendments, may not be expanded:
(a) Motor Vehicle Dismantling and Wrecking Yard;
(b) Building Materials Supply;
(c) Implement Sales and Service;
(d) Storage and Salvage Yard; or,
(e) Signs.
(7) Prohibitions on Variances. The Board of Adjustment may not grant variances of any
yard requirements, off-street parking requirements, or any other applicable provisions of
the Zoning Ordinance to allow for the expansion of a nonconforming use.

307
(E) CO-LOCATION ON TRANSMISSION TOWERS
(1) Co-location Permitted. There shall be no limitation as to the number of such additional
antennae and ground buildings at existing nonconforming transmission tower sites as long
as the co-location does not increase the existing fenced in area on the ground for the tower
and equipment. Any increase in the fenced in ground area must be approved by a Special
Use Permit from the Board of Adjustment and shall be subject to the expansion limitations
set forth in Section 5-2.3 of this Ordinance.
(2) Additional Buildings and Equipment. All additional buildings and equipment must
comply with the setback, buffering, and other requirements of Section 2-5.72, the use
conditions for transmission towers.
(3) Existing Improvements. Prior to granting any permits for co-location on a transmission
tower site, the current fencing, signage, bufferyard, and control of land provisions of
Section 2-5.72 must be met, except that where the size of the site, the existing location of
improvements currently on the site, or other physical features of the site or adjacent
property prevent the applicant from complying with the full dimensional requirements of
the Ordinance, then Community Development staff may approve a site plan which attempts
to meet the intent of the Ordinance but does not meet the full requirements of the use
conditions (such as a reduced width of a bufferyard, use of fencing in lieu of some or all
plant material, or use of adjacent property for part or all of the bufferyard). The width and
condition of access easements must also be reviewed and approved.
(4) Height. No co-location proposed under this section shall result in a substantial
modification.
(5) Structural Integrity. Prior to issuance of any permits approving a co-location, written
verification certifying that the host tower is structurally and mechanically capable of
supporting the proposed additional antenna or configuration of antennae must be submitted
by a qualified engineer.
(F) CONDITIONS
In approving an application for the issuance of a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment may
impose additional reasonable and appropriate conditions and safeguards to protect the public health
and safety, the value of neighborhood properties, and the health and safety of neighboring residents.
Among other things, the Board of Adjustment may include in the permit conditions or restrictions
to insure that the permitted expansion will not result in a change from the existing nonconforming
use to another nonconforming use. If the Board of Adjustment denies the application for the
issuance of a special use permit, it shall enter the reasons for the denial in the minutes of the meeting
at which the action was taken.
(G) FAILURE TO COMPLY
Any special use permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become void as
specified in Section 5-2.3(H) below for failure to comply with any conditions or restrictions which
are incorporated in or made a part of the permit.

The Board of Adjustment may authorize the conversion of a nonconforming use to another use
which, in the judgment of the Board of Adjustment, is less intensive in character or is essentially of
the same character as the original nonconforming use, except that no nonconforming use shall be
changed to any of the following uses:
(1) Motor Vehicle Dismantling and Wrecking Yard;
(2) Building Materials Supply;
(3) Implement Sales and Service;
(4) Storage and Salvage Yard; or,

to the Elected Body regarding zoning and land use matters as required by this Ordinance. The Zoning
Administrator shall enforce and administer the regulations of this Ordinance, under the general direction of
the manager of the adopting jurisdiction, and shall serve as secretary to the Board of Adjustment. The Board
of Adjustment or the Zoning Administrator may seek needed legal advice of the attorney for the adopting
jurisdiction.
6-1.2 ZONING ADMINISTRATOR
To ensure compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator shall:

Issue the following documents:
(1) Zoning Permit

Administrator prior to the following:
(i) Building or Structure. The construction, reconstruction, erection,
enlargement, relocation, or structural alteration of any building or
structure or part thereof, including any principal use permitted in Table
2.6, Accessory Uses (Section 2-6), Sign Regulations (Section 3-2), or
any other use or improvement which requires a permit.
(ii) Change of Use. Any change of use of any building or land.
(b) Application. An application for a zoning permit shall be made to the Zoning
Administrator by the owner or his authorized agent and shall include a statement
as to the intended use of the building or land. Any such application shall be
accompanied by a plan so dimensioned or annotated as to show the proposed
building and existing buildings, if any, in exact relation to lot lines. The water
supply and sewage disposal methods of the proposed development shall have prior
approval in compliance with Section 3-10 of this Ordinance.
(c) Building Permit Serves as Zoning Permit. A building permit issued in
accordance with the State Building Code shall serve also as a zoning permit, and
in such cases the cost of the building permit shall be the only fee charged. A
minimum fee as specified in Article VIII shall be charged for any zoning permit
issued that does not require a building permit.
(d) Posting. Any person performing the work covered by a zoning permit shall post
said permit on the premises before the work begins and shall keep such permit
posted on the premises until the certificate of occupancy for the premises is issued.
Any time limitation relating to appeals from the issuance of a building permit shall
run from the date the building permit is posted on the premises. The party to
whom the building permit is issued shall be furnished a copy of the permit on
Unified Development Ordinance 314 Chapter B Article VI
which such person may certify as to the date of the posting of the permit, and
return such certificate to the Zoning Administrator. The date certified to the
Zoning Administrator as the date of posting shall be the date from which any time

within one year of issuance or renewed after written application. For any
development approval that is current and valid at any point during the period
beginning January 1, 2008, and ending December 31, 2011, the running of the
period of the development approval and any associated vested right under G.S.

be revocable should any of the conditions under which it is issued not be complied
with.

occupancy withheld, in order to compel compliance with a permit or ordinance
on another property.
(2) Certificate of Occupancy. A certificate of occupancy shall be issued by the Zoning
Administrator upon approval of any building or other structure, or approval of other
preparations for site occupancy, if the requirements of this Ordinance and other applicable
laws or codes are complied with. Occupancy of such building or site prior to the issuance
of the certificate of occupancy is a violation subject to the provisions of Article IX of this
Ordinance.

unless accompanied by an application for a certificate of occupancy. Both
applications shall include a statement of the intended use of the building or land.

inspected, the appropriate inspector shall so certify on the application for
certificate of occupancy.
(3) Permits Requiring Site Plan Review by the Planning Board. Whenever the Planning
Board approves a use requiring site plan review pursuant to Section 6-1.3, the Zoning
Administrator shall issue any necessary building permit and certificate of occupancy in
accordance with the terms of such approval. All other conditions are to be met prior to the
issuance of building permits, certificates of occupancy, or other period of time as
determined by the Zoning Administrator.
(4) Special Use Permits, Variances and Special Use District Zoning. Whenever the
authorized board approves an application for a special use permit or a variance pursuant to
Section 6-1.4 or 6-1.5, or as a special use district zoning pursuant to Section 6-2.2, the
Zoning Administrator shall issue any necessary building permit and certificate of
occupancy in accordance with the terms of such approval. All other conditions are to be
met prior to the issuance of building permits, certificates of occupancy, or other period of
time as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
(5) Temporary Use Permits. Temporary use permits shall be issued or renewed by the
Zoning Administrator in compliance with Section 2-7, provided that such permits are
Unified Development Ordinance 315 Chapter B Article VI
issued only upon written agreement by the owner to remove the structures or uses upon
expiration of the permit.
(a) Application. All applications for temporary use permits shall be made to the
Zoning Administrator by the owner or his authorized agent;

Administrator shall determine that all other pertinent regulations which may apply
to such proposed use are complied with.

certificate of appropriateness as required in the H and HO Districts, the Zoning
Administrator shall issue any necessary building permit and certificate of occupancy in
accordance with the terms of such approval.

6-1.4 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT
(A) SPECIAL USE PERMITS AUTHORIZED BY THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT
(1) Board of Adjustment Review. The Board of Adjustment shall review all requests for
permits as designated in Table 2.6 and Section 2-5.
(2) Planning Board Report. Applications for special use permits may be approved by the
Board of Adjustment after such board receives a report from the Planning Board and holds
a duly advertised public hearing in each case, except that the Planning Board shall not be
required to review and report on applications for:

(b) Kennels;
Unified Development Ordinance 317 Chapter B Article VI
(c) Shooting Ranges;
(d) Manufactured Homes Not in Manufactured Housing Developments;
(e) Expansion or Conversion of a Nonconforming Use;

(g) Accessory Structures; or
(h) Parking reductions for churches
The Planning Board shall submit its report in writing to the Zoning Administrator not more
than sixty (60) days after receipt of the application in accordance with established review
procedures. In reviewing the request, the Planning Board shall review the application to
assure compliance with all provisions of this Ordinance. The Planning Board report shall
make a finding that the application as submitted either complies with the Ordinance,
complies with recommended conditions, or does not comply with the Ordinance. If the
Planning Board recommends conditions, the Planning Board shall have the authority to
recommend conditions as identified in Section 6-1.3(A)(1) to reduce impacts associated
with the project.
(3) Required Findings. The Board of Adjustment shall issue a special use permit only when
the Board of Adjustment makes an affirmative finding as follows:
(a) That the use will not materially endanger the public health or safety if located
where proposed and developed according to the application and plan as submitted
and approved;
(b) That the use meets all required conditions and specifications;
(c) That the use will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting
property, or that the use is a public necessity; and,
(d) That the location and character of the use, if developed according to the
application and plan submitted and approved, will be in harmony with the area in
which it is to be located and in general conformity with the Kernersville
Development Plan.
Except with regard to the conversion of nonconforming uses in Section 5-2, no provision
of this Ordinance shall be interpreted as conferring upon the Board of Adjustment the
authority to approve an application for a special use permit for any use unless authorized
in Table 2.6. In approving an application for the issuance of a special use permit, the Board
of Adjustment may impose additional reasonable and appropriate conditions and
safeguards to protect the public health and safety, and the value of neighboring properties,
and the health and safety of neighboring residents. If the Board of Adjustment denies the
application for the issuance of a special use permit, it shall enter the reasons for denial in
the minutes of the meeting at which the action was taken.
(4) Extension of Permit. A letter requesting an extension of time and indicating the reason
for such request, submitted prior to the termination date and duly approved by the Board
of Adjustment, shall extend the validity of such permit for a period of six (6) months. No
other extension of time shall be granted.
(5) Review of Request for Extension. In considering such extension, the Board of
Adjustment may make such changes in the conditions under which the permit was granted
as may be indicated by any new information relating to the property or to the use proposed
thereon, provided the extension or changes still comply with the affirmative finding set
forth above.
Unified Development Ordinance 318 Chapter B Article VI
(6) Special Use District Zoning. No separate special use permit is required for a use which
is permitted as a part of a special use district zoning adopted by the Elected Body and which
meets the requirements of this Ordinance.
(B) VARIANCES
(1) Authority. No provision of this Ordinance shall be interpreted as conferring upon the
Board of Adjustment the authority to approve an application for a variance of the
conditions of a permitted use except with respect to the specific waiving of requirements
as to:
(a) General Dimensions Requirements for Zoning Districts listed in Sections 2-1.2,
2-1.3, 2-1.4 and 2-1.5 of this Ordinance and shall only include minimum zoning
lot area and width, minimum setbacks, maximum impervious surface cover, or
maximum height;
(b) Floodplain reconstruction as specified in Chapter C of the Unified Development
Ordinances;
(c) Vehicular use landscaping requirements as specified in Section 3-4;
(d) Bufferyard requirements as specified in Section 3-5;
(e) Setback and landscaping requirements of the TO District as specified in Section
2-1.6(B).
(f) Width of private access easements where such easement is for single family
residential uses and where said private access easement was established prior to
April 17, 1978; and
(g) Delay of building permits within designated Transportation Plan corridors as
specified in Section 3-7.1.
(2) Limitations. The Board of Adjustment shall not grant a variance to permit a use not
permitted in the applicable zoning district, nor shall it grant a variance for a site plan feature
or condition adopted in conjunction with a special use district zoning.
(3) Public Hearing. Applications for variances may be approved by the Board of Adjustment
after such Board of Adjustment holds a duly advertised public hearing in each case.
(4) Hardship. When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of
a zoning ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the
ordinance upon a showing of all of the following:
(a) The unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the
ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of
a variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property;
(b) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as
location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances,
as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the
neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance;
(c) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property
owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances
Unified Development Ordinance 319 Chapter B Article VI
exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a selfcreated
hardship; and
(d) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the
ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is
achieved.
(5) Review of Applications. Any such variance shall observe the spirit and purpose of this
Ordinance and shall be granted only with reference to conditions and circumstances
peculiar to the property involved. If the Board of Adjustment denies the application for a
variance, it shall enter the reasons for the denial in the minutes of the meeting at which the
action was taken.
(6) Conditions. Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the
conditions are reasonably related to the variance.
(7) Voting on Variance Requests. The concurring vote of four-fifths (4/5) of the board shall
be necessary to grant a variance. For the purposes of this subsection, vacant positions on
the board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall
not be considered members of the board for calculation of the requisite majority if there
are no qualified alternatives to take the place of such members.
(C) PROCEDURE TO BE USED IN PROCESSING SPECIAL USE PERMIT, AND VARIANCE
REQUESTS AUTHORIZED BY THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT
(1) Application. Applications for special use permits or variances to be considered in any
month by the Board of Adjustment shall be made by the property owner or the owner's
authorized agent to the Zoning Administrator not less than twenty-four (24) days prior to
the established meeting date of that month. Each petition shall be accompanied by a fee as
authorized in Article VIII.
(2) Posted Notice of Hearing. The applicant shall post on the property a notice of public
hearing at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the hearing before the Board of
Adjustment.
Such notice shall be of sufficient size to contain, and shall contain, heavy black lettering
not less than three (3) inches high on a white background and shall be posted in a
conspicuous place on the premises. Where such posting is not clearly visible from the
nearest public right-of-way, a second directional sign which is clearly visible from the
nearest public right-of-way shall be posted. A sign shall be provided by the Zoning
Administrator consistent with these requirements. Such sign structure shall be removed by
the applicant within thirty (30) days after said public hearing.
(3) Mailed Notice of Hearing. Notice of hearings shall be mailed to the person or entity whose
appeal, application or request is the subject of the public hearing; to the owner of the
property that is subject to the public hearing, if different from the applicant; to the owners
of all parcels of land abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing; and to
any other person entitled to receive notice as otherwise provided in the Unified
Development Ordinances. The County Tax listing shall be utilized to determine the owners
entitled to receive mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least ten (10),
but not more than twenty-five (25) days, prior to the date of the hearing.
(4) Voting on Special Use Permits and Variance Requests. The concurring vote of fourfifths
(4/5) of the board shall be necessary to grant a variance. A majority of the members
shall be required to issue a Special Use Permit. For the purposes of this subsection, vacant
Unified Development Ordinance 320 Chapter B Article VI
positions on the board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial
matter shall not be considered members of the board for calculation of the requisite
majority if there are no qualified alternatives to take the place of such members.
(D) APPEALS AND INTERPRETATIONS
(1) General. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and pass upon appeals from and shall review
any decision made by the Zoning Administrator or his/her designee. The Board of
Adjustment shall also hear and pass upon all other matters upon which it is required to act
under this Ordinance. The appeal request is subject to the following:
(a) Only written decisions or determinations shall be appealed. A decision includes
any final and binding order, requirement or determination. The Zoning
Administrator or his or her designee shall give written notice to the owner of the
property that is subject of the decision and to the party who sought the decision,
if different from the owner. The written notice shall be delivered by personal
delivery, electronic mail or by first class mail.
(b) The owner or other party receiving the written notice shall have thirty (30) days
from receipt of the written notice, decision or determination to file an appeal. Any
other person or party with standing to appeal shall have thirty (30) days from
receipt of any source of actual or constructive notice of the decision or
determination to file an appeal. It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons
with standing to appeal have constructive notice of the decision from the date
the landowner or applicant posts a sign on the property using six inch (6
) letters with the words ZONING DECISION or SUBDIVISION
DECISION along with information identifying the means to contact an official
for information about the decision in a prominent location on the property for at
least ten (10) days. Posting of such signs is not the only form of constructive
notice. Verification of the posting shall be provided by the owner or applicant to
the official who made the decision.
(c) The Zoning Administrator or his/her designee shall transmit to the Board of
Adjustment all documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from is taken. The Zoning Administrator or his/her designee shall
also provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property
that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.
(d) An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement action stays enforcement
of the action appealed from unless the official who made the decision certified to
the Board of Adjustment after notice of appeal has been filed that because facts
stated in the affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or
because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with
enforcement of the ordinance. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be
stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If
enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the official a
request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board of Adjustment shall
meet to hear the appeal within fifteen (15) days after such request is filed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or
otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the
ordinance shall not stay the further review of an application for permits or
permissions to use such property; in these situations the appellant may request and
the Board of Adjustment may grant a stay of a final decision of permit applications
or building permits affected by the issue being appealed. Otherwise, the Board of
Adjustment shall hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time.
Unified Development Ordinance 321 Chapter B Article VI
(e) The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing as a witness.
The appellant may not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in the notice of
appeal. If any party or the town would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation
of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the Board of Adjustment shall
continue the hearing.
(f) Procedure to be Used in Processing Appeals and Interpretations of Decisions of
the Zoning Administrator or His/Her Designee Authorized by the Board of
Adjustment.
(i) Applications for appeals of decisions, determinations or interpretations
of the Zoning Administrator or his/her designee to be considered in any
month by the Board of Adjustment shall be made by the Board of
Adjustment shall be made by the property owner or the owner's
authorized agent or any other party with standing to the Town Clerk not
less than twenty (20) days prior to the established meeting date of that
month. Each petition shall be accompanied by:
 A fee as authorized in Section B.8.
 The written decision of the Zoning Administrator or his/her
designee that is the subject of the requested appeal or
interpretation.
(2) Board of Adjustment Authority. Upon appeal, the Board of Adjustment shall have the
following powers:
(a) To hear and decide appeals based on alleged error in any order, requirement or
decision made by the Zoning Administrator or his/her designee in the enforcement
of this Ordinance;
(b) To hear and decide requests for special exceptions or for the interpretation of the
Official Zoning Maps or for decisions upon other special questions upon which
the Board of Adjustment is authorized to pass.
(c) The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify
the decision appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision or
determination that ought to be made. The Board of Adjustment shall have all the
powers of the official who made the decision.
(d) When hearing an appeal pursuant to G.S. 160A-409(e) or any other appeal in the
nature of certiorari, the hearing shall be based on the record and the scope of
review shall be as provided in G.S. 160A- 393(k).
(3) Voting on Appeals/Interpretations. A majority of the members shall be required to
overturn a decision of the Zoning Administrator or his/her designee. For the purposes of
this subsection, vacant positions on the board and members who are disqualified from
voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not be considered members of the board for
calculation of the requisite majority if there are no qualified alternatives to take the place
of such members.
(E) Quasi-Judicial Decisions. The board shall determine contested facts and make its decision within
a reasonable time. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent, material, and
substantial evidence in the record. Each quasi-judicial decision shall be reduced to writing and
reflect the boards determination of contested facts and their application to the applicable standards.
Unified Development Ordinance 322 Chapter B Article VI
The written decision shall be signed by the chair or secretary of the board. A quasi-judicial decision
is effective upon filing the written decision with the clerk to the board. The decision of the board
shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first class mail to the applicant,
property owner, and to any person who has submitted a written request for a copy, prior to the date
the decision becomes effective. The person required to provide notice shall certify that proper notice
has been made.
(F) Subpoena Power. The board of adjustment through the chair, or in the chairs absence, any one
acting as chair, may subpoena witnesses and compel the production of evidence. To request
issuance of a subpoena, a person with standing under G.S. 160A-393(d) may make a written request
to the chair explaining why it is necessary for certain witnesses or evidence to be compelled. The
chair shall issue requested subpoenas he/she determines to be relevant, reasonable in nature and
scope, and not oppressive. Decisions regarding subpoenas made by the chair may be appealed to the
full Board of Adjustment. If a person fails or refuses to obey a subpoena issued pursuant to the
subsection, the Board of Adjustment or the party seeking the subpoena may apply to the General
Court of Justice for an order requiring that its subpoena be obeyed.
(G) Voting on All Other Matters. All other matters coming before the Board of Adjustment, such as
the approval of minutes or decision regarding rehearing requests, etc. shall be decided based on
majority vote. For the purposes of this subsection, vacant positions on the board and members who
are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not be considered members of the board
for calculation of the requisite majority if there are no qualified alternatives to take the place of such
members.

may be processed as a single application, including the application and fee requirements of this
Section 6-2.1(D), if all proposed zoning districts are contiguous and together constitute a unified
development proposal. For amendments to the zoning text, the sections of the Ordinance to be
amended and the new or revised language of the Ordinance proposed shall be submitted.
All rezoning applicants must submit a copy of the application and all supplemental information in
a digital format. Acceptable formats include WORD (.doc) for text information; PDF and JPEG for
site plans, elevations, and aerials; and CAD (.dwg) for legal descriptions which must use the North
American Datum (NAD_1983_HARN_StatePlane_North_Carolina_FIPS_3200_feet) so that the
file displays in the correct location within the Town of Kernersville. A text version of the legal
description is also required. Files should be placed on CDs and will not be returned to the applicant.
If there are changes in a rezoning application where the change alters the legal description or zoning
boundaries in any way, a new electronic file must be submitted immediately. Any delay in
Unified Development Ordinance 324 Chapter B Article VI
submitting the changes may result in a delay in processing the application.
(E) WAIVER OF FEES
The fee for a text amendment submitted by a private individual which, in the opinion of the
Community Development Director, is of public benefit, would introduce a beneficial change in the
Zoning Ordinance with application throughout the jurisdiction, and is not designed primarily to
benefit a single property or specific situation, may be waived by the Planning Board upon
recommendation of the Community Development Director. Said waiver must be approved prior to
formal consideration of the text amendment by the Planning Board.
(F) NOTICE TO NONPETITIONING OWNERS FOR A PLANNING BOARD PUBLIC
HEARING
Except for petitions providing notification under the provisions of Section 6-2(G), if a petition to
amend the zoning is not signed by all of the owners of all land for which rezoning is requested, the
following notification procedures shall be followed for a Planning Board Public Hearing:
(1) Notification. Except for a town initiated zoning map amendment, when an application is
filed to request a zoning map amendment and that application is not made by the owner of
the parcel(s) of land to which the amendment would apply, the applicant shall certify to the
Planning Board that the owner of the parcel(s) of land as shown on the county tax listing
has received actual notice of the proposed amendment and a copy of the notice of the public
hearing. The person or persons required to provide notice shall certify to the Planning
Board that proper notice has been provided in fact, and such certificate shall be deemed
conclusive in the absence of fraud.
(2) Undelivered Notices. If for any reason neither such letter notice is delivered, the petitioner
shall then file with the Planning Board a signed certificate setting forth that written
notification has been sent to all nonpetitioning owners who have not accepted notice by
signed statement, and shall attach thereto either the return receipts showing that the letters
have been delivered or the letters themselves and the mailing envelopes thereof.
(3) List of Owners Not Notified. In the event all letters are not delivered, the petitioner shall
attach to the certificate a list containing the names and street or mailing addresses and tax
PIN number(s) of the property within the boundaries covered by the petition of all
nonpetitioning owners to whose addresses written notice was not delivered. This list of
names and addresses shall be included in the notice of public hearing which shall be
published in a newspaper as provided for in this Article.
(4) Advertisement. Such publication of the public hearing, together with the names, addresses
and tax PIN number(s) of nonpetitioning owners shall be made within one hundred and
eighty (180) days of the posting of the first letter to the nonpetitioning owner at such
person's last known address. Otherwise, said notification procedure shall start anew. The
Planning Board shall not advertise the public hearing until receipt of the petitioner's
certificate as provided above.
(G) NOTIFICATION TO PROPERTY OWNERS AND ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNERS
FOR AN ELECTED BODY PUBLIC HEARING
Notification to property owners and adjacent property owners shall be handled as follows:
(1) Letters shall be sent via first class mail to all property owners within and adjacent to the
property for which the zoning map amendment is requested, in accordance with State law,
except as exempted under subsection (2) of this section. Except for a town initiated zoning
map amendment, when an application is filed to request a zoning map amendment and that
application is not made by the owner of the parcel(s) of land to which the amendment
would apply, the applicant shall certify to the Elected Body that the owner of the parcel(s)
of land as shown on the county tax listing has received actual notice of the proposed
Unified Development Ordinance 325 Chapter B Article VI
amendment and a copy of the notice of the public hearing. The person or persons required
to provide notice shall certify to the Elected Body that proper notice has been provided in
fact, and such certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud.
(2) The first class mail notice required under subsection (1) above shall not be required if the
zoning map amendment directly affects more than fifty (50) properties, owned by a total
of at least fifty (50) different property owners, and the governing unit uses the expanded
published notice provided for in this subsection. In this instance, a municipality or county
may choose to either make the mailed notice provided for in subsection (1) of this section
or may, as an alternative, elect to publish notice of the hearing as required in G.S. 160A-
364 or G.S. 153A-323, but provided that each advertisement shall not be less than one-half
of a newspaper page in size. The advertisement shall only be effective for property owners
who reside in the area of general circulation of the newspaper which publishes the notice.
Property owners who reside outside of the newspaper circulation area, according to the
address listed on the most recent property tax listing for the affected property shall be
notified according to the provisions of subsection (1) of the section. Actual notice of the
proposed amendment and a copy of the notice of public hearing required under subsection
(1) of this section shall be by any manner permitted under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4(j). If notice
cannot with due diligence be achieved by personal delivery, registered or certified mail, or
by a designated delivery service authorized pursuant to 60 U.S.C. 7502(f)(2), notice may
be given by publication consistent with G.S. 1A-1 Rule 4(j)(1). This subsection applies
only to an application to request a zoning map amendment where the application is not
made by the owner of the parcel(s) of land to which the amendment would apply. This
subsection does not apply to a town initiated zoning map amendment.
(3) In all cases of petitions to amend a zoning classification, the property shall be posted with
a notice of public hearing by the Elected Body at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of
said public hearing. Said notice shall consist of a sign(s) posted on the property at a
conspicuous location(s) or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way, which
sign shall be legible from the nearest public road. Location(s) which are not conspicuous
or require additional notification to the public will be required to have a directional sign(s)
posted. The signs are and shall remain the property of the governmental agency which
provided them, and shall be prepared, posted, and reclaimed by it. When multiple parcels
are included within a proposed amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is not
required, but there shall be sufficient signs posted to provide reasonable notice to interested
persons.
(H) FEES FOR NOTIFICATION
In addition to filing and sign posting fees, a fee to be determined by the Elected Body for each owner
indicated above will be charged to the petitioner to defray the costs of the research, preparation, and
mailing of a notice of the pending zoning classification action to each.
(I) ADVERTISING AND POSTING FOR A PLANNING BOARD PUBLIC HEARING
(1) Whenever a petition to amend this Ordinance is submitted to the Planning Board, the
Planning Board shall schedule a public hearing. Notice of the Planning Board public
hearing shall be advertised once in a newspaper of general circulation in the adopting
jurisdiction, said notice being not less than ten (10) days prior to the date fixed for the
hearing. Notice shall contain a location map identifying the location of said rezoning, a
north arrow, and show the intersection of at least two (2) public streets nearest to the
property.
(2) In all cases of petitions to amend a zoning classification, the property shall be posted with
a notice of public hearing by the Planning Board at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date
of said public hearing. Said notice shall consist of a sign(s) posted on the property at a
conspicuous location(s) or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way, which
Unified Development Ordinance 326 Chapter B Article VI
sign shall be legible from the nearest public road. Location(s) which are not conspicuous
or require additional notification to the public will be required to have a directional sign(s)
posted. Each sign(s) or each directional sign(s) will have an additional charge to be
determined by the Planning Board to the petitioner. The signs are and shall remain the
property of the governmental agency which provided them, and shall be prepared, posted,
and reclaimed by it. When multiple parcels are included within a proposed amendment, a
posting on each individual parcel is not required, but there shall be sufficient signs posted
to provide reasonable notice to interested persons.
(J) WITHDRAWAL
A zoning petition may not be withdrawn by the applicant after publication, or scheduled publication
which cannot be cancelled, of notice of public hearing except by permission of the appointed body
before which the petition is pending for action or consideration. Once the appointed body has acted
to forward a recommendation on the zoning petition to the appropriate elected body, the petition
may not be withdrawn by the applicant except with permission of the Elected Body. A public
hearing is not required to consider a request to withdraw. The filing fees are not refundable, except
that the Community Development Director may authorize refund of the fees if no notice expenses
related to the petition have been incurred.
(K) PROPERTY DESCRIPTION
A description of the property for which rezoning is requested shall be included with the petition.
Such description shall be by reference to the latest available parcel identifier as maintained in the
Forsyth County Tax Assessors GIS database, and shall include reference to a recorded plat, if
available. If a portion of a lot(s) is included in the petition, a written metes or bounds description
from a field survey or computed description no older than 5 years from the date of submittal shall
be submitted; said description shall be based on 1983 North American Datum (NAD) and shall
define a closed polygon. A copy of the most current deed of the property to be rezoned shall also
be submitted.
(L) ILLEGAL SPOT ZONE
If a petition appears to be a request for an illegal spot zone, the Community Development staff shall
consult the attorney for the adopting jurisdiction. If the Attorney submits an opinion that the petition
is a request for a spot zone, the petitioner shall be so informed and offered the option to withdraw
the petition and recover the filing fee, less any advertising cost.
(M) PLANNING BOARD REVIEW
The Planning Board shall submit a report and recommendations to the Elected Body in writing
within one hundred and twenty (120) days after receipt by the Planning Board of a complete petition,
including compliance with Section 6-2.1(F) above, unless such period is extended by the Elected
Body. Failure to submit a report and recommendation shall not be deemed to constitute either
approval or disapproval of the petition by the Planning Board.
In the report, the Planning Board shall advise and comment on whether the proposed amendment is
consistent with the Kernersville Development Plan and any other officially adopted plan that is
applicable. The Planning Board shall provide a written recommendation to the Elected Body that
addresses plan consistency and whether the proposed amendment is reasonable and in the public
interest. A statement by the Planning Board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the
Kernersville Development Plan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the amendment by
the Elected Body.
The Planning Board shall, at the same time, mail or deliver to the petitioner and also to the
opponent(s), if any, a copy of the same report and recommendations sent to the Elected Body. In
case there is more than one petitioner for or opponent to the proposed change, it shall be sufficient
to mail or deliver a copy of the report and notice of any subsequent hearing before the Elected Body
to the one petitioner designated by the petitioners to receive same and to any such opponent who
requests receipt of such report in writing at the public hearing. Furthermore, in any case where any
Unified Development Ordinance 327 Chapter B Article VI
of the parties are represented by an attorney named in the petition, the mailing or delivery of a copy
of the report and notice of any hearing to the attorney shall be the equivalent of mailing or delivering
the same to the party or parties represented by the attorney.
(N) ELECTED BODY PUBLIC HEARING
A public hearing shall be held by the Elected Body on each proposed amendment to the Zoning
Ordinance, after publication of notice, as hereinabove provided. Said proposed amendment shall
be placed on the agenda of a regularly scheduled public hearing of the Elected Body within sixty
(60) days of receipt of the report and recommendations of the Planning Board.
A member of the Elected Body shall not vote on any zoning map or text amendment where the
outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily
identifiable financial impact on the member.
(O) PROTEST PETITION
If any resident or property owner in the Town submits a written statement regarding a proposed
amendment, modification, or repeal to a zoning ordinance to the clerk to the board at least two
business days prior to the proposed vote on such change, the clerk to the board shall deliver such
written statement to the Board of Aldermen. If the proposed change is the subject of a quasi-judicial
proceeding under G.S. 160A-388, the clerk shall provide only the names and addresses of the
individuals providing written comment, and the provision of such names and addresses to all
members of the board shall not disqualify any member of the board from voting.
(P) LIMITS ON RESUBMITTAL
(1) Previous Denial. In the event that a petition to amend the text or the zoning maps is denied
by the Elected Body, a period of two (2) years must elapse before another petition for the
same kind of change in the regulations or for the same zoning classification of land
previously involved may be submitted. Further, a period of one year must elapse before a
new petition for any change in zoning classification of land previously involved may be
submitted. Such one year or two (2) year period shall be measured from the date of
acceptance of the previous petition by the Planning Board for the change in regulations or
in the classification of the land. The limitations on the filing of new petitions in this
subparagraph shall not preclude the filing by a property owner or the acceptance of a new
petition from a property owner within the one year or two (2) year waiting periods
following the filing of a petition by a petitioner other than the owner of the property
affected, if the owner of such property opposed rezoning at a public hearing before the
Planning Board or expressed opposition to the proposed rezoning in writing to the Planning
Board prior to such public hearing.
(2) Elected Body Authority. Nothing in this section shall constitute a limitation upon the
authority of the Elected Body or the Planning Board to consider or reconsider, upon their
own motion, any changes to the regulations or district boundaries of the Zoning Ordinance,
or any zoning or rezoning of property. Further, nothing in this chapter shall affect the
validity or effectiveness of any recommendation made by the Planning Board prior to the
effective date of this amendment, and the Elected Body may lawfully act on such
recommendation as if it had been made by the Planning Board subsequent to the effective
date of this amendment. Any such consideration, reconsideration or act by the Elected
Body shall comply with the notice requirements for ordinance amendments contained in
this Ordinance.
(Q) CONSIDERATION
In deliberating each petition for amendment of the Official Zoning Maps, the Elected Body may
consider such information and assertions as are presented in the petition as well as evidence
presented and arguments made at the public hearing. Additional considerations by the Elected Body
may include, but shall not be limited to the following:

uses permitted on other property in the vicinity;
(3) Whether changing conditions have substantially affected the area included in the petition;
and

be punishable until the expiration of ten (10) days after notice shall have been issued by the Zoning
Administrator and served upon such violator. Each and every day beyond the initial ten (10) day notice
period during which such violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense.
9-1.2 CIVIL PENALTIES

this Ordinance shall be subject to a civil penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day to be
recovered by the Town of Kernersville in a civil action in the nature of a debt. No civil penalty
shall be assessed until the person, firm, or corporation alleged to be in violation of the Ordinance
has been issued a written Notice Of Violation by the zoning officer. Such Notice Of Violation may
be served upon the person, firm, or corporation either personally or by certified mail. Failure to
correct the violation within ten (10) days of the date of service upon the person, firm, or
corporation in violation, or by the end of any period of any extension granted in writing by the
zoning officer for good cause shown, shall subject the violating party to the aforementioned civil

collective action and/or abatement is completed. Each day of any continuing violation shall
constitute a separate violation. Civil penalties shall accrue until the violation is corrected or
abated. Regardless of any subsequent cure of violation by collective action(s) and/or abatement,
the violating party shall be liable for all civil penalties accrued to the date of collective action
and/or abatement.
(B) COLLECTION OF CIVIL PENALTIES
Payment of civil penalties prescribed herein shall be payable to the Town of Kernersville by or on
behalf of the violating party. Failure to pay assessed civil penalties, as set forth herein shall subject

9-1.3 INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER RELIEF
(A) REFERRAL TO ATTORNEY
In addition to other remedies provided by law, whenever the Zoning Administrator has reasonable
cause to believe that any person is violating or threatening to violate this Ordinance, the Zoning
Administrator may refer the matter to the jurisdiction's Attorney.
Unified Development Ordinance 341 Chapter B Article IX

Any violation of a condition or other provision shown on the face of a site plan adopted as part of a special
use district permit issued by the Elected Body shall be a violation of this Ordinance. Where the Zoning
Administrator determines that any term or condition of a special use district permit is not adhered to, he
shall notify the petitioner or successor in interest of his findings in writing. The petitioner shall have ten
(10) days unless the Zoning Administrator determines that a longer period of time is reasonably necessary

the specified period, all development shall cease and all government permits granted pursuant thereto, such
as but not necessarily limited to, a building permit, shall be revoked. The Community Development
Director shall determine the proper procedure to amend the site plan, including a formal site plan
amendment or a staff change pursuant to Section 6-2.

Subdivision Regulations or transfers or sells land by reference to, exhibition of, or any other use of a plat
showing a subdivision of the land before the plat has been properly approved under such Regulations and
recorded in the Register of Deeds, shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The description by metes and
bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring land
shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty. The respective unit of government may bring an action
for injunction of any illegal subdivision, transfer, conveyance, or sale of land and the court shall, upon
appropriate findings, issue an injunction and order requiring the offending party to comply with the
Subdivision Regulations. Building permits may be denied for lots that have been illegally subdivided. In

CHAPTER C - ENVIRONMENTAL ORDINANCE
ARTICLE II - FLOODWAY AND FLOODWAY FRINGE REGULATIONS
2-1 GENERAL
2-1.1 FINDINGS OF FACT
(A) The flood prone areas within the jurisdictions of Kernersville are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
(B) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing
increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses
vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
2-1.2 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize
public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
(A) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion
hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
(B) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(C) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(D) Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood
damage; and
(E) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or
which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
2-1.3 OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this chapter are:
(A) Protect human life, safety, and health;
(B) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(C) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken
at the expense of the general public;
(D) Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
(E) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains, electric, telephone,
cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;
Unified Development Ordinance 349 Chapter C Article II
(F) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone
areas; and
(G) Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area.
2-1.4 DEFINITIONS
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give
them the meaning they have in Chapter A, Article II (Definitions) or in common usage, and to give this
ordinance its most reasonable application. In the event of conflict with Chapter A, Article II (Definitions),
the definitions below shall control.
Accessory Structure (Appurtenant Structure) means a structure located on the same parcel of property
as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Garages,
carports and storage sheds are common urban accessory structures. Pole barns, hay sheds and the like
qualify as accessory structures on farms, and may or may not be located on the same parcel as the farm
dwelling or shop building.
Addition (to an existing building) means an extension or increase in the floor area or height of a building
or structure.
Appeal means a request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's interpretation of any provision of
this ordinance.
Area of Shallow Flooding means a designated Zone AO on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) with base flood depths determined to be from one (1) to three (3) feet. These areas are located
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident.
Area of Special Flood Hazard see Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)
Base Flood means the flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given
year.
Base Flood Elevation (BFE) means a determination of the water surface elevations of the base flood as
published in the Flood Insurance Study. When the BFE has not been provided in a Special Flood Hazard
Area, it may be obtained from engineering studies available from a Federal, State, or other source using
FEMA approved engineering methodologies. This elevation, when combined with the Freeboard,
establishes the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.
Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
Building see Structure.

resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either by certified engineered foundation
Unified Development Ordinance 366 Chapter C Article II
system, or in accordance with the most current edition of the State of North Carolina
Regulations for Manufactured Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance
pursuant to NCGS 143-143.15. Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an
elevation of the chassis thirty-six (36) inches or less above the grade at the site, the
chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the
elevation of the chassis is above thirty-six (36) inches in height, an engineering
certification is required.

each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
(c) If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed area must have
flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit;
(d) The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot
above the adjacent grade;
(e) Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or
devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both
directions; and
(f) Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for regulatory
purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood openings. Masonry or wood
underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure and
requires flood openings as outlined above.
Unified Development Ordinance 367 Chapter C Article II
(F) Additions/Improvements
(1) Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the addition and/or

addition to the provisions of Section C.2-3.1, shall apply:
(A) No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or new
development shall be permitted within a distance of twenty (20) feet each side from top of bank or
five times the width of the stream, whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
(B) The BFE used in determining the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation shall be determined
based on the following criteria:
(1) When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is available from other sources, all new
construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall also comply with all
applicable provisions of this ordinance and shall be elevated or floodproofed in
accordance with standards in Sections C.2-3.1 and C.2-3.2.

shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1)
to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to Sections C.2-3.1 and C.2-3.2, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall meet the following requirements:
(A) The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth number specified on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a freeboard of four (4) feet, above the highest adjacent
grade; or at least four (4) feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
(B) Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be floodproofed to the same level as required
in Section C.2-3.7(A) so that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities,
below that level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water
and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required in accordance with Section C.2-2.4 and

CHAPTER C - ENVIRONMENTAL ORDINANCE
ARTICLE IV - STORM WATER RUNOFF
4-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
4-1.1 TITLE
This ordinance shall be officially known as Stormwater Ordinance. It is referred to herein as this
ordinance.
4-1.2 AUTHORITY
The Town of Kernersville Board of Aldermen is authorized to adopt this ordinance pursuant to North
Carolina law, including but not limited to Article 14, Section 5 of the Constitution of North Carolina; Section
1 of the Revised Charter of the Town of Kernersville; North Carolina General Statutes 143-214.7 and rules
promulgated by the Environmental Management Commission thereunder; Session Law 2004-163; Chapter
160A, §§ 174, 185; as well as Chapter 113A, Article 4 (Sedimentation Pollution Control); Article 21, Part 6
(Floodway Regulation); Chapter 160A, Article 19 (Planning and Regulation of Development), ; Chapter
153A, Article 18.
4-1.3 FINDINGS
It is hereby determined that:
Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increases stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution,
and sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge;
These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants and
alterations in hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment;
and
These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned controls to manage
stormwater runoff from development sites.
Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (Clean Water Act) and federal Phase II
Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the North Carolina Environmental Management
Commission promulgated in response to federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas,
including this jurisdiction, to adopt the minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this
ordinance.
Therefore, the Town of Kernersville Board of Aldermen establishes this set of water quality and quantity
regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and
discharge.
4-1.4 PURPOSE
4-1.4a General
The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and
general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of
increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new
development and redevelopment and by preventing the introduction of potentially harmful materials and illicit
discharges into the Town of Kernersville Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4); and to meet the
requirements in the Town of Kernersvilles National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit for
Storm Water Discharges NCS000483 effective date October 1, 2005. It has been determined that proper
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C Article IV

conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of green space and other conservation areas to the
maximum extent practicable;
6. Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural and
nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained
appropriately, and pose no threat to public safety;
7. Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of
stormwater management plans, for the inspection of approved projects, and to assure appropriate
long-term maintenance.
8. Controlling illicit discharges into the Town of Kernersville municipal separate storm sewer system.

C. The approval of the stormwater permit shall require an enforceable restriction on property usage
that runs with the land, such as a recorded deed restriction or protective covenants, to ensure
that future development and redevelopment maintains the site consistent with the approved
project plans.
4-3.7 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR HIGH-DENSITY PROJECTS
High-density projects shall implement stormwater control measures that comply with each of the following
standards:
A. The measures shall utilize engineered stormwater controls to control runoff from the first
inch of rainfall. Runoff volume drawdown time shall be a minimum of 24 hours, but not
more than 120 hours.
B. All structural stormwater treatment systems used to meet the requirements of the program
shall be designed to have a minimum of 85% average annual removal for Total Suspended
Solids;

4-3.12 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT
A. In nGereal
Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or building site to be served by a structural BMP
pursuant to this ordinance, and prior to issuance of any permit for development or redevelopment
requiring a structural BMP pursuant to this ordinance, the applicant or owner of the site must
execute an operation and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of
the site, portions of the site, and lots or parcels served by the structural BMP. Until the transference
of all property, sites, or lots served by the structural BMP, the original owner or applicant shall have
primary responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the maintenance agreement.
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C Article IV
434
The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner or owners to maintain, repair and,
if necessary, reconstruct the structural BMP, and shall state the terms, conditions, and schedule of
maintenance for the structural BMP. In addition, it shall grant to the Town of Kernersville a right
of entry in the event that the Stormwater Administrator has reason to believe it has become necessary
to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the structural BMP; however, in no case shall
the right of entry, of itself, confer an obligation on the Town of Kernersville to assume responsibility
for the structural BMP.
The operation and maintenance agreement must be approved by the Stormwater Administrator prior
to plan approval, and it shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with the county
Register of Deeds upon final plat approval. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall be
given to the Stormwater Administrator within fourteen (14) days following its recordation.

required operation and maintenance agreement shall include all of the following provisions:
(1) Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously operate and maintain the
stormwater control and management facilities.
(2) Establishment of an escrow account, which can be spent solely for sediment
removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, or reconstruction
of the structural BMPs. If structural BMPs are not performing adequately or as intended
or are not properly maintained, the Town of Kernersville in its sole discretion, may remedy
the situation, and in such instances the Town of Kernersville shall be fully reimbursed from
the escrow account. Escrowed funds may be spent by the association for sediment removal,
structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, and reconstruction of the
structural BMPs, provided that the Town of Kernersville shall first consent to the
expenditure. Escrowed funds shall not be spent for routine landscaping maintenance items
such as mowing.

fifteen (15) per cent of the initial construction cost of the structural BMPs. Twothirds
(2/3) of the total amount of sinking fund budget shall be deposited into the escrow
account within the first five (5) years and the full amount shall be deposited within ten (10)
years following initial construction of the structural BMPs. Funds shall be deposited each
year into the escrow account. A portion of the annual assessments of the association shall
include an allocation into the escrow account. Any funds drawn down from the escrow
account shall be replaced in accordance with the schedule of anticipated work
used to create the sinking fund budget.
(4) Requirement that the association is formed and the association bylaws are
submitted to the Town prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot, unit or building site.

a breach of the agreement. The Town of Kernersville shall thereafter be entitled to bring
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C Article IV
435
an action against the association and its members to pay, or foreclose upon the lien hereby
authorized by the agreement against the property, or both, in case of a deficiency. Interest,
collection costs, and attorney fees shall be added to the recovery.
(7) A statement that this agreement shall not obligate the Town of Kernersville to
maintain or repair any structural BMPs, and the Town of Kernersville shall not be liable
to any person for the condition or operation of structural BMPs.
(8) A statement that this agreement shall not in any way diminish, limit, or restrict
the right of the Town of Kernersville to enforce any of its ordinances as authorized by law.

The Town of Kernersville Board of Aldermen is authorized to adopt this ordinance pursuant to North
Carolina law, including but not limited to Article 14, Section 5 of the Constitution of North Carolina; Section
1 of the Revised Charter of the Town of Kernersville; North Carolina General Statutes 143-214.7 and rules
promulgated by the Environmental Management Commission thereunder; Session Law 2004-163; Chapter
160A, §§ 174, 185; as well as Chapter 113A, Article 4 (Sedimentation Pollution Control); Article 21, Part 6
(Floodway Regulation); Chapter 160A, Article 19 (Planning and Regulation of Development), ; Chapter
153A, Article 18.
4-1.3 FINDINGS
It is hereby determined that:
Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increases stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution,
and sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge;
These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants and
alterations in hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment;
and
These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned controls to manage
stormwater runoff from development sites.
Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (Clean Water Act) and federal Phase II
Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the North Carolina Environmental Management
Commission promulgated in response to federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas,
including this jurisdiction, to adopt the minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this
ordinance.
Therefore, the Town of Kernersville Board of Aldermen establishes this set of water quality and quantity
regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and
discharge.
4-1.4 PURPOSE
4-1.4a General
The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety,
environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control
the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source
pollution associated with new development and redevelopment and by preventing the introduction
of potentially harmful materials and illicit discharges into the Town of Kernersville Municipal
Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4); and to meet the requirements in the Town of Kernersvilles
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit for Storm Water Discharges NCS000483
effective date October 1, 2005. It has been determined that proper management of constructionrelated
and post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C Article IV
410
property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare, and protect
water and aquatic resources.
4-1.4b Specific
This ordinance seeks to meet its general purpose through the following specific objectives and
means:
1. Establishing decision-making processes for development that protect the integrity of
watersheds and preserve the health of water resources;
2. Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development
hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable for the
applicable design storm in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, nonpoint and
point source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and to maintain the integrity of
stream channels and aquatic habitats;
3. Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design
criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
4. Establishing design and review criteria for the construction, function, and use of structural
stormwater BMPs that may be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater
management standards;
5. Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices, such as the use of
vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of green space and other
conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable;
6. Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural
and nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure that they continue to function as designed,
are maintained appropriately, and pose no threat to public safety;
7. Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and
disapproval of stormwater management plans, for the inspection of approved projects, and
to assure appropriate long-term maintenance.
8. Controlling illicit discharges into the Town of Kernersville municipal separate storm
sewer system.
9. Controlling erosion and sedimentation from construction activities.
10. Assigning responsibility and processes for approving the creation and maintenance of
adequate drainage and flood damage prevention.
11. To reduce the discharge of pollutants to the storm sewer system to the maximum extent
practicable by requiring, where appropriate, the use of best management practices,
structural and/or nonstructural storm water quantity and quality control measures and other
provisions.
12. To prohibit non-storm water discharges to the Town of Kernersville municipal separate
storm sewer system and require the removal of illicit connections to the municipal separate
storm sewer system.
13. To prevent improper disposal of materials that degrade water quality.
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C Article IV
411
14. To permit sampling and monitoring for pollutants such as those associated with illicit
discharges, improper disposal, industrial and construction activities, and the application of
pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers.
15. To reduce erosion associated with storm water runoff.

A. In General
Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or building site to be served by a structural BMP
pursuant to this ordinance, and prior to issuance of any permit for development or redevelopment
requiring a structural BMP pursuant to this ordinance, the applicant or owner of the site must
execute an operation and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of
the site, portions of the site, and lots or parcels served by the structural BMP. Until the transference
of all property, sites, or lots served by the structural BMP, the original owner or applicant shall have
primary responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the maintenance agreement.
The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner or owners to maintain, repair and,
if necessary, reconstruct the structural BMP, and shall state the terms, conditions, and schedule of
maintenance for the structural BMP. In addition, it shall grant to the Town of Kernersville a right
of entry in the event that the Stormwater Administrator has reason to believe it has become necessary
to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the structural BMP; however, in no case shall
the right of entry, of itself, confer an obligation on the Town of Kernersville to assume responsibility
for the structural BMP.
The operation and maintenance agreement must be approved by the Stormwater Administrator prior

5-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
5-1.1 AUTHORITY
This Ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authority vested in Town of Kernersville by the Session Laws and
the General Statutes of North Carolina, particularly Session Law 2009-216 (House Bill 239), Session Law
2009-484 (Senate Bill 838), N.C Gen. Stat §153A-121, 153A-140, Chapter 153A, Article 18, N.C. Gen. Stat
§160A-174, 160A-193, Chapter 160A, Article 19, and any special legislation enacted by the General
Assembly for Town of Kernersville.
5-1.2 PURPOSE AND INTENT
The purposes of the Town of Kernersville in adopting the following Ordinance is to protect and preserve
existing riparian buffers throughout the Jordan Watershed as generally described in Rule 15A NCAC 02B
.0262 (Jordan Water Supply Nutrient Strategy: Purpose and Scope), in order to maintain their nutrient
removal and stream protection functions. Additionally this Ordinance will help protect the water supply uses
of Jordan Reservoir and of designated water supplies throughout the Jordan watershed.
Buffers adjacent to streams provide multiple environmental protection and resource management benefits.
Forested buffers enhance and protect the natural ecology of stream systems, as well as water quality through
bank stabilization, shading, and nutrient removal. They also help to minimize flood damage in flood prone
areas. Well-vegetated streamside riparian areas help to remove nitrogen and prevent sediment and sedimentbound
pollutants such as phosphorous from reaching the streams.
5-1.3 TITLE
This Ordinance shall be known as the Town of Kernersville Riparian Buffer Protection Ordinance for Lands
within the Jordan Watershed.
5-1.4 JURISDICTION
This Ordinance shall be applied to all land in the planning jurisdiction of Town of Kernersville that is located
within the Jordan Reservoir Watershed.
5-1.5 APPLICABILITY
This Ordinance applies to all landowners and other persons conducting activities in the area described in
Section 4, with the exception of activities conducted under the authority of the State, the United States,
multiple jurisdictions, or local units of government, and forest harvesting and agricultural activities. The NC
Division of Water Quality shall administer the requirements of Rule 15A NCAC 02B .0267 and .0268 (Jordan
Water Supply Nutrient Strategy: Protection of Existing Riparian Buffers and Mitigation of Existing Riparian
Buffers, respectively) for these activities.
5-1.6 RELATION TO OTHER ORDINANCES
The requirements of this Ordinance shall supersede all locally implemented buffer requirements stated in
Rules 15A NCAC 02B .0214 through .0216 as applied to WS-II, WS-III, and WS-IV waters in the Jordan
watershed. If the provisions of this ordinance otherwise conflict with the provisions of any other validly
enforceable ordinance(s) or laws, the most stringent provisions shall control. This Ordinance is not intended
to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law.
5-1.7 RIPARIAN AREA PROTECTION WITHIN THE JORDAN RESERVOIR WATERSHED
A. Buffers Protected
The following minimum criteria shall be used for identifying regulated buffers:
1. This Ordinance shall apply to activities conducted within, or outside of with hydrologic
impacts in violation of the diffuse flow requirements set out in Section 7.(E) upon, 50-foot
wide riparian buffers directly adjacent to surface waters in the Jordan watershed
(intermittent streams, perennial streams, lakes, reservoirs and ponds), excluding wetlands.
442
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C Article V
03/03/2015
2. Wetlands adjacent to surface waters or within 50 feet of surface waters shall be considered
as part of the riparian buffer but are regulated pursuant to Rules 15A NCAC 2B .0230 and
.0231, Rules 15A NCAC 2H .0500, 15A NCAC 2H .1300, and Sections 401 and 404 of

for comment. Alternative maps approved by the Commission shall not be used
for buffer delineation on projects that are existing and ongoing within the meaning
of Section 7. (C) of this Ordinance.
4. Where the specific origination point of a stream regulated under this Item is in question,
upon request of the NC Division of Water Quality or another party, the Town of
Kernersville shall make an on-site determination. A Town of Kernersville representative
who has successfully completed the Divisions Surface Water Identification Training
Certification course, its successor, or other equivalent training curriculum approved by the
Division, shall establish that point using the latest version of the Division publication,
Identification Methods for the Origins of Intermittent and Perennial Streams, available at
http://h2o.enr.state.nc.us/ncwetlands/documents/
NC_Stream_ID_Manual.pdf or from the NC Division of Water Quality - 401 Oversight
Express Permitting Unit, or its successor. The Town of Kernersville may accept the results
of a site assessment made by another party who meets these criteria. Any disputes over onsite
determinations made according to this Item shall be referred to the Director of the

Pollution Control Act.
7. No new clearing, grading, or development shall take place nor shall any new building
permits be issued in violation of this Ordinance.
B. Exemption Based on Onsite Determination
When a landowner or other affected party including the Division believes that the maps have
inaccurately depicted surface waters, he or she shall consult the Town of Kernersville. Upon
request, a Town of Kernersville representative who has successfully completed the Division of
Water Qualitys Surface Water Identification Training Certification course, its successor, or other
equivalent training curriculum approved by the Division, shall make an on-site determination. The
Town of Kernersville may also accept the results of site assessments made by other parties who
have successfully completed such training. Any disputes over on-site determinations shall be
referred to the Director of the Division of Water Quality c/o the 401 Oversight Express Permitting
Unit, or its successor, in writing. A determination of the Director as to the accuracy or application
of the maps is subject to review as provided in Articles 3 and 4 of G.S. 150B. Surface waters that
appear on the maps shall not be subject to these buffer requirements if a site evaluation reveals any
of the following cases:
443
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C Article V
03/03/2015
1. Man-made ponds and lakes that are not part of a natural drainage way that is classified in
accordance with 15A NCAC 2B .0100, including ponds and lakes created for animal
watering, irrigation, or other agricultural uses. (A pond or lake is part of a natural drainage
way when it is fed by an intermittent or perennial stream or when it has a direct discharge
point to an intermittent or perennial stream.)
2. Ephemeral streams.
3. The absence on the ground of a corresponding intermittent or perennial stream, lake,
reservoir, or pond.
4. Ditches or other man-made water conveyances, other than modified natural streams.
C. Exemption when Existing Uses are Present and Ongoing
This Ordinance shall not apply to uses that are existing and ongoing; however, this Ordinance shall
apply at the time an existing, ongoing use is changed to another use. Change of use shall involve
the initiation of any activity that does not meet either of the following criteria for existing, ongoing
activity:
1. It was present within the riparian buffer as of the effective date of this Ordinance and has
continued to exist since that time. Existing uses shall include agriculture, buildings,
industrial facilities, commercial areas, transportation facilities, maintained lawns, utility
lines and on-site sanitary sewage systems, any of which involve either specific, periodic
management of vegetation or displacement of vegetation by structures or regular activity.
Only the portion of the riparian buffer occupied by the footprint of the existing use is
exempt from this Ordinance. Change of ownership through purchase or inheritance is not
a change of use. Activities necessary to maintain uses are allowed provided that the site
remains similarly vegetated, no impervious surface is added within 50 feet of the surface
water where it did not previously exist as of the effective date of this Ordinance, and
existing diffuse flow is maintained. Grading and revegetating Zone Two is allowed
provided that the health of the vegetation in Zone One is not compromised, the ground is
stabilized and existing diffuse flow is maintained.
2. Projects or proposed development that are determined by the Town of Kernersville to meet
at least one of the following criteria:
a. Project requires a 401 Certification/404 Permit and these were issued prior to the
effective date this Ordinance, and prior to the effective date of this Ordinance.
b. Projects that require a state permit, such as landfills, NPDES wastewater
discharges, land application of residuals and road construction activities, have
begun construction or are under contract to begin construction and had received
all required state permits and certifications prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance;
c. Projects that are being reviewed through the Clean Water Act Section
404/National Environmental Policy Act Merger 01 Process (published by the US
Army Corps of Engineers and Federal Highway Administration, 2003) or its
immediate successor and that have reached agreement with DENR on avoidance
and minimization by the effective date of this Ordinance; or
d. Projects that are not required to be reviewed by the Clean Water Act Section
404/National Environmental Policy Act Merger 01 Process (published by the US
Army Corps of Engineers and Federal Highway Administration, 2003) or its
immediate successor if a Finding of No Significant Impact has been issued for the
project and the project has the written approval of the Town of Kernersville prior
to the effective date of this Ordinance.
D. Zones of the Riparian Buffer
The protected riparian buffer shall have two zones as follows:
444
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C Article V
03/03/2015

in the Table of Uses, Section 8. (B) of this Ordinance. The location of Zone One shall be
as follows:
a. For intermittent and perennial streams, Zone One shall begin at the top of the bank
and extend landward a distance of 30 feet on all sides of the surface water,
measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to a vertical line marking the top of
the bank.
b. For ponds, lakes and reservoirs located within a natural drainage way, Zone One
shall begin at the normal water level and extend landward a distance of 30 feet,
measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to a vertical line marking the
normal water level.
2. Zone Two shall consist of a stable, vegetated area that is undisturbed except for uses
provided for in the Table of Uses, Section 8. (B) of this Ordinance. Grading and
revegetating in Zone Two is allowed provided that the health of the vegetation in Zone One
is not compromised. Zone Two shall begin at the outer edge of Zone One and extend
landward 20 feet as measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface water.
The combined width of Zones One and Two shall be 50 feet on all sides of the surface
water.
E. Diffuse Flow Requirements
Diffuse flow of runoff shall be maintained in the riparian buffer by dispersing concentrated flow
prior to its entry into the buffer and reestablishing vegetation as follows:
1. Concentrated runoff from new ditches or man-made conveyances shall be converted to
diffuse flow at non-erosive velocities before the runoff enters Zone Two of the riparian
buffer;
2. Periodic corrective action to restore diffuse flow shall be taken as necessary and shall be
designed to impede the formation of erosion gullies; and
3. As set out in Sections 7.(D) and 8.(B) of this Ordinance, The Zones of the Riparian Buffer
and Table of Uses respectively, no new stormwater conveyances are allowed through the
buffers except for those specified in the Table of Uses, Section 8.(B) of this Ordinance,

or its successor. The Directors decision is subject to review as provided in G.S. 150B
Articles 3 and 4.
B. Variances
1. Requirements for Variances.
Persons who wish to undertake prohibited uses may pursue a variance. The Town of
Kernersville may grant minor variances. For major variances, the Town of Kernersville
shall prepare preliminary findings and submit them to the Division of Water Quality, 4 01
Oversight Express Permitting Unit, or its successor for approval by the Environmental
Management Commission. The variance request procedure shall be as follows:
a. For any variance request, the Town of Kernersville shall make a finding of fact as
to whether there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that prevent
compliance with the riparian buffer protection requirements. A finding of
practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships shall require that the following
conditions are met:
i. If the applicant complies with the provisions of this Ordinance, he/she
can secure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, his/her
property. Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit
from the property shall not be considered adequate justification for a
variance. Moreover, the Town of Kernersville shall consider whether
the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this
Ordinance that shall make reasonable use of the property possible;
ii. The hardship results from application of this Ordinance to the property
rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship;
iii. The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicants property,
such as its size, shape, or topography, such that compliance with
455
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C Article V
03/03/2015
provisions of this ordinance would not allow reasonable use of the
property;
iv. The applicant did not cause the hardship by knowingly or unknowingly
violating this Ordinance;
v. The applicant did not purchase the property after the effective date of
this Ordinance, and then request a variance; and
vi. The hardship is rare or unique to the applicants property.
vii. The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the
States riparian buffer protection requirements and this Ordinance and
preserves its spirit; and
viii. In granting the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured,
water quality has been protected, and substantial justice has been done.
2. Minor Variances
A minor variance request pertains to activities that will impact only Zone Two of the
riparian buffer. Minor variance requests shall be reviewed and approved based on the
criteria in Section 9.(B)(1) by the Town of Kernersville pursuant to G.S. 153A-Article 18,
or G.S. 160A-Article 19. The Town of Kernersville may attach conditions to the variance
approval that support the purpose, spirit, and intent of the riparian buffer protection
program. Request for appeals to decisions made by the Town of Kernersville shall be made
in writing to the Director of the Division of Water Quality c/o the 401 Oversight Express
Permitting Unit, or its successor. The Directors decision is subject to review as provided
in G.S. 150B Articles 3 and 4.
3. Major Variances
A major variance request pertains to activities that will impact any portion of Zone One or
any portion of both Zones One and Two of the riparian buffer. If Town of Kernersville has
determined that a major variance request meets the requirements in Section 9.(B)(1))
through 8.(C)(3), then it shall prepare a preliminary finding and submit it to the NC
Environmental Management Commission c/o the Division of Water Quality, 401
Oversight Express Permitting Unit, or its successor, for approval. Within 90 days after
receipt by Town of Kernersville, the Commission shall review preliminary findings on
major variance requests and take one of the following actions: approve, approve with
conditions and stipulations, or deny the request. Appeals from a Commission decision on
a major variance request are made on judicial review to Superior Court.

a. A person has received an Authorization Certificate pursuant to Section 9.(A) of
this Ordinance for a proposed use that is designated as allowable with
mitigation; or
b. A person has received a variance pursuant to Section 9. (B) of this Ordinance and
is required to perform mitigation as a condition of a variance approval.
2. Issuance of the Mitigation Approval
Town of Kernersville shall issue a mitigation approval upon determining that a proposal
meets the requirements set out in this Ordinance. The approval shall identify at a minimum
the option chosen, the required and proposed areas, and either the mitigation location or
the offset payment amount as applicable.

456
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C Article V
03/03/2015
of the US Army Corps of Engineers, currently set out
at http://www.saw.usace.army.mil/WETLANDS/Mitigation/mitbanks.html or
from the US Army Corps of Engineers, P.O. Box 1890, Wilmington, NC, 28402-
1890, and the applicable trading criteria in Rule 15A NCAC 02B .0273;
b. Donation of real property or of an interest in real property pursuant to Section
9.(C)(6) of this Ordinance; or
c. Restoration or enhancement of a non-forested riparian buffer pursuant to the
requirements of Section 9. (C)(7) of this Ordinance.
4. The Area of Mitigation
Town of Kernersville shall determine the required area of mitigation, which shall apply to
all mitigation options identified in Section 9.(C)(3) of this Ordinance and as further
specified in the requirements for each option set out in this Section, according to the
following:
a. The impacts in square feet to each zone of the riparian buffer shall be determined
by Town of Kernersville by adding the following:
i. The area of the footprint of the use causing the impact to the riparian
buffer;
ii. The area of the boundary of any clearing and grading activities within
the riparian buffer necessary to accommodate the use; and
iii. The area of any ongoing maintenance corridors within the riparian buffer
associated with the use.
b. The required area of mitigation shall be determined by applying the following
multipliers to the impacts determined in Section 9. (4)(a) of this Ordinance to each
zone of the riparian buffer:
i. Impacts to Zone One of the riparian buffer shall be multiplied by three;
ii. Impacts to Zone Two of the riparian buffer shall be multiplied by one
and one-half; and

For any option chosen, the mitigation effort shall be located within the same subwatershed
of the Jordan watershed, as defined in 15A NCAC 02B.0262, and the same distance from
the Jordan Reservoir as the proposed impact, or closer to the Reservoir than the impact,
and as close to the location of the impact as feasible. Alternatively, the applicant may
propose mitigation anywhere within the same subwatershed of the Jordan watershed, as
defined in 15A NCAC 02B.0262, provided that the mitigation proposal accounts for
differences in delivery of nutrients to the affected arm of Jordan Reservoir resulting from
differences between the locations of the buffer impact and mitigation. Additional location
requirements for the property donation option are enumerated in Section 9. (C)(6)(c)(i) of
this Ordinance.
6. Donation of Property
Persons who choose to satisfy their mitigation determination by donating real property or
an interest in real property shall meet the following requirements:
a. The donation of real property interests may be used to either partially or fully
satisfy the payment of a compensatory mitigation fee to the Riparian Buffer
Restoration Fund pursuant to 15A NCAC 02B .0273. The value of the property
interest shall be determined by an appraisal performed in accordance with Section
9. (C)(6)(d)(iv) of this Ordinance. The donation shall satisfy the mitigation
determination if the appraised value of the donated property interest is equal to or
greater than the required fee. If the appraised value of the donated property
457
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C Article V
03/03/2015
interest is less than the required fee calculated pursuant to 15A NCAC 02B .0273,

otherwise fall within the scope of one or more of the definitions or uses of the words or phrases air navigation
facility, airport, or airport protection privileges under G.S. 63-1; the definition of aeronautical facilities
in G.S. 63-79(1); the phrase airport facilities as used in G.S. 159-48(b)(1); the phrase aeronautical
facilities as defined in G.S. 159-81 and G.S. 159-97; and the phrase airport facilities and improvements as
used in Article V, Section 13, of the North Carolina Constitution, which shall include, without limitation,
any and all of the following: airports, airport maintenance facilities, any aeronautic industrial facilities that
require direct access to the airfield, clear zones, drainage ditches, fields, hangars, landing lighting, airport
and airport-related offices, parking facilities, related navigational and signal systems, runways, stormwater
outfalls, terminals, terminal shops, and all appurtenant areas used or suitable for airport buildings or other
airport facilities, and all appurtenant rights-of-way; restricted landing areas; any structures, mechanisms,
lights, beacons, marks, communicating systems, or other instrumentalities or devices used or useful as an aid,
or constituting an advantage or convenience to the safe taking off, navigation, and landing of aircraft, or the
safe and efficient operation or maintenance of an airport or restricted landing area; easements through, or
interests in, air space over land or water, interests in airport hazards outside the boundaries of airports or
restricted landing areas, and other protection privileges, the acquisition or control of which is necessary to
ensure safe approaches to the landing areas of airports and restricted landing areas, and the safe and efficient
operation thereof and any combination of any or all of such facilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
following shall not be included in the definition of airport facilities:
1. Satellite parking facilities;
462
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C Article V
03/03/2015
2. Retail and commercial development outside of the terminal area, such as rental car facilities; and
3. Other secondary development, such as hotels, industrial facilities, free-standing offices and other
similar buildings, so long as these facilities are not directly associated with the operation of the
airport, and are not operated by a unit of government or special governmental entity such as an
airport authority, in which case they are included in the definition of airport facilities.
Channel means a natural water-carrying trough cut vertically into low areas of the land surface by erosive
action of concentrated flowing water or a ditch or canal excavated for the flow of water.
DBH means diameter at breast height of a tree measured at 4.5 feet above ground surface level.
Development means the same as defined in Rule 15A NCAC 2B .0202(23).
Ditch or canal means a man-made channel other than a modified natural stream constructed for drainage
purposes that is typically dug through inter-stream divide areas. A ditch or canal may have flows that are
perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral and may exhibit hydrological and biological characteristics similar to
perennial or intermittent streams.
Ephemeral stream means a feature that carries only stormwater in direct response to precipitation with
water flowing only during and shortly after large precipitation events. An ephemeral stream may or may not
have a well-defined channel, the aquatic bed is always above the water table, and stormwater runoff is the
primary source of water. An ephemeral stream typically lacks the biological, hydrological, and physical
characteristics commonly associated with the continuous or intermittent conveyance of water.
Existing development means development, other than that associated with agricultural or forest
management activities that meets one of the following criteria:
1. It either is built or has established a vested right based on statutory or common law as interpreted
by the courts, for projects that do not require a state permit, as of the effective date of either local
new development stormwater programs implemented under Rule 15A NCAC 2B .0265 (Jordan
Water Supply Nutrient Strategy: Stormwater Management for New Development) or, for projects
requiring a state permit, as of the applicable compliance date established in Rule 15A NCAC 2B
.0271 (Jordan Water Supply Nutrient Strategy: Stormwater Management for New Development),
Items (5) and (6); or
2. It occurs after the compliance date set out in Sub-Item (4) (d) of Rule .0265 (Jordan Water Supply
Nutrient Strategy: Stormwater Management for New Development) but does not result in a net
increase in built-upon area.
Greenway / Hiking Trails means pedestrian trails constructed of pervious or impervious surfaces and
related structures including but not limited to boardwalks, steps, rails, and signage, and that generally run
parallel to the shoreline.
High Value Tree means a tree that meets or exceeds the following standards: for pine species, 14-inch
DBH or greater or 18-inch or greater stump diameter; or for hardwoods and wetland species, 16-inch DBH
or greater or 24-inch or greater stump diameter.
Intermittent stream means a well-defined channel that contains water for only part of the year, typically
during winter and spring when the aquatic bed is below the water table. The flow may be heavily
supplemented by stormwater runoff. An intermittent stream often lacks the biological and hydrological
characteristics commonly associated with the continuous conveyance of water.
Jordan nutrient strategy or Jordan water supply nutrient strategy means the set of Rules 15A NCAC
2B .0262 through .0273 and .0311(p).
463
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C Article V
03/03/2015
Jordan Reservoir means the surface water impoundment operated by the US Army Corps of Engineers
and named B. Everett Jordan Reservoir, as further delineated for purposes of the Jordan nutrient strategy in
Rule 15A NCAC 2B .0262(4).
Jordan watershed means all lands and waters draining to B. Everett Jordan Reservoir.
New Development means any development project that does not meet the definition of existing
development set out in this Ordinance. Perennial stream means a well-defined channel that contains water
year round during a year of normal rainfall with the aquatic bed located below the water table for most of the
year. Groundwater is the primary source of water for a perennial stream, but it also carries stormwater runoff.
A perennial stream exhibits the typical biological, hydrological, and physical characteristics commonly
associated with the continuous conveyance of water.
Perennial waterbody means a natural or man-made basin, including lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, that
stores surface water permanently at depths sufficient to preclude growth of rooted plants. For the purpose of
the States riparian buffer protection program, the waterbody must be part of a natural drainage way (i.e.,
connected by surface flow to a stream).
Shoreline stabilization is the in-place stabilization of an eroding shoreline. Stabilization techniques which
include soft methods or natural materials (such as root wads, or rock vanes) may be considered as part of
a restoration design. However, stabilization techniques that consist primarily of hard engineering, such as
concrete lined channels, riprap, or gabions, while providing bank stabilization, shall not be considered stream
restoration.
Stream restoration is defined as the process of converting an unstable, altered or degraded stream corridor,
including adjacent riparian zone and flood-prone areas to its natural or referenced, stable conditions
considering recent and future watershed conditions. This process also includes restoring the geomorphic
dimension, pattern, and profile as well as biological and chemical integrity, including transport of water and
sediment produced by the streams watershed in order to achieve dynamic equilibrium. Referenced or
referenced reach means a stable stream that is in dynamic equilibrium with its valley and contributing
watershed. A reference reach can be used to develop natural channel design criteria for stream restoration
projects.
Stream means a body of concentrated flowing water in a natural low area or natural channel on the land
surface.
Stump diameter means the diameter of a tree measured at six inches above the ground surface level.
Surface waters means all waters of the state as defined in G.S. 143-212 except underground waters
Tree means a woody plant with a DBH equal to or exceeding five inches or a stump diameter exceeding
six inches.
Temporary road means a road constructed temporarily for equipment access to build or replace hydraulic
conveyance structures such as bridges, culverts, pipes or water dependent structures, or to maintain public
traffic during construction.

Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C  Article VI
6-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
6-1.1 AUTHORITY
This Ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authority vested in the Town of Kernersville by the Session Laws
and the General Statutes of North Carolina, particularly N.C Gen. Stat §153A-121, 153A-140, Chapter 153A,
Article 18, N.C. Gen. Stat §160A-174, 160A-193, Chapter 160A, Article 19, and any special legislation
enacted by the General Assembly for the Town of Kernersville.
6-1.2 PURPOSE AND INTENT
The purpose of the Town of Kernersville in adopting the following Ordinance is to protect and preserve
existing riparian buffers throughout the Randleman Lake Watershed as generally described in Rule 15A
NCAC 02B .0250 (Randleman Lake Water Supply Watershed: Protection and Maintenance of Existing
Riparian Buffers), in order to maintain their nutrient removal and stream protection functions. Additionally,
this Ordinance will help protect the water supply uses of Randleman Lake Reservoir and of designated water
supplies throughout the Randleman Lake watershed.
Buffers adjacent to streams provide multiple environmental protection and resource management benefits.
Forested buffers enhance and protect the natural ecology of stream systems, as well as water quality through
bank stabilization, shading, and nutrient removal. They also help to minimize flood damage in flood prone
areas. Well-vegetated streamside riparian areas help to remove nitrogen and prevent sediment and sedimentbound
pollutants such as phosphorous from reaching the streams.
6-1.3 TITLE
This Ordinance shall be known as the Town of Kernersville Riparian Buffer Protection Ordinance for Lands
within the Randleman Lake Watershed.
6-1.4 JURISDICTION
This Ordinance shall be applied to all land in the planning jurisdiction of the Town of Kernersville that is
located within the Randleman Lake Reservoir Watershed.
6-1.5 APPLICABILITY
This Ordinance applies to all landowners and other persons conducting activities in the area described in
Section 4, with the exception of activities conducted under the authority of the State, the United States,
multiple jurisdictions, or local units of government, and forest harvesting and agricultural activities. The NC
Division of Water Resources shall administer the requirements of Rule 15A NCAC 02B .0250 and .0295
(Randleman Lake Water Supply Watershed: Protection and Maintenance of Existing Riparian Buffers and
Mitigation Program Requirements for Protection and Maintenance of Riparian Buffers, respectively) for
these activities.
6-1.6 RELATION TO OTHER ORDINANCES
The requirements of this Ordinance shall supersede all locally implemented buffer requirements stated in
Rules 15A NCAC 02B .0214 through .0216 as applied to WS-II, WS-III, and WS-IV waters in the Randleman
Lake watershed. If the provisions of this ordinance otherwise conflict with the provisions of any other validly
enforceable ordinance(s) or laws, the most stringent provisions shall control. This Ordinance is not intended
to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law.
The existing water supply requirement in rule .0216(3)(b) of the 15A NCAC Subchapter 02B that stipulates
a 100-foot vegetated buffer, adjacent to perennial streams, for all new development activities which utilize
the high density option, applies to the entire Randleman Lake watershed. The first 50 feet of these riparian
areas on either side of these waters must also be protected in accordance with all the requirements of this
Ordinance.
6-1.7 RIPARIAN AREA PROTECTION WITHIN THE RANDLEMAN LAKE RESERVOIR
WATERSHED
466
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C  Article VI
A. Buffers Protected
The following minimum criteria shall be used for identifying regulated buffers:
1. This Ordinance shall apply to activities conducted within 50-foot wide riparian buffers
directly adjacent to surface waters in the Randleman Lake watershed (intermittent streams,
perennial streams, lakes, reservoirs, ponds and specified ditches), excluding wetlands.
2. Wetlands adjacent to surface waters or within 50 feet of surface waters shall be considered
as part of the riparian buffer but are regulated pursuant to Rules 15A NCAC 2B .0230 and
.0231, Rules 15A NCAC 2H .0500, 15A NCAC 2H .1300, and Sections 401 and 404 of
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.
3. For the purpose of this Ordinance, surface waters shall be subject to the requirements of
this Ordinance if they are approximately shown on any of the following references, or if
there is other site specific evidence that indicates to the Town of Kernersville the presence
of waters not shown on any of these maps:
a. The most recent version of the hardcopy soil survey maps prepared by the Natural
Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture.
b. The most recent version of the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) 1:24,000
scale (7.5 minute) quadrangle topographic maps.
c. A map approved by the Geographic Information Coordinating Council and by the
NC Environmental Management Commission. Prior to approving a map under
this Item, the Commission shall provide a 30-day public notice and opportunity
for comment.
d. A map developed by the local government and approved by the NC
Environmental Management Commission per 15A NCAC 02B .0250(4) (c).
4. Where the specific origination point of a stream regulated under this Item is in question,
upon request of the NC Division of Water Resources or another party, the Town of
Kernersville shall make an on-site determination. A Town of Kernersville representative
who has successfully completed the Divisions Surface Water Identification Training
Certification course (SWITC), its successor, or other equivalent training curriculum
approved by the Division, shall establish that point using the latest version of the Division
publication, Identification Methods for the Origins of Intermittent and Perennial Streams.
More information is available from the NC Division of Water Resources - 401 & Buffer
Permitting Branch, or its successor. The Town of Kernersville may accept the results of a
site assessment made by another party who meets these criteria. Any disputes over on-site
determinations made according to this Item shall be referred to the Director of the Division
of Water Resources c/o the 401 & Buffer Permitting Branch, or its successor, in writing.
The Directors determination is subject to review as provided in Articles 3 and 4 of G.S.
150B.
5. Parties subject to this Ordinance shall abide by all State rules and laws regarding waters of
the state including but not limited to Rules 15A NCAC 2B .0230 and .0231, Rules 15A
NCAC 2H .0500, 15A NCAC 2H .1300, and Sections 401 and 404 of the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act.
B. Exemption Based on Onsite Determination
When a landowner or other affected party including the Division and the Town believes that the
maps have inaccurately depicted surface waters, he or she shall consult the Town of Kernersville.
Upon request, a Town of Kernersville representative who has successfully completed the Division
of Water Qualitys Surface Water Identification Training Certification course, its successor, or other
equivalent training curriculum approved by the Division, shall make an on-site determination. The
Town of Kernersville may also accept the results of site assessments made by other parties who
have successfully completed such training. Any disputes over on-site determinations shall be
referred to the Director of the Division of Water Resources c/o the 401 & Buffer Permitting Branch,
or its successor, in writing. A determination by the Director as to the accuracy or application of the
maps is subject to review as provided in Articles 3 and 4 of G.S. 150B. Surface waters that appear
on the maps shall not be subject to these buffer requirements if a site evaluation reveals any of the
following cases:
467
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C  Article VI
a. Ditches and manmade conveyances, to include manmade stormwater conveyances, other
than modified natural streams, unless the ditch or manmade conveyance delivers untreated
stormwater runoff from an adjacent source directly to an intermittent or perennial stream.
b. Areas mapped as intermittent streams, perennial streams, lakes, ponds, or estuaries on the
most recent versions of the United States Geological Survey 1:24,000 scale (7.5 minute
quadrangle) topographic maps, hard-copy soil survey maps, or other EMC approved stream
maps where no perennial waterbody, intermittent waterbody, lake, pond, or estuary actually
exists on the ground.
c. Ephemeral streams.
d. Ponds and lakes created for animal watering, irrigation, or other agricultural uses that are
not part of a natural drainage way that is classified in accordance with 15A NCAC 02B
.0100. Ponds are part of the natural drainage way when they are hydrologically connected
(i.e. the pond is fed by an intermittent or perennial stream) or when they have a direct
discharge point to an intermittent or perennial stream.
C. Exemption when Existing Uses are Present and Ongoing
This Ordinance shall not apply to uses that are existing and ongoing; however, this Ordinance shall
apply at the time an existing, ongoing use is changed to another use. Change of use shall involve
the initiation of any activity that does not meet either of the following criteria for existing, ongoing
activity:
1. It was present within the riparian buffer as of the effective date of the original Ordinance.
Existing uses shall include agriculture, buildings, industrial facilities, commercial areas,
transportation facilities, maintained lawns, utility lines and on-site sanitary sewage
systems, any of which involve either specific, periodic management of vegetation or
displacement of vegetation by structures or regular activity. Only the portion of the riparian
buffer occupied by the footprint of the existing use is exempt from this Ordinance. Change
of ownership through purchase or inheritance is not a change of use. Activities necessary
to maintain uses are allowed provided that the site remains similarly vegetated, no
impervious surface is added within 50 feet of the surface water where it did not previously
exist as of the effective date of this Ordinance, and existing diffuse flow is maintained.
Grading and revegetating Zone Two is allowed provided that the health of the vegetation
in Zone One is not compromised, the ground is stabilized, and existing diffuse flow is
maintained.
2. Projects or proposed development that are determined by the Town of Kernersville to meet
at least one of the following criteria:
a. Project requires a 401 Certification/404 Permit and these were issued prior to the
effective date this Ordinance, and prior to the effective date of this Ordinance.
b. Projects that require a state permit, such as landfills, NPDES wastewater
discharges, land application of residuals and road construction activities, have
begun construction or are under contract to begin construction and had received
all required state permits and certifications prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance;
c. Projects that are being reviewed through the Clean Water Act Section
404/National Environmental Policy Act Merger 01 Process (published by the US
Army Corps of Engineers and Federal Highway Administration, 2003) or its
immediate successor and that have reached agreement with DENR on avoidance
and minimization by the effective date of this Ordinance; or
d. Projects that are not required to be reviewed by the Clean Water Act Section
404/National Environmental Policy Act Merger 01 Process (published by the US
Army Corps of Engineers and Federal Highway Administration, 2003) or its
immediate successor if a Finding of No Significant Impact has been issued for the
project and the project has the written approval of the Town of Kernersville prior
to the effective date of this Ordinance.
D. Zones of the Riparian Buffer
468
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C  Article VI
The protected riparian buffer shall have two zones as follows:
1. Zone One shall consist of a vegetated area that is undisturbed except for uses provided for
in the Table of Uses, Section 8. (B) of this Ordinance. The location of Zone One shall be
as follows:
a. For intermittent and perennial streams, Zone One shall begin at the top of the bank
and extend landward a distance of 30 feet on all sides of the surface water,
measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to a vertical line marking the top of
the bank.
b. For ponds, lakes and reservoirs located within a natural drainage way, Zone One
shall begin at the normal water level and extend landward a distance of 30 feet,
measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to a vertical line marking the
normal water level.
2. Zone Two shall consist of a stable, vegetated area that is undisturbed except for uses
provided for in the Table of Uses, Section 8. (B) of this Ordinance. Grading and
revegetating in Zone Two is allowed provided that the health of the vegetation in Zone One
is not compromised. Zone Two shall begin at the outer edge of Zone One and extend
landward 20 feet as measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface water.
The combined width of Zones One and Two shall be 50 feet on all sides of the surface
water.
E. Diffuse Flow Requirements
Diffuse flow of runoff shall be maintained in the riparian buffer by dispersing concentrated flow prior
to its entry into the buffer and reestablishing vegetation as follows:
1. Concentrated runoff from new ditches or man-made conveyances shall be converted to
diffuse flow at non-erosive velocities before the runoff enters Zone Two of the riparian
buffer;
2. Periodic corrective action to restore diffuse flow shall be taken as necessary and shall be
designed to impede the formation of erosion gullies; and
3. As set out in Sections 7.(D) and 8.(B) of this Ordinance, The Zones of the Riparian Buffer
and Table of Uses respectively, no new stormwater conveyances are allowed through the
buffers except for those specified in the Table of Uses, Section 8.(B) of this Ordinance,
addressing stormwater management ponds, drainage ditches, roadside ditches, and
stormwater conveyances.
6-1.8 POTENTIAL USES AND ASSOCIATED REQUIREMENTS

shall prepare preliminary findings and submit them to the Division of Water Resources,
401 & Buffer Permitting Branch, or its successor for approval by the Environmental
Management Commission. The variance request procedure shall be as follows:
a. For any variance request, the Town of Kernersville shall make a finding of fact as
to whether there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that prevent
compliance with the riparian buffer protection requirements. A finding of
practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships shall require that the following
conditions are met:
i. If the applicant complies with the provisions of this Ordinance, he/she
can secure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, his/her
property. Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit
from the property shall not be considered adequate justification for a
variance. Moreover, the Town of Kernersville shall consider whether
the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this
Ordinance that shall make reasonable use of the property possible;
ii. The hardship results from application of this Ordinance to the property
rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship;
iii. The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicants property,
such as its size, shape, or topography, such that compliance with
provisions of this ordinance would not allow reasonable use of the
property;
iv. The applicant did not cause the hardship by knowingly or unknowingly
violating this Ordinance;
v. The hardship is rare or unique to the applicants property.
b. The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the States
riparian buffer protection requirements and this Ordinance and preserves its spirit;
and
c. In granting the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured, water
quality has been protected, and substantial justice has been done.
2. Minor Variances
A minor variance request pertains to activities that will impact only Zone Two of the
riparian buffer. Minor variance requests shall be reviewed and approved based on the
criteria in Section 9. (A)(1) through Section 9. (A)(3) by the Town of Kernersville pursuant
to G.S. 153A-Article 18, or G.S. 160A-Article 19. The Town of Kernersville may attach
conditions to the variance approval that support the purpose, spirit and intent of the riparian
buffer protection program. Request for appeals to decisions made by the Town of
Kernersville shall be made in writing to the Director of the Division of Water Resources
c/o the 401 & Buffer Permitting Branch, or its successor. The Directors decision is subject
to review as provided in G.S. 150B Articles 3 and 4.
3. Major Variances
A major variance request pertains to activities that will impact any portion of Zone One or
any portion of both Zones One and Two of the riparian buffer. If Town of Kernersville has
determined that a major variance request meets the requirements in Section 9.(B)(1)), then
it shall prepare a preliminary finding and submit it to the NC Environmental Management
Commission c/o the Division of Water Resources, 401 & Buffer Permitting Branch, or its
successor, for approval. Within 90 days after receipt by Town of Kernersville, the
Commission shall review preliminary findings on major variance requests and take one of
the following actions: approve, approve with conditions and stipulations, or deny the
request. Appeals from a Commission decision on a major variance request are made on
judicial review to Superior Court.

Section 9. (A) of this Ordinance and is required to perform mitigation as a
condition of the authorization certificate; or
(b) The applicant has received a variance pursuant to Section 9. (B) of this Ordinance
and is required to perform mitigation as a condition of a variance approval.
Any applicant covered under this Paragraph shall submit to the Town of Kernersville a
written mitigation proposal that calculates the required area of mitigation and describes the
area and location of each type of proposed mitigation. The applicant shall not impact
buffers until the Town of Kernersville approves the mitigation plan and issues written
approval.
(3) Area of Impact. The Town of Kernersville shall determine the area of impact in square
feet to each Zone as defined by this Ordinance by adding the following:
(a) The area of the footprint of the use impacting the riparian buffer;
(b) The area of the boundary of any clearing and grading activities within the riparian
buffer necessary to accommodate the use; and
(c) The area of any ongoing maintenance corridors within the riparian buffer
associated with the use. The Town of Kernersville shall deduct from this total the
area of any wetlands that are subject to and compliant with riparian wetland
mitigation requirements under 15A NCAC 02H .0506 and are located within the
proposed riparian buffer impact area.
(4) Area of Mitigation Required on Zonal Mitigation Ratios. The Town of Kernersville
shall determine the required area of mitigation for each Zone by applying each of the
following ratios or multipliers to the area of impact calculated under Paragraph (3) of this
section:
Basin/Watershed Zone 1 Ratio Zone 2 Ratio
Randleman Lake Watershed (15A NCAC 02B .0250) 3:1 1.5:1
(5) Area of Mitigation Required on Locational Mitigation Ratios. The applicant shall use
the following locational ratios as applicable based on location of the proposed mitigation
site relative to that of the proposed impact site. Locational ratios shall be as follows:
Location Ratio
Within the 12-digit HUC 1:1
Within the eight-digit HUCA 1:1
Outside of the eight-digit HUCA 2:1
A Except as provided in Paragraph (6) of this Rule.
(6) Geographic Restrictions on Location of Mitigation. Mitigation shall be performed in
the same river basin where the impact is located with the following additional specification:
479
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C  Article VI
Mitigation shall be performed in the same watershed where the impact is located as defined
in Rule .0248 of the 15A NCAC 02B Section.
(7) Mitigation Options for Applicants. The applicant may propose any of the following
types of mitigation:
(a) Riparian buffer restoration or enhancement pursuant to Paragraph (13) of this
Section;
(b) Payment of a compensatory mitigation fee to a compensatory buffer mitigation
bank pursuant to Paragraph (8) of this Section or payment of a compensatory
mitigation fee to the Riparian Buffer Restoration Fund pursuant to Paragraph (9)
of this Section. Payment shall conform to the requirements of G.S. 143-214.20;
(c) Donation of real property or of an interest in real property pursuant to Paragraph
(10) of this Rule;
(d) Alternative buffer mitigation pursuant to Paragraph (14) of this Section; or
(e) Other buffer mitigation as approved by the Environmental Management
Commission as a condition of a variance approval.
(8) Purchase of Buffer Mitigation Credits from a Private or Public Compensatory Buffer
Mitigation Bank. Applicants who choose to satisfy some or all of their mitigation by
purchasing mitigation credits from a private or public compensatory buffer mitigation bank
shall meet the following requirements:
(a) The compensatory buffer mitigation bank from which credits are purchased shall
have available riparian buffer credits approved by the Division;
(b) The compensatory buffer mitigation bank from which credits are purchased shall
be located as described in Paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of this Section; and
(c) After receiving a mitigation acceptance letter from the compensatory buffer
mitigation bank, proof of payment for the credits shall be provided to the Town of
Kernersville prior to any activity that results in the removal or degradation of the
protected riparian buffer.
(9) Payment to the Riparian Buffer Restoration Fund. Applicants who choose to satisfy
some or all of their mitigation requirement by paying a compensatory mitigation fee to the
Riparian Buffer Restoration Fund shall meet the requirements of Rule .0601 of the 15A
NCAC 02R Section. Payment made to the NC Division of Mitigation Services(DMS) shall
be contingent upon acceptance of the payment by the DMS. The DMS shall consider their
financial, temporal, and technical ability to satisfy the mitigation request to determine
whether they shall accept or deny the request.
(10) Donation of Property. Applicants who choose to satisfy their mitigation requirement by
donating real property or an interest in real property to fully or partially offset an approved
payment into the Riparian Buffer Restoration Fund pursuant to Paragraph (9) of this
Section shall do so in accordance with 15A NCAC 02R .0403.
(11) Mitigation Site Requirements for Applicants. For each mitigation site proposed by an
applicant under Paragraphs (13) of this Rule, the Town of Kernersville shall identify
functional criteria to measure the anticipated benefits of the mitigation to the adjacent
water. The Town of Kernersville shall issue a mitigation determination that specifies the
area, type, and location of mitigation and the water quality benefits to be provided by the
mitigation site. All mitigation proposals shall meet the following criteria:
(a) The location of the buffer mitigation site shall comply with the requirements of
Paragraphs (5) and (6) of this Section
(b) The mitigation proposal shall include a commitment to provide:

Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C  Article VI
? a perpetual conservation easement or similar preservation mechanism to
ensure perpetual stewardship that protects the mitigation site's nutrient
removal and other water quality functions;
? a non-wasting endowment or other dedicated financial surety to provide
for the perpetual land management and hydrological maintenance of
lands and maintenance of structures as applicable; and
? financial assurance in the form of a completion bond, credit insurance,
letter of credit, escrow, or other vehicle acceptable to the Town of
Kernersville payable to, or for the benefit of, the Town of Kernersville
in an amount sufficient to ensure that the property is secured in fee title
or by easement, and that planting or construction, monitoring and
maintenance are completed as necessary to meet success criteria as
specified in the approved mitigation plan. This financial assurance
obligation shall not apply to the NC DMS.
(c) Diffuse flow of runoff shall be maintained in the riparian buffer. Any existing
impervious cover or stormwater conveyances such as ditches, pipes, or drain tiles
shall be eliminated and the flow converted to diffuse flow. If the applicant
determines that elimination of existing stormwater conveyances is not feasible,
then they shall include a justification and shall provide a delineation of the
watershed draining to the stormwater outfall and the percentage of the total
drainage by area treated by the riparian buffer with the mitigation plan specified
in Paragraph (13) of this Rule for Town of Kernersville approval. During
mitigation plan review and approval, the Town of Kernersville may reduce credit
proportionally.
(d) Sewer easement within the buffer. If the proposed mitigation site contains a sewer
easement in Zone 1, that portion of the sewer easement within Zone 1 shall not be
suitable for buffer mitigation credit. If the proposed mitigation site contains a
sewer easement in Zone 2, the portion of the sewer easement in Zone 2 may be
suitable for buffer mitigation credit if:
? the applicant restores or enhances the forested buffer in Zone 1 adjacent
to the sewer easement;

? Buffer mitigation credit shall not be generated within wetlands that
provide wetland mitigation credit required by 15A NCAC 02H .0506;
and
? Buffer mitigation credit may be generated on stream mitigation sites as
long as the width of the restored or enhanced riparian buffer meets the
requirements of Subparagraph (13)(a) of this Rule.
(12) Riparian Buffer Mitigation Units. Mitigation activities shall generate riparian buffer
mitigation units as follows:
Mitigation Activity Square Feet of
Mitigation Buffer
Riparian Buffer
Mitigation Units Generated

make an on-site determination as to whether a potential mitigation site qualifies as a
481
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C  Article VI
restoration site or enhancement site as defined in Section (14) Definitions of this Rule.
Riparian buffer restoration sites or enhancement sites shall meet the following
requirements:
(a) Buffer restoration sites or enhancement sites may be proposed as follows:
Buffer width (ft)
Proposed
Percentage of
Full Credit
Less than 20 0 %
20-29 75 %
30-100 100 %
101-200 33%
(b) The applicant shall submit a restoration or enhancement mitigation plan to the
Town of Kernersville for written approval. The plan shall demonstrate
compliance with the requirements of this Paragraph and Paragraphs (11) and (12)
of this Rule and shall also contain the following:
? A map of the proposed restoration or enhancement site;
? A vegetation plan that shall detail the activities proposed to ensure a final
performance standard of 260 stems per acre at the completion of
monitoring. The final performance standard shall include a minimum of
four native hardwood tree species or four native hardwood tree and
native shrub species, where no one species is greater than 50 percent of
stems. Native hardwood and native shrub volunteer species may be
included to meet the final performance standard of 260 stems per acre.
The Town of Kernersville may approve alternative vegetation plans upon
consideration of factors, including site wetness and plant availability, to
meet the requirements of this Part;
? A grading plan (if applicable). The site shall be graded in a manner to
ensure diffuse flow through the entire riparian buffer;
? A schedule for implementation, including a fertilization and herbicide
plan if applicable; and
? A monitoring plan to document whether the site is expected to meet the
final performance standards as defined above and other anticipated
benefits to the adjacent water. The plan shall include a proposed schedule
and method for monitoring the vegetative status of the restoration or
enhancement site for five years, including the health and average stem
densities of native hardwood tree or tree and shrub species that are to be
counted toward the final performance standard.
(c) Within one year after Town of Kernersville approval of the mitigation plan, the
applicant shall present documentation to the Town of Kernersville that the riparian
buffer has been restored or enhanced unless the applicant requests, and the Town
of Kernersville agrees in writing prior to that date, to a longer time period.
(d) The applicant shall submit written annual reports, unless an alternative schedule
has been approved by the Town of Kernersville during the mitigation plan
approval for a period of five years after completion of the activities identified in
Part (13)(b) of this Rule at the restoration site or enhancement site showing:
? compliance with the monitoring plan approved pursuant to Part (13)(b)
of this Rule; and
? that diffuse flow through the riparian buffer has been maintained.
If the Town of Kernersville determines that the native hardwood tree or tree and
shrub species at the site are not expected to meet the final performance standards
listed in Part (13)(b) of this Rule, then the Town of Kernersville may require that
the applicant replaces trees or trees and shrubs as needed during that five-year
482
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter C  Article VI
period. If the Town of Kernersville determines that diffuse flow through the buffer
is not being maintained, then the Town of Kernersville may require that the
applicant restores diffuse flow. If the Town of Kernersville determines that the
final performance standards listed in Part (13)(b) of this Rule have not been
achieved at the end of the five-year monitoring period, the Town of Kernersville
may require additional years of monitoring. The Town of Kernersville shall make
determinations referenced in this Subparagraph on a site specific basis based on
the annual reports, any supplemental information submitted by the applicant, or a
site evaluation by the Town of Kernersville.
(14) Alternative Buffer Mitigation Options. Any proposal for alternative buffer mitigation
shall be provided in writing to the Division and shall meet the content and procedural
requirements for approval by the Division. Alternative buffer mitigation options that are

conveyance of water.
Perennial waterbody means a natural or man-made basin, including lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, that
stores surface water permanently at depths sufficient to preclude growth of rooted plants. For the purpose of
the States riparian buffer protection program, the waterbody must be part of a natural drainage way (i.e.,
connected by surface flow to a stream).
Preservation Site means riparian zone sites that, as determined by a site visit conducted by the Town of
Kernersville or the Division, are characterized by a forest consisting of the forest strata and diversity of
species appropriate for the location.
Restoration Site means riparian zone sites that are characterized by an absence of trees and by a lack of
dense growth of smaller woody stems (i.e., shrubs or saplings) or sites that are characterized by scattered

concrete lined channels, riprap, or gabions, while providing bank stabilization, shall not be considered stream
restoration.
Stem means a woody seedling, sapling, shrub, or tree, no less than 10 centimeters in height.
Stream restoration is defined as the process of converting an unstable, altered or degraded stream
corridor, including adjacent riparian zone and flood-prone areas to its natural or referenced, stable conditions
considering recent and future watershed conditions. This process also includes restoring the geomorphic
dimension, pattern, and profile as well as biological and chemical integrity, including transport of water and
sediment produced by the streams watershed in order to achieve dynamic equilibrium. Referenced or
referenced reach means a stable stream that is in dynamic equilibrium with its valley and contributing
watershed. A reference reach can be used to develop natural channel design criteria for stream restoration
projects.

of, a subdivided part of the original zoning lot as permitted in this Ordinance is transferred
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter D  Subdivision 494 Regulations
to, or is retained by, the remaining portion of the original zoning lot. Development of each
subdivided part pursuant to the terms of the writing shall meet or exceed the requirements
of this Ordinance. The writing shall further provide that the allocation of development
rights shall be appurtenant to and run with the land so benefitted and have the effect of
imposing a negative easement or restriction upon the servient land.
(3) Approval of Plat. The writing constituting the reallocation of development rights must
include, or be represented by, a plat illustrating the reallocation. To be effective, the
writing and plat shall be reviewed for compliance with this Ordinance by the Review

SUBDIVISION APPROVAL
This section lists development standards and requirements for preliminary subdivision approval.
However, subdividers are invited to discuss ideas and special development problems with
Community Development Staff before preparing and submitting proposals for preliminary
subdivision approval.
(1) Streets or Roads
(a) All streets or roads shall be designed to become parts of the major street or road
system of the jurisdiction and County, as shown on adopted plans. These streets
or roads shall be coterminous with adjoining links in said system.
(b) All subdivisions shall be accessed by public streets. No subdivision will be
permitted access via private streets. All streets inside preliminary subdivisions
and subdivisions with final plats shall be public streets. No private streets shall
be allowed inside the subdivision except those developments where private streets
have been approved in accordance with the Unified Development Ordinances.
(c) Dedication of additional rights-of-way, widening, or other improvements to
existing public streets upon which the property fronts or which provide access to
new subdivisions may be required of the developer.
(d) All streets within the zoning jurisdiction of the Town of Kernersville shall meet
the Town of Kernersville Design and Construction Specifications (Dated
December 6, 2016).
(e) Except as provided for herein, all subdivisions shall be designed to utilize
interconnecting streets for a consistent development pattern within the Town. The
Board of Aldermen may provide for exemption from this requirement only:
(i) In cases of major streams, bodies of water, extreme height or depth of
property, or other physical barrier(s), the crossing of which would
provide prohibitive costs and/or extreme construction difficulties and/or
detriment to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Town.
(ii) In cases of an interconnection between a residentially zoned district and
a commercially zoned district which would detrimentally affect the
health, safety, or welfare of the citizens of the Town.
(iii) Physical connection of streets may be delayed based upon specific
findings of fact by the Board of Aldermen that a specific traffic safety
issue(s) of concern exists that can be rectified, abated, or eliminated by
delaying the connection of streets in the new development to existing
streets. Findings of fact for the delayed connections shall consider
findings from a traffic report prepared by the Town Manager and staff,
which shall be included in the staff report, which includes a review of:
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter D  Subdivision 496 Regulations
(1) Emergency Response Times: How much a street connection may
decrease emergency response times or enhance emergency vehicle
access.
(2) Excessive Block Lengths: Evaluate current neighborhood block
lengths and determine if a street connection is needed.
(3) Traffic Congestion: Existing and/or anticipated street patterns
warrant a street connection(s) in order to reduce traffic congestion.
(4) Pedestrian: Existing street and sidewalk patterns warrant a street
connection(s) and or sidewalk connection(s) to enhance pedestrian
and bicyclist activities.
(5) Coordinated Street Plan: A street connection fits into adopted
street plans (Thoroughfare and Street Plan)
(6) Extraneous Traffic: Whether or not a proposed street
connection(s) would encourage traffic volumes with origins and
destinations outside the existing neighborhood or encourage truck
traffic to pass through the neighborhood.
In all cases where street connectivity is delayed, the developer shall
dedicate the necessary right-of-way and pay to the Town the estimated
current cost of the street construction required for the connection of the
streets. The current cost of the street construction for connectivity shall
be established by the Board of Aldermen after findings of fact with input
from the Public Services Department and Developer. The Town shall
then make the connection(s)of streets when the Board of Aldermen
determines that an acceptably safe connection(s) can be made.
The Public Services Director shall prepare a report on all projects that
have been delayed during the annual budget submittal process. The
report shall describe the current status of the connectivity and estimated
time of completion. The Town shall then make the connection(s)of
streets when the Board of Aldermen determines that an acceptably safe
connection(s) can be made.
In exceptional cases, the physical connection of streets may not be
required upon specific findings of fact by the Board of Aldermen that (1)
a specific safety issue(s) of concern exists that cannot be rectified,
abated, or eliminated and (2) the magnitude of the specific safety
issue(s) of concern outweighs the general policy and preference of street
connectivity.
Findings of fact for the exceptional cases regarding a specific safety
issue(s) shall consider findings from a traffic report prepared by the
Town Manager and staff that includes a review of
(1) Emergency Response Times: How much a street connection may
decrease emergency response times or enhance emergency vehicle
access.
(2) Traffic Congestion and Safety: Existing and/or anticipated street
patterns warrant a street connection(s) in order to reduce traffic
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter D  Subdivision 497 Regulations
congestion and safety.
(3) Extraneous Traffic: Whether or not a proposed street connection(s)
would encourage traffic volumes with origins and destinations
outside the existing neighborhood or encourage truck traffic to pass
through the neighborhood.
The findings of fact for an exceptional case shall include more than additional
traffic on a residential street.
In all cases of exemption from the interconnecting streets requirement, the Board
of Aldermen shall make findings of facts commensurate with its approval of
exemption.
The Board of Aldermen may place such other conditions or regulations for the
development of the subdivision as the Board of Aldermen may deem proper for
the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Town, including but not limited
to requiring pedestrian interconnections.
(f) All subdivisions shall dedicate right-of-way and construct stub streets to any
adjoining properties to facilitate traffic circulation within the context of the overall
transportation network. All stub streets shall meet the design and construction
criteria required by each governmental jurisdiction and shall either be constructed
to the property line or have the costs of construction guaranteed with a
performance surety before final plats are approved for the sections of the
subdivision where said streets are located. All stub streets shall be designed,
constructed, and placed in locations which will permit the future extension of
these streets. Any developments proposed adjacent to recorded but unbuilt stub
streets shall construct the stub street through to the nearest public street inside the
adjacent development. Any exemption from this regulation shall be based on the
length, cost, and construction difficulties of connecting stub streets to adjacent
developments resulting from natural topographic features, constructed
improvements, or existing or future location of streets or lots; such exemption
shall be decided by the Community Development Director as authorized in the
Town of Kernersville Design and Construction Specifications, Street Design
Standards (Dated December 6, 2016). Said exemption shall pertain to the
dedication of right-of-way and/or construction of the stub street.
(g) Blocks, or the distance between street intersections and street jogs with centerline
offsets shall be determined by considering topography, road classification, speed
design of road and projected traffic count.
(h) Except in unusual circumstances, cul-de-sacs or other dead-end streets, designed
to be so permanently, shall not be longer than twelve hundred (1,200) feet. When
topography prohibits the construction of a circular turn around a permanent Tshaped
turnaround may be considered.
(i) Sidewalks shall be required in all residential subdivisions where curb and gutter
streets are required.
(j) No subdivision showing reserved strips of land shall be recorded, except for Town
of Kernersville public streets that stub to adjacent unincorporated areas and
subdivisions for which, because of the depth of the land or the layout of streets, a
new street must be constructed linearly along another person's property line (stub
streets are excluded from this provision). In these cases, a one foot strip of land
Unified Development Ordinance Chapter D  Subdivision 498 Regulations
may be recorded on the final plat between the street and the adjoining property
line provided that a document for the sale of all or part of said strip of land to the
adjoining property owner shall be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds.
This document must provide for the sale of this land or any part of this land if the
adjoining property owner pays one-half the cost of constructing the street per
linear foot. The cost of the street must be approved by Community Development
Staff and may include engineering, grading, construction, and public utilities for
the affected street only. No provision can be made in the document for the resale
of this land or any part of this land at an inflated price. The resale price must be
the original cost of the improvements. The deed book and page number of this
recorded resale document must be shown on the final plat for this one-foot strip
of land.
(k) The reserve strip of land shall be five (5) feet in width and located within the
Town of Kernersville right-of-way. No access shall be made across the reserve
strip unless the adjacent unincorporated property is annexed into the Town of
Kernersville or the Board of Aldermen approve the removal of the reserve strip.
(2) Lots
(a) Lots shall conform to the Zoning Ordinance and any other applicable local or state
land regulatory ordinances.
(b) Subdivisions shall be designed to exclude any road frontage lots on major or
minor thoroughfares as shown on the adopted Transportation Plan. Said lots shall
be served internally within the subdivision and shall have no access to the major
roads. This requirement is consistent with the driveway policy of both the City of
Winston-Salem and the North Carolina Department of Transportation. Any
exemption from this regulation shall be based on hardships which arise from
