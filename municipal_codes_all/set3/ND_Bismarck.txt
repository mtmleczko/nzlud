CHAPTER 1-01. GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND DEFINITIONS
1-01-01. Code Designation and Citation. The ordinances embraced in the following titles, chapters and sections constitute and are designated the "Code of Ordinances, Bismarck, North Dakota," and may be so cited.
1-01-02. Rules of Interpretation. In the construction of this code the following rules shall apply unless it would be inconsistent with the intent of the city commission or the context of the provisions.
Title 1 2
1-01-03. Words and Phrases. All words and phrases shall be construed and understood according to the common and approved usage of language; but technical words and phrases and such others as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law shall be construed and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.
1-01-04. Clerical and Typographical Errors. Clerical and typographical errors shall be disregarded when the meaning of the Board is clear.
1-01-05. Particular Controls General. Whenever a general provision in a chapter is in conflict with a special provision in the same or other chapter, the two shall be construed, if possible, so that effect may be given to both provisions, but if the conflict between the two provisions is irreconcilable the special provision shall prevail and be construed as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision is enacted later and it is the manifest legislative intent that the general provision shall prevail.
1-01-06. Conflicting Provisions Found in the Same Chapter. Except as otherwise provided in section 1-01-05, whenever in a chapter several clauses are irreconcilable, the clause last in order of date or position shall prevail.
1-01-07. Multiple Amendments to the Same Provision, One Without Reference to the Other. If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at the same or different time, one amendment without reference to the other, the amendments are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the amendments are irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment prevails.
1-01-08. Code Not Retroactive Unless so Declared. No part of this code is retroactive unless it is expressly declared to be so.
1-01-09. Severability. In the event that any clause, sentence, paragraph, chapter or other part of any title is adjudged by any court of competent or final jurisdiction to be invalid, the judgment shall not affect, impair, nor invalidate any other clause, sentence, paragraph, chapter, section, or part of the title, but is confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which the judgment shall have been rendered.
1-01-10. Limitations - How Reckoned. When a limitation or period of time prescribed in any existing ordinance for acquiring a right or barring a remedy, or for any other purpose, has begun to run before this code goes into effect, and the same
Title 1 3
or any limitation of time is prescribed in this code, the time which already has run shall be deemed part of the time prescribed as such limitation by this code.
1-01-11. Time - How Computed. The time within which an act is to be done as provided in any ordinance or in any order issued pursuant to any ordinance, when expressed in days, is computed by excluding the first day and including the last, except that if the last day be Sunday or a legal holiday it is excluded; and when any such time is expressed in hours the whole of Sunday, from midnight to midnight, shall be excluded.
1-01-11.1. Actual Time Reference. For the purposes of any ordinance in which the actual time is a factor, the actual time shall be the time at the Centracom Series II Dispatch System located at the Bismarck/Burleigh Combined Communications Center.
(Ord. No. 4319, 3-27-90)
1-01-12. Office Held Under Provisions Repealed by This Code to be Retained - Exceptions. Unless a different intention plainly appears, a public officer who is in office when this code takes effect shall remain in office until the expiration of the term for which he or she was elected or appointed unless removed prior to the expiration of the term as provided by law.
1-01-13. Repeal Does Not Revive Act Previously Repealed. Whenever any act of the Board which repealed a former act is repealed, the former act shall not be revived by the appeal.
1-01-14. Effect Upon Former Laws - Repeals. No ordinance, law or rule is continued in force because it is consistent with the provisions of this code on the same subject, but in all cases provided for by this code all ordinances heretofore in force in the city, whether consistent or not with the provisions of this code, unless expressly continued in force by it, are all repealed and abrogated. This repeal or abrogation does not revive any former law heretofore repealed, nor does it affect any right already existing or accrued or any action or proceeding already taken, except as in this code provided.
1-01-15. Repeal - Effect. The repeal of any ordinance by the Board or by the people through an initiated ordinance shall not have the effect of releasing or extinguishing any penalty, fine, liability, or forfeiture incurred under such ordinance, but as to cases tried before, or subsequent to, the repeal of the ordinance it shall have the effect of extinguishing any jail or prison sentence that may be, or that has been, imposed by reason of said law, unless the repealing act shall provide expressly that the penalties of imprisonment shall remain in force as to crimes committed in violation of such law prior to its repeal. In other respects, such act shall remain in force only for the purpose of the enforcement of such fine, penalty or forfeiture.
Title 1 4
1-01-16. Pending Actions or Proceedings Not Affected by Code. No action or proceeding commenced before this code takes effect, and no right accrued, is affected by its provisions, but the proceedings therein must conform to the requirements of this code as far as applicable.
1-01-17. Catchlines, Titles, Headings and Notes. The catchlines of the several sections of this Code printed in boldface type, titles, headings, chapter heads, section and subsection heads or titles, editor's notes, cross references and state law references, unless set out in the body of the section itself, contained in this Code, do not constitute any part of the law, and are intended merely to indicate, explain, supplement or clarify the contents of a section.
1-01-18. Majority Power. Words giving a joint authority to three or more public officers or other persons shall be construed as giving such authority to a majority of them, unless it appears otherwise in the act giving the authority.
1-01-19. Conflicts Adjusted. If the provisions of any chapter or title conflict with or contravene the provisions of any other chapter or title, the provisions of each chapter or title must prevail as to all matters in question arising thereunder out of the same subject matter.
1-01-20. Delegation of Authority. Whenever a provision appears requiring an officer of the city to do some act or make certain inspections, it is to be construed to authorize the officer to designate, delegate and authorize subordinates to perform the required act or make the required inspection unless the terms of the provision or section designate otherwise.

CHAPTER 6-02. GENERAL OFFENSES
Title 6 4
6-02-01. Criminal Attempt.
1. A person is guilty of criminal attempt if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of an offense, that person intentionally engages in conduct which, in fact, constitutes a substantial step toward commission of the offense. A "substantial step" is any conduct which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor's intent to complete the commission of the offense. Factual or legal impossibility of committing the offense is not a defense, if it could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to be.
2. A person who engages in conduct intending to aid another to commit an offense is guilty of criminal attempt if the conduct would establish that person's complicity as an accomplice under NDCC Section 12.1-03-01 were the offense committed by the other person, even if the other is not guilty of committing or attempting the offense, for example, because the other has a defense of justification or entrapment.
3. Criminal attempt is an offense of the same class as the offense attempted.
4. Anything which constitutes an affirmative defense to prosecution under NDCC Sec. 12.1-06-01 is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under this section.
Reference: NDCC Sec. 12.1-06-01 (1985)
6-02-02. Aiding Consummation of Crime.

6-02-03. Public Servants Permitting Escape. A public servant concerned in official detention, as defined in NDCC Sec. 12.1-08-06(3), pursuant to process issued by a court, judge, or magistrate is guilty of an offense against the ordinances of this city if the public servant negligently permits an escape.
Reference: NDCC Sec. 12.1-08-07 (1985)
6-02-04. Criminal Contempt.

Title 6 5
b. Misbehavior of any of its officers in their official transactions.
c. Disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree or command.
2. Except as otherwise provided, a criminal contempt proceeding under this section is deemed a prosecution for an offense for the purposes of NDCC Chapters 12.1-01 through 12.1-05, NDCC Chapter 12.1-32, and the provisions of this chapter.
3. A criminal contempt proceeding under this section is not a bar to subsequent prosecution for a specific offense if the court certifies in the judgment of conviction of criminal contempt, or the order terminating the proceeding without acquittal or dismissal, that a summary criminal contempt proceeding was necessary to prevent repetition of misbehavior disruptive of an ongoing proceeding and that subsequent prosecution as a specific offense is warranted. In a subsequent prosecution, the defendant shall receive credit for all time spent in custody and any fine paid pursuant to the criminal proceeding.
4. This section shall not be construed to deprive a court of its power, by civil contempt proceedings, to compel compliance with its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command or to compensate a complainant for losses sustained by reason of disobedience or resistance thereto. Disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree or command shall be dealt with according to N.D.C.C. Sec. 40-18-14.
Reference: NDCC Sec. 12.1-10-01 (1985)
6-02-05. Impersonating City Officials.
1. A person is guilty of an offense if that person falsely pretends to be a public servant and acts as if to exercise the authority of that public servant.
2. It is no defense to prosecution under this section that the pretended capacity did not exist or the pretended authority could not legally or otherwise have been exercised or conferred. If the offender "obtains a thing of value" as a result of the pretension or falsely pretends to be a law enforcement officer, the offender is guilty of the greater offense prohibited by NDCC Section 12.1-13-04(1)(b), which is not subject to the jurisdiction of the municipal court.

CHAPTER 7-01. PURCHASE AND SALE OF PROPERTY AND SERVICES
7-01-01. Statement of Policy. It is the intent of this
Title 7 3
chapter to provide for a uniform method for procuring supplies, materials, equipment, and contractual services necessary to carry on activities of the city and to sell or otherwise transfer needed supplies, equipment and other property.
It is the policy of the city to procure supplies, materials, equipment and contractual services in an efficient manner and to assure that the highest quality is obtained at the best price available. When practicable and in the best interests of the city, competitive bids shall be solicited in order to reduce prices.
It is the policy of the city to comply with all laws, rules, regulations and orders with respect to local preference, non-discrimination, wages and hours and all other applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders.
All suppliers, contractors and service providers doing business with the City must certify that they are in compliance with all federal, state and local laws, regulations and orders including but not limited to those regarding non-discrimination, wages and hours, worker’s compensation and immigration. Failure of compliance may result in the cancellation of any City contract and exclusion from consideration for future contracts.
(Ord. 5553, 10-10-06)
7-01-02. Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter, unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires:
1. "Contractual services" means services provided by entities other than the City of Bismarck, other governmental bodies or public utilities.
2. "Emergency" means a situation in which, due to unforeseen circumstances, immediate action or action which cannot or should not be delayed, pending solicitation of bids and purchase of needed supplies or services by competitive bids, is called for.
3. "Non-competitive type or kind" means supplies or services which are by their nature unique and not subject to competition, including professional services, management services, contracts with the manufacturer or seller or service agent for repair of equipment, services or supplies of a specialized nature that are available from only one supplier or a limited number of suppliers who are not in competition with each other, other supplies or services for which the local market is not competitive, or supplies or services for which, in order to obtain the best quality at the lowest price, purchase in the open market is called for.
4. "Supplies" means all supplies, materials and
Title 7 4
equipment.
7-01-03. Competitive Bidding Required.
1. All purchases of and contracts for supplies and contractual services, and all sales of property that has become obsolete or unusable must, except as otherwise provided herein, be based on competitive bids. Unless otherwise directed by the commission, or otherwise provided by law, all bids must be advertised in the local newspaper once each week for two consecutive weeks with the bid opening at least 10 days after the last advertisement.
2. All supplies and contractual services, except as otherwise provided herein, when the estimated cost exceeds $50,000.00, must be purchased at public sale from the lowest and best bid meeting or exceeding specifications pursuant to Section 44-08-01.1, N.D.C.C. and subject to Section 44-08-01, N.D.C.C.
3. All sales or dispositions of obsolete or unusable property, when the estimated value exceeds $3,000.00, may be sold only at public sale except as provided by Section 7-01-05. Sales of property of an estimated value of $3,000.00 or less may be made by private sale.
4. Purchases of supplies and contractual services, when the estimated cost is $10,000.00 or less, may be made in the open market without competitive bidding, unless otherwise required by law. Purchases of supplies and contractual services, when the estimated cost is more than $10,000.00 but less than $50,000.00, may be made in the open market without competitive bids, provided that documentation is submitted showing that prices or informal quotes were solicited from a minimum of three suppliers or, if fewer than three suppliers are available, then from all available suppliers, unless otherwise required by law.
5. Any supplies, materials, equipment, or contractual services previously competitively bid by the State or one of its agencies, for which the State or agency has made provision for participation by political subdivisions, may be purchased through the State or agency's bid letting upon approval by the City Commission.
6. Any supplies, materials, equipment, or contractual services may be purchased through another State’s cooperative purchasing venture or professional Association cooperative purchasing venture, of which the City, or its Department, or an employee, is a member of the Association, upon approval by the City Commission.

Title 7 5
14; Ord. 6405, 02-08-20)
7-01-04. Exceptions.
1. Notwithstanding Section 7-01-03, purchases of supplies or services of a non-competitive type or kind, or purchases from other governmental bodies, or purchases made when, in the opinion of the Board of City Commissioners or its executive officer, an emergency requires immediate purchase of supplies or contractual services, may be made in the open market without competitive bidding.
2. Whenever a purchase or contract for services with an estimated cost that would require competitive bids under Section 7-01-03 is made without competitive bids, a written report or a copy of the memo to the City Commission requesting an exception must be filed with the bill or contract stating the reason why competitive bids were not called for and listing all suppliers contacted and quotes or estimates obtained.
3. For purposes of this section, “emergency” includes the following:
a. For a failure of a City utility facility with an anticipated repair cost of less than $50,000.00, the Director of Public Works (Service or Utility Operations) is authorized to obtain quotes and hire the necessary contractor(s) to repair the damage and re-establish the utility service. Costs for the work must relate closely to the State “Blue Book” costs. If the expected cost of repair is in excess of $50,000 but less than $200,000, the City Administrator must approve the expenditure prior to engaging the contractor(s) to perform the repair work. The City Administrator will notify the mayor and the commissioner holding the portfolio about the incident and the ordered repairs as soon as is practicable. The Director of Public Works and/or the City administrator may not authorize emergency utility repair expenditures in excess of $200,000 for a utility failure.
b. In the case of damage to other City property, emergency repairs are authorized to be made, not to exceed $50,000, by the affected department head to the extent minimally necessary to preserve the value of the damaged City property. The affected department head shall notify the City Administrator of the incident as soon as is practicable.
7-01-05. Conveyance Sale, Lease or Disposal of Real or Personal Property.
Title 7 6
1. Personal property valued at less than $3,000.00 that has been determined obsolete and is no longer used by the city may be sold at private sale. The department head of the department selling the obsolete property shall make a record of the sale containing a description of the obsolete property, the reason it is no longer used, the date of sale, the purchase price, and the party to whom the obsolete property was sold. Purchases of obsolete property owned by the city may not be made by city employees or their agents except at public sale. Such sales must be reported to the Board of City Commissioners.
Real or personal property valued at more than $3,000.00 belonging to the municipality may be conveyed, sold or disposed of only as approved by a majority vote of all members of the governing body. The governing body shall determine whether property with an estimated value of more than $3,000.00 shall be sold at public or at private sale. Property valued over $10,000.00 may be sold only at public sale, or as provided under paragraph 2 of this section, or as provided under section 7-01-07. When a public sale is required or authorized a notice containing a description of the property to be sold and designating the place where and the day and hour when the sale will be held must be published in the official newspaper once each week for two consecutive weeks with the last publication being at least ten days in advance of the date set for the sale. The notice shall specify whether the bids are to be received at auction or as sealed bids as determined by the governing body of the municipality. The property advertised must be sold to the highest bidder if the bid is deemed sufficient by a majority of the governing body, unless all bids are rejected.
2. Used motor vehicles which are determined by the department head and fleet services to be obsolete or un-needed for departmental operations and are available for other city operations shall first be offered to other city departments. If no other city department acquires the motor vehicle or if the motor vehicle is not appropriate for other city use, the department owning the motor vehicle may publicly list the motor vehicle as for sale in a classified ad or another public market place commonly used for the sale of motor vehicles. A department wishing to sell a motor vehicle valued at more than $3,000 must first obtain the permission of the governing body before publicly listing the motor vehicle. City employees or their agents may not purchase motor vehicles owned by the city and sold through a public listing. Motor vehicles forfeited to the Police Department shall be incorporated into the Police Department fleet or sold at public sale as described in paragraph 1 of this section.
Title 7 7
3. When specific statutory provisions contained in the North Dakota Century Code provide for a procedure governing the conveyance, sale, lease or disposal of real property, those procedures shall apply unless modified by this section. Said statutory procedures include, but are not limited to:
a. Lease of airports or landing fields, or portions thereof under authority granted in Chapter 2-02, N.D.C.C. Leases must be in compliance with regulations and directives of appropriate federal agencies.

7-01-07. Transfer of Real Property By Nonexclusive Listing Agreements. As an alternative to the procedure established under section 7-01-05, the board of city commissioners may engage licensed real estate brokers to attempt to sell the described property by way of nonexclusive listing agreements that describe the real property of the city which is to be sold; provide a maximum rate of fee, compensation or commission; and provide that the city reserves the right to reject any and all offers determined to be insufficient. As a further alternative to the procedure established under section 7-1-05, the city may create and maintain a list of all city real property that is for sale. The real property list must be on file and available in the office of City Administration. Any city owned real property contained on the real property list for at least 90 days may be sold by negotiated sale approved by the board of city commissioners.

Provisional appointments may be made for a term of no longer than three months.

An employee shall retain probationary status until the appointing authority shall certify on a prescribed form to the personnel director, at the end of the probationary period, that the employee be retained and placed in the civil service.

c. Encourage employees to evaluate their own performance, in terms of specific or general problems, work unit and individual objectives, and career goals and interests.
d. Provide meaningful data to administrators in making key personnel management decisions such as
TITLE 9 17
salary increases, transfers, promotions, layoffs and disciplinary actions.
e. Assist supervisors in recognizing employee capabilities, potential, interests and goals.
f. Provide supervisors with an opportunity to sense causes of and problems in job satisfaction and morale among employees individually or as a group.
Through proper use of this performance appraisal system, an increased and meaningful exchange of thoughts and ideas can occur between employees and supervisors.
2. The appraiser. Each employee covered by this system will be appraised by that person in the best position to do so. Normally, the appraiser will be the employee's immediate supervisor who has the responsibility for assigning, directing and reviewing the work of the employee. If, because of rotational assignments or other reasons, it is not clear to whom an employee reports, a decision will be made as to whom is best able to appraise the employee based on actual observation. An employee's peers may also be utilized in the appraisal process.
3. Who is appraised. All regular full-time and regular part-time employees will be appraised.
4. Probationary appraisal. An appraisal of performance will be made every three months prior to the conclusion of the probationary period. The appraiser will be geared to helping the new employee, and will allow sufficient time before the end of probationary period for the appraiser to note improvements in performance. A final appraisal at the end of the probationary period will be made to provide the basis for retention or termination of the employee.
5. Frequency of appraisal. Appraisals will be completed once a year for all regular full-time and regular part-time employees who have completed the probationary period. An appointing authority may order additional appraisals at appropriate intervals to address substandard performance or as a part of progressive discipline or any disciplinary action.
6. Appraisal follow-up. A periodic informal discussion between the supervisor and the employee will be part of the formal appraisal system. This discussion will focus on progress the employee has made in improving performance in weak areas, where job assignments can be changed to better meet employee goals, progress made in
TITLE 9 18
meeting work objectives, and other areas of interest or concern.
7. The appraisal form. A separate appraisal form will be completed for each employee. Every supervisor or appraiser should be thoroughly familiar with the form, how to use it and what its purposes are. A "performance appraisal guide" shall be prepared and available for this purpose. It is important to the validity of the system that supervisors be:
a. As objective as possible in completing appraisal forms, and
b. Realistic in determining performance levels for individual performance.
8. Signatures. The employee and the appraiser will sign and date the form after they have together discussed the appraisal form and made written comments.
9. Higher level review. After completion of the performance appraisal discussion between the appraiser and employee, there will be at least one further review of the completed performance appraisal form at a higher level of supervision or management, unless the appraiser is a department head or city commissioner.
10. Distribution of the employee appraisal form. After all levels of review have taken place, the employee will receive a copy of his or her appraisal, a copy will be retained internally within the department and a copy will be placed in the employee's personnel file.

9-03-22. Employee Assistance Program.
1. Statement of policy:
a. The city has a vital concern for its employees' personal problems when those problems impair an employee's ability to perform satisfactorily in his or her job. These may be problems such as alcohol abuse, drug abuse, or other behavior/medical disorders which either endanger fellow employees, or result in poor interpersonal relations, excessive absenteeism, and/or deteriorating work performance.
b. The purpose of this policy is to assist employees with disabling personal problems, in finding help and assuring that the employee will receive the same careful consideration and assistance that is presently extended to city employees who become ill or disabled.
TITLE 9 19
c. It is expected that a city-wide program will enlighten employees that the social stigma of alcohol and other drug dependence is without foundation and that these conditions are treatable as are most other disorders.
d. The city's concern with alcohol and other drug abuse or dependency is strictly limited to its effects on the employee's performance on the job. Whether an employee chooses to drink or not drink socially is the individual's concern.
e. For the purpose of this policy, alcoholism and other drug dependency is defined as an illness in which an employee's consumption of alcoholic beverage or drugs definitely and repeatedly interferes with his or her job performance and/or health.
2. Procedures:
a. It is the responsibility of all supervisors of all departments of the city to implement this policy, and to follow procedures which assure that no employee with an alcohol or drug dependency will have his or her job security or promotional opportunities jeopardized by referral or request for consultation and/or treatment. (An employee who complies with a request for consultation, submits to an evaluation, and satisfactorily completes treatment as indicated, may not be suspended, demoted or terminated, or have his or her job security or promotional opportunities jeopardized by such referral, evaluation or by any absence from work necessary for treatment.)
b. It is recognized that supervisors do not have the professional qualifications to permit judgment as to whether or not an employee has alcohol or other drug dependency. Referral to Human Resources for consultations and subsequent offer of assistance will be based upon unsatisfactory work performance resulting from an apparent medical or behavioral problem, regardless of its nature.
c. An employee must report to Human Resources for consultation when directed to do so by a supervisor or appointing authority.
d. An employee's continued refusal to report for consultation and/or refusal of assistance or refusal to submit to an evaluation and/or treatment if
TITLE 9 20
indicated will be dealt with in accord with section 9-06-02.
e. It is expected that through this policy, employees who suspect that they may have a medical, alcohol, or drug-related problem, even in its early stages, will be encouraged to voluntarily seek consultation and, when indicated, follow through with prescribed treatment.
f. The confidential nature of medical records of employees with alcohol or drug-related problems will be preserved to assure privacy in the same manner as all other medical records.
g. Implementation of this policy will not require, or result in, any special social regulations, privileges, or exemptions from the standard administrative practices applicable to job performance requirements, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
3. Applicability. The program and policies contained in this section apply to all full-time employees of the City.
4. Employee Assistance Program.
a. General statement:
City of Bismarck recognizes that some employees may experience a wide range of personal problems that may adversely affect their job performance. It is also recognized that most personal problems can be dealt with successfully when identified early and referred for appropriate care. The purpose of the Employee Assistance Program is to provide these services leading to appropriate care.
The Employee Assistance Program is designed to deal with a broad spectrum of human problems, such as personal problems, interpersonal problems, financial concerns, problems with addiction, parent/child conflict, marital problems, and other concerns. Most employees may overcome personal problems without professional assistance, but at times professional counseling and/or referral to appropriate community agencies may be beneficial. The Program provides problem assessment and short-term counseling, not to exceed five sessions, and referral to community resources when deemed appropriate.
TITLE 9 21
The cost for assessment, short-term counseling, and referral is covered by City of Bismarck. If costs are incurred for other services that are not covered by City of Bismarck or other benefits, those costs will be the responsibility of the employee.
Employees will be given prompt, careful, confidential consideration.
b. Below are the guidelines for utilizing the Employee Assistance Program:
1) City of Bismarck is concerned with an employee's personal problem when the problem adversely affects job performance.
2) The Employee Assistance Program extends to each employee, regardless of job title or responsibility.
3) Since problems at home can affect job performance, the Employee Assistance Program is also available to each employee's immediate family on a self-referral basis. If an employee or immediate family member has personal problems that may benefit from assistance, the employee or immediate family member is encouraged to use the program. Immediate family is defined as spouse and/or children living in the same household as the employee. Dependent children living outside the home, i.e. college students, will be considered eligible for EAP services. Children under age 18 will be provided an initial assessment by phone, however, will be required to have parental permission to receive EAP services beyond the initial phone contact.
4) Should a performance problem occur at work, employees may be encouraged to seek assistance to determine if personal problems are causing unsatisfactory job performance. Supervisors will not be able to insist that the employee seek Employee Assistance Program assistance. If performance problems are corrected, no further action will be taken. If performance problems persist, the employee will be subject to the normal progressive discipline procedures.
5) All employees are responsible for using this program, when appropriate, to assist in resolving job performance deficiencies related to
TITLE 9 22
personal problems. Supervisors and administrative representatives have been given a comprehensive orientation session. The session identified the goals and objectives of the Employee Assistance Program. Also, the mechanism for referring employees for services through the Employee Assistance Program was explained. Employees received a general orientation session to provide information regarding the Assistance Program. This information provides an overview of what services are available and how to make use of those services. New employees will receive information about the Employee Assistance Program at the time of their initial orientation provided by Human Resources. Quarterly representatives from the provider will be available to provide a group orientation for all new employees if so requested by Human Resources. Annual supervisory sessions will also be made available for any new supervisory staff.
6) When an employee voluntarily comes for assistance, no contact is made with the supervisor. When the employee comes for services at the request or referral of a supervisor, there will be a follow-up contact with the referring supervisor which will discuss whether the employee came for the appointment and whether the employee is following general recommendations relating to treatment/follow-up services.
7) Participation in the program will not jeopardize an employee's job security or promotional opportunities.
All records and discussions of the personal problem will be handled in a confidential manner. These records will be considered as EAP records and will be maintained by the EAP. Records maintained by the EAP are not part of the providers regular medical record. They will not be released without the expressed, written consent of the employee. These records will not become a part of the employee personnel file.
8) Employees and members of their immediate families will receive an assessment and up to four additional counseling sessions for further assessment, evaluation, or treatment of that problem. During the contract period, employees and members of their immediate families may experience multiple problems for which
TITLE 9 23
assessment, evaluation or treatment by the program may be appropriate. Under the provisions of this program, an eligible employee and/or member of his/her immediate family would receive additional services from the program providing the new problem is not related to a situation for which services have already been received. The employee and/or family member will receive an assessment of their new problem and up to four additional assessments.
Depending on the type of problem experienced, a referral to a community agency or resource may be the most appropriate service provided.
9) Where necessary, leave will be granted in accordance with established procedure. If a supervisor refers an individual based on performance concerns or an employee requests of the supervisor to be referred, sick leave will be granted.
10) The employee may request that his/her supervisor attend counseling sessions with the employee.
c. This program and the policies contained herein shall be implemented under a city-wide program under the administration of Human Resources which shall:
1) Enlist the active cooperation and participation of the city health officer and all supervisory personnel in the implementation of the program.
2) Train supervisory personnel in documentation and referral procedures as set forth in this program on the basis of deteriorating work performance.
3) Receive and evaluate (with the aid and counsel of the city health officer) those cases referred by supervisory personnel.
4) Refer those cases which indicate a need for professional evaluation and/or treatment to the appropriate community service agencies both public and private, for evaluation and/or treatment.
TITLE 9 24
5) Oversee the implementation of the provisions of this program with supervisory personnel in order to assure (a) the referral of employees with deteriorating work performance and (b) that referred individuals follow through with prescribed treatment.
6) Report progress of referred cases to the appropriate appointing authority.
7) Issue further directives and instructions as are required, consistent with the policies enunciated in this section.
8) Supervisory personnel shall cooperate and actively participate in this program by documenting and referring cases of deteriorating work performance of employees under their supervision.
9) All evaluations ordered by an appointing authority or Human Resources shall be at no cost to the employee.
(Ord. 4126, 2-10-87; Ord. 4382, 07-02-91)
9-03-23. Sexual Harassment. The City of Bismarck will not tolerate sexual harassment in the work place by any of its employees. The city shall adopt a policy regarding sexual harassment and that policy will be available upon request from the human resources department. Any person aggrieved by any conduct of a City of Bismarck employee that is alleged to be sexual harassment and a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or NDCC Chapter 14-02.4 may file a grievance pursuant to City Ordinance 9-06-06(1), if the grievant is a city employee and 9-06-06(2), if the grievant is a non-city employee.

4. An employee may at any time request in writing to the civil service commission a review of the allocation of his or her position. Such request shall give the employee's reason for review, and the civil service commission may in its own discretion proceed to investigate the position. The decision of the civil service commission based on such investigation as to the correctness of the allocation shall be final.
9-04-03. Age Limits. The class specification for positions in the civil service may contain age limits as the civil service commission may determine, provided such limits are consistent with federal and state laws and regulations.
9-04-04. Development and Implementation of Salary Plan.

The salary plan must be comprised of salary ranges showing minimum and maximum rates for each class of position.
2. Following approval of the salary plan by the civil service commission, the personnel director shall submit the plan to the board of city commissioners for its approval.
3. Upon approval by the board of city commissioners, the plan shall constitute the official salary plan for the civil service of the city, and no base salary in excess of the maximum rate or less than the minimum rate established for a class or position may be paid to any employee holding a position in that class.
9-04-05. Certification of Payrolls. The personnel director shall audit the payment of salaries of persons in the civil service for compliance with the salary plan.

A copy of the notice of suspension, demotion or dismissal must be immediately filed with the personnel director. The notice shall state that the employee has a right to an informal hearing with the personnel director, the appointing authority and the employee and/or employee's representative, and an opportunity to be heard at that hearing prior to termination upon request. Following the hearing, if requested, the proposed action may be affirmed, modified or withdrawn.
9-06-04. Appeal.
1. Within five business days after the effective date of suspension, demotion or termination and receipt of written notice of suspension, demotion or termination, issued pursuant to section 9-06-03, or written response to a grievance made pursuant to section 9-06-06(1), any official or employee affected may appeal in writing to the civil service commission for a hearing. The written notice or written response shall contain a statement advising the employee of the right to a hearing upon request made within five days.
2. The commission, upon receiving notice of appeal, shall set a date for a hearing, which may not be less than
TITLE 9 34
seven nor more than sixty days after the date of the filing of the notice of appeal, unless otherwise ordered by the commission. Notice of the time and place of the hearing must be served upon the appealing official or employee or his/her legal counsel and upon the authority imposing the suspension, demotion, termination, or other action complained of, personally or by certified mail or to legal counsel by regular mail with an affidavit of service at least five business days before the date of the hearing.
3. The commission shall hear the appeal at the time set by it. The commission may hear the evidence and facts to be presented by the appealing official or employee and the authority imposing the suspension, demotion or dismissal, or other action complained of in any order it deems appropriate so long as all parties are given a full opportunity to be heard. The evidence of the parties may be through sworn testimony of witnesses or through exhibits introduced through sworn witnesses. After all parties have presented their evidence and have been given a full opportunity to be heard, the commission may call other persons or witnesses to ascertain the on which it deems proper.
4. After having completed the hearing and any investigation which it has chosen to undertake, the commission shall decide the appeal on its merits. The commission can fully uphold the discipline imposed upon the appealing official or employee. The commission can find that there was no just cause for the imposition of the discipline and it can reinstate the employee to the status held immediately prior to the discipline and restore to the employee any pay lost as a result. The commission can also find that it was proper to discipline the employee or official, but that the level of discipline imposed did not fit the offense committed. It may therefore impose upon the employee or official some lesser form of discipline. Or, the commission can issue its findings and an appropriate order with respect to an appeal of a grievance filed pursuant to section 9-06-06(1). In all cases the commission shall issue its written findings, conclusions and order within five days of the hearing. A hearing may be continued from time to time by the commission.
5. The commission shall also hear appeals under the procedures set forth above from any employee or official aggrieved as a result of disciplinary action or from any employee or official who alleges discrimination due to race, color, creed, sex, age, marital status, national origin, or physical disability or other grievance relating to employment laws, rules, regulations or ordinances, or any other grievance relating to personnel matters.
TITLE 9 35
6. A decision of the commission is final.

9-06-05. Compulsory Retirement. An appointing authority may dismiss or involuntarily retire a full-time employee who is physically or mentally unable to perform the duties of the employee's position. The appointing authority may direct any employee to submit to an examination of the city health officer and two other physicians named by the personnel director for the purpose of determining if the employee is physically or mentally unable to perform the duties of the employee's position. Refusal to be examined shall be deemed grounds for suspension, demotion or dismissal. Upon the concurring report of at least two physicians that the employee is physically or mentally unable to perform his or her duties, the employee may dismissed or involuntarily retired. The employee may appeal the action pursuant to section 9-06-04.
(Ord. 4114, Sec. 1, 12-02-86)

CHAPTER 9-07. CITY EMPLOYEE PENSION PLAN
9-07-01. Assessments; Pick-up Provision. Each full-time employee of the city who is a participant in the city employee pension plan pursuant to section 9-07-11 shall be assessed and required to pay monthly an amount of five percent upon the amount of the basic salary that would be paid to the employee but for this provision, which shall be deducted and retained out of such salary.
The amount of assessment provided under this section 9-07-01 shall be applied by a payroll reduction agreement to be remitted through an executed trust agreement or contract with an insurance company in such a manner so far as practicable as to be exempt from any federal or state income taxes on the assessment or on investment income until an act of constructive receipt of these funds occurs.
Although these assessments may be designated as employee contributions, they are deemed to have been paid to the city employee's pension fund by the city in lieu of contributions by the employee; and the employee has no option to receive the contributed amounts directly.
(Ord. 5153, 01-08-02)
TITLE 9 39
9-07-02. Board of Trustees and Duties.

At the end of each fiscal year, the board of trustees may invest any surplus left in the city employee’s pension fund, but no part of the moneys realized from any tax levy shall be used for any purpose other than the payment of pensions. Surplus funds may be invested in:
a. interest-bearing bonds of the United States or the state, or bonds or warrants of any county, township or municipal corporation of this state which constitute the general obligations or contingent general obligations of the issuing tax authority;
b. investments with any federally-insured bank or savings and loan association; or
c. other investments by selecting a funding agent or agents and establishing an investment agreement contract regarding surplus funds.

All securities, in which moneys belonging to the fund are invested, shall be deposited with the treasurer of the board for safekeeping.
In no event shall any part of the city employees’ pension fund be paid to or become vested in the city, or be used for any purpose whatsoever other than for the exclusive benefit of contributing members, former contributing members and their beneficiaries, except as provided in section 9-07-21 and section 9-07-22 of this chapter, except that contributions of the city may be returned if:
TITLE 9 40
1. The contribution was conditioned on the qualification of the plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a), the plan does not so qualify and the contribution is returned within one year after the plan is found to not so qualify; or
2. The contribution was made due to a mistake of fact, the contribution is returned within one year of the mistaken payment of the contribution and the return satisfied the requirements of the last paragraph of this section.
The return of a contribution (or portion of a contribution) to the city satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the amount so returned (a) does not exceed the excess of the contribution over the amount which could have been contributed had there been no mistake of fact, (b) does not include the net earnings attributable to such excess contributions, and (c) is reduced by any net losses attributable to the excess contribution.
(Ord. 5041, 04-11-00; Ord. 5153, 01-08-02)
9-07-04. Gifts, Devises or Bequests. The board may take by gift, devise or bequest any money or property, real or personal, or other thing of value for the benefit of the fund. All rewards in moneys, fees, gifts or emoluments of any kind or nature that may be paid or given to the city or to any employee, except when allowed to be retained or given for endowing a medal or other permanent or competitive reward on account of extraordinary services rendered by the city or any employee shall be paid into the pension fund.

The salary received by any person so employed plus the pension received under the terms and provisions of this chapter 9-07, Chapter 9-08 or the Bismarck Fire Fighters Relief Association pension plan shall not exceed the regular pay for the position from which the employee has retired. All part-time positions must be filled pursuant to chapter 9-03.

9-07-09. Contribution of City. The board of city commissioners shall annually levy a tax as may be needed to maintain the pension fund in a sound actuarial condition, the proceeds of which shall be placed in the pension fund. The levy shall be in addition to any other levies authorized by law for a general purpose; provided, however, that when there is a sufficient balance in the fund to meet any proper or legitimate charges that may be made against it, the city shall not be required to levy a tax for this purpose.
(Ord. 5153, 01-08-02)
9-07-10. Actuary. The pension and retirement system shall be based upon actuarial tables and the board of trustees shall, from time to time, be empowered to engage the services of an actuary for the purpose of determining the condition of the fund. The actuary shall be paid by check issued by the board of trustees in a reasonable amount determined by the board of trustees.
In calculating the actuarial equivalence of one form of benefit to another, the interest rate to be used shall be 7% and
TITLE 9 42
the mortality table to be used shall be the “applicable mortality table”, defined as the mortality table based upon the Internal Revenue Service Commissioner's standard table used to determine reserves for group annuity contracts issued on the date as of which present value is determined, as published by the Department of the Treasury for purposes of Section 417(e)(3) of the Code.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective January 1, 2000, for the purpose of determining the lump sum value of a participant's benefit, the interest rate shall be the “applicable interest rate”, defined as the annual interest rate on 30-year United States Treasury Securities as published by the Department of the Treasury and Federal Reserve as in effect for the second month (the “look-back month”) preceding the first day of the “stability period.” The “stability period” shall be the plan year.

TITLE 9 43
all the provisions of this chapter governing the operation of the fund and the requirements as to members and payments to beneficiaries.

The employee's entire interest shall be the sum of all an employee's contributions made under Section 9-07-01 plus interest earnings at two and one-half percent (2.5%) per annum on contributions made through 1972 and plus interest earnings at five percent (5%) per annum on all employee contributions thereafter. No rights to pension benefits shall accrue to an employee or to the employee's beneficiary during any leave of absence, except that this clause shall not be construed to deprive any employee of pension benefits accrued during a regular annual leave or sick leave or absence duly granted, as provided by this chapter, nor to an employee referred to in section 9-07-05.

(Ord. 4944, 09-22-98; Ord. 5153, 01-08-02; Ord. 5376, 12-28-04; Ord. 5572, 03-13-07)
9-07-15. Pension Eligibility; Computations; Required Distributions. Every employee of the city who is a participant in the city employee pension plan pursuant to section 9-07-11 or the surviving spouse of any such employee who is deceased, provided said participant or said surviving spouse has made application to the board of trustees and been certified by the board of trustees as entitled to a pension, shall be paid out of the city employees’ pension fund an amount determined in accordance with the following:
TITLE 9 44
1. Any contributing member who has served in active employment until the age of sixty-two shall be eligible for a monthly pension benefit computed by multiplying the member’s highest thirty-six (36) months (or total months of employment, if less) of average basic monthly compensation times one and three-quarters percent (1.75%) and then multiplying the resultant product by the member’s number of full and fractional years of recognized service as defined in section 9-07-23. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any member who terminated employment or retired from the city prior to January 1, 2002, the phrase "highest thirty-six (36) months" in the foregoing sentence shall be replaced with "highest sixty (60) months." In computing benefits accruing on and after January 1, 2005, "one and three-quarters percent (1.75%)" in the foregoing sentence shall be replaced with "two and one-quarter percent (2.25%).
On or after January 1, 2005, a participant may elect to apply the two and one-quarter percent multiplier to all or any portion of the participant’s recognized service prior to January 1, 2005. The additional cost to the pension fund of applying the higher multiplier to such prior recognized service, as determined by the plan’s actuary, shall be borne by the participant. The participant may elect one or more of following options to fund said additional cost:
(a) The participant may make an irrevocable election to contribute to the plan, on a pre-tax basis, compensation not yet earned. The election shall specify an amount to be deducted and retained from the participant’s salary each month, for payment to the pension fund, until said additional cost has been funded. Such contributions shall be deemed to have been paid to the plan by the city in lieu of contributions by the employee and the employee shall have no option to receive the contributed amounts directly.
(b) The participant may make an irrevocable election to contribute all or any portion of any payout for sick, vacation or other paid time off accrued but not taken up to the day prior to the date of the election, to fund said additional cost. Such a contribution shall be deemed to have been paid to the plan by the city in lieu of contributions by the employee and the employee shall have no option to receive the contributed amounts directly.
TITLE 9 45
(c) The participant may make an election to transfer all or any portion of the participant’s excess account, as described in paragraph 4 of section 9-07-22, to fund said additional cost.
The City intends that the foregoing provisions shall be applied and interpreted consistent with applicable law. Any election made pursuant to the foregoing provisions shall be effective only to the extent consistent with applicable law, this ordinance and any rules and procedures adopted by the City. Participants making any election under this section shall do so in compliance with any rules and procedures adopted by the City and any limits imposed by other sections of this ordinance or applicable law.
Effective for benefits accruing after December 31, 1988, the annual compensation of each employee taken into account under the plan shall not exceed $200,000 ($150,000 for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1996), as adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for cost of living adjustments. For fiscal years prior to January 1, 1997, in determining the compensation of an employee, the rules of Internal Revenue Code Section 414(9)(6) shall apply, except that the term “family” shall include only the spouse of the employee and any lineal descendants of the employee who have not attained age 19 before the close of the plan year.
2. Any contributing member who has served at least sixty (60) months of contributing service, whether or not consecutive, in the employment of the city, shall be entitled to retirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any member who terminated employment or retired from the city prior to January 1, 2002, the phrase "sixty (60) months of contributing service" in the foregoing sentence shall be replaced with "one hundred twenty (120) months of contributing service." Such member’s retirement benefit shall be equal to the member’s accrued normal retirement benefit as determined under the preceding subsection 1 of this section 9-07-15 multiplied by the actuarial equivalent factor set forth below, interpolated to the nearest monthly age at the date upon which the pension benefits commence.

3. Any contributing member who has served at least sixty (60) months of contributing service, whether or not consecutive, in the employment of the city and who terminates employment with the city, may elect a deferred retirement benefit to commence at the elected age from age fifty to age sixty-two. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any member who terminated employment or retired from the city prior to January 1, 2002, the phrase "sixty (60) months of contributing service" in the foregoing sentence shall be replaced with "one hundred twenty (120) months of contributing service." The deferred benefit shall be equal to the member's accrued normal retirement benefit as determined in subsection 1 of this section 9-07-15, (based upon service and compensation to the date of employment termination) multiplied by the actuarial, equivalent factor set forth in subsection 2 of this section 9-07-15, determined on the basis of the age elected for deferred benefits to commence hereunder.
4. To the surviving spouse as long as he or she remains unmarried, a sum equal to two-thirds of the pension to which the employee would have been entitled under the provisions of sections 9-07-15(l)-(3), 9-07-16 and 9-07-17, not less, however, than $65.00 per month, provided the employee served at least sixty (60) months of contributing service, whether or not consecutive, in the employment of the city. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any member who died prior to January 1, 2002, the phrase "sixty (60) months of contributing service" in the foregoing sentence shall be replaced with "one hundred twenty (120) months of contributing service." A spouse shall be considered to be a surviving spouse only if the spouse was married to the employee when the employee separated from service, or, if such separation occurred prior to the plan’s effective date, the spouse was also married to the employee on the effective date of the plan.
5. A surviving spouse has the option to withdraw all of the employee's entire interest as defined in Section 9-07-14. A surviving spouse who elects to withdraw an employee's entire interest does so in lieu of all benefits outlined in subsection 4 of this section 9-07-15.
6. If there is no surviving spouse, then the employee's entire interest, as defined in Section 9-07-14, will be paid to the employee’s estate.
TITLE 9 47
7. Distribution Upon Death.
(a) Death After Commencement of Benefits. If distribution of an employee’s interest has begun in accordance with subsection 1, 2, or 3 of this section 9-07-15, and the employee dies before his or her entire interest has been distributed to him or her, then the remaining portion of such interest shall be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of his or her death.
(b) Death Before Commencement of Benefits. If an employee dies before distribution of the employee’s interest has begun, the entire interest of the employee shall be distributed no later than December 31 of the calendar year which contains the fifth anniversary of the date of the employee's death. This five-year distribution rule shall not apply if (1) any portion of the employee's interest (or of the deceased spouse of such employee, as provided below) is payable to or for the benefit of a designated beneficiary, as determined pursuant to Proposed Treasury regulations § 1.401(a) (9)-1 (or any successor regulation); (2) this portion will be distributed over the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary), and (3) the distributions commence no later than December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the employee died. If the surviving spouse is the beneficiary and dies before payments are deemed to have begun, the five-year distribution rule and the exception to it stated in this paragraph are to be applied as if the surviving spouse were the employee and the spouse's date of death shall be substituted for the employee's date of death.
This five-year distribution rule shall also not apply if: (1) the portion of the employee's interest to which the surviving spouse is entitled will be distributed over the life of the surviving spouse (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the surviving spouse, which may be recalculated not more frequently than annually); and (2) the distributions commence on or before the later of December 31 of the calendar year in which the employee would have attained age 70½ or December 31 of the calendar immediately following the calendar year in which the employee died.
TITLE 9 48
(c) Designated Beneficiary. For purposes of this section, the term "designated beneficiary" means any individual designated as a beneficiary by the employee.
8. Required Distributions. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary, the following provisions shall control:
(a) General Rule. The entire interest of each employee shall be distributed to such employee not later than the required beginning date (as defined below), or will be distributed, beginning not later than the required beginning date, in accordance with regulations, over the life of such employee or over the lives of such employee and a designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such employee or the life expectancy of such employee and a designated beneficiary).
(b) Required Beginning Date. For purposes of this section, the term "required beginning date" means April 1st of the calendar year following the later of (i) the calendar year in which the employee attains age 70 1/2; or (ii) the calendar year in which the employee retires.
(c) Designated Beneficiary. For purposes of this section, the term "designated beneficiary" means any individual designated as a beneficiary by the employee.
(d) Continued Service Beyond Age 62. An employee may at his or her request be continued in employment beyond age 62. In such event, no retirement benefit will be paid to such employee until he or she actually retires, subject, however, to any required minimum distributions pursuant to this section 9-07-15. Such an employee shall continue to accrue credit for years of service after attainment of age 62, and changes in average basic monthly compensation shall also be taken into account.
(e) With respect to distributions under the city employee pension plan made for calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, the plan will apply the minimum distribution requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code in accordance with the regulations under section 401(a)(9) that were proposed on January 17, 2001, notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary. This amendment
TITLE 9 49
shall continue in effect until the end of the last calendar year beginning before the effective date of final regulations under section 401(a)(9) or such other date as may be specified in guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service.
(Ord. 4299, 10-17-89; Ord. 5041, 04-11-00; Ord. 5153, 01-08-02; Ord. 5376, 12-28-04)
9-07-16. Cost of Living Adjustment Procedure. Persons receiving pension payments under the provisions of this chapter shall be eligible for cost of living adjustments in an amount determined by the board of trustees. The adjustment, if any, will be effective at the same time as the city employees’ salary adjustment made in the same year. The adjustment may not exceed the lesser of:
1. The city employees' adjustments; or
2. 3%.
Cost of living adjustments shall be made in respect to pensioners and surviving spouses who are receiving pension benefits at the time the cost of living adjustments are made.
(Ord. 4878, 12-09-97; Ord. 5041, 04-11-00; Ord. 5153, 01-08-02)
9-07-17. Optional Settlements and Life Annuity Limitations. Any optional settlements under this plan shall be limited to the life expectancy of the participating member or the surviving spouse of the participating member. In no event is an "interest only" option permissible whereunder the total payout would extend beyond the life expectancy of the member and the member’s spouse. The following restrictions and limitations shall apply to benefit payments.
1. Benefit Limited to Maximum Permissible Benefit. The Annual Benefit otherwise payable to a member at any time shall not exceed the Maximum Permissible Benefit. If the benefit the member would otherwise accrue in a Limitation Year would produce an Annual Benefit in excess of the Maximum Permissible Benefit, the rate of accrual shall be limited, or the rate of accrual reduced, to a benefit that does not exceed the Maximum Permissible Benefit.
2. Adjustment if in Two or More Defined Benefit Plans. If the member is, or has ever been, a member of another qualified defined benefit plan (without regard to whether the plan has been terminated) maintained by the city, the sum of the member’s Annual Benefits from all such plans may not exceed the Maximum Permissible Benefit. Where the member’s employer-provided benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the Maximum Permissible Benefit applicable at
TITLE 9 50
that age, the city shall limit a member’s benefit in accordance with the terms of the plans.
3. Definitions. For purposes of this Section 9-07-17, the following terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below, unless expressly provided for herein, and when the defined meaning is intended, the term is capitalized.
a. “Annual Benefit” means a benefit that is payable annually in the form of a Straight Life Annuity. Except as provided below, where a benefit is payable in a Straight Life Annuity, the benefit shall be adjusted to an actuarially equivalent Straight Life Annuity that begins at the same time as such other form of benefit and is payable on the first day of each month before applying the limitations of this Section 9-07-17. For a member who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one Annuity Starting Date, the Annual Benefit shall be determined as of each such Annuity Starting Date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this Section 9-07-17 as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other Annuity Starting Dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new Annuity Starting Date has occurred shall be made without regard to Regulations Section 1. 401(b)-20, Q&A 10(d), and with regard to Regulations Section 1.415(b)-1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C).
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for (1) survivor benefits payable to a surviving spouse under a qualified joint and survivor annuity to the extent such benefits would not be payable if the member’s benefit were paid in another form; (2) benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or (3) the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to Code Section 417(e)(3) and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this Section 9-07-17, and the Plan provides that the amount payable under the form of benefit in any Limitation Year shall not exceed the limits of this Section 9-07-17 applicable at the Annuity Starting Date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d). For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the
TITLE 9 51
benefits paid in that form.
The determination of the Annual Benefit shall take into account benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits pursuant Regulations Section 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c), but shall disregard benefits attributable to member contributions or rollover contributions.
Effective for distributions in Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2003, the determination of actuarial equivalence of forms of benefit other than a Straight Life Annuity shall be made in accordance with (i) or (ii) below.
(i) Benefit forms not subject to Code Section 417(e)(3). The Straight Life Annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the member’s form of benefit shall be determined under this subsection (i) if the form of the member’s benefit is either (1) a nondecreasing annuity (other than a Straight Life Annuity) payable for a period of not less than the life of the member (or, in the case of a qualified pre-retirement survivor annuity, the life of the surviving spouse), or (2) an annuity that decreases during the life of the member merely because of (A) the death of the survivor annuitant (but only if the reduction is not below 50% of the benefit payable before the death of the survivor annuitant), or (B) the cessation or reduction of Social Security supplements or qualified disability payments (as defined in Code Section 401(a)(11)).
(1) Limitation Years beginning before July 1, 2007. For Limitation Years beginning before July 1, 2007, the actuarially equivalent Straight Life Annuity is equal to the annual amount of the Straight Life Annuity commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit computed using whichever of the following produces the greater annual amount: (I) the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the Plan for adjusting benefits in the same form; and (II) 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table under Section 417(e)(3) of the Code for the calendar year in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs.
TITLE 9 52
(2) Limitation Years beginning on or after July 1, 2007. For Limitation Years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the actuarially equivalent Straight Life Annuity is equal to the greater of (a) the annual amount of the Straight Life Annuity (if any) payable to the member under the Plan commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date as the member’s form of benefit; and (b) the annual amount of the Straight Life Annuity commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table under Section 417(e)(3) of the Code for the calendar year in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs.
(ii) Benefit Forms Subject to Code Section 417(e)(3). The Straight Life Annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the member’s form of benefit shall be determined under this paragraph if the form of the member’s benefit is other than a benefit form described in subsection 3(a)(i) above. The actuarially equivalent Straight Life Annuity is equal to the greatest of (a) the annual amount of the Straight Life Annuity commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the Plan for adjusting benefits in the same form; (b) the annual amount of the Straight Life Annuity commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using a 5.5 percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table under Section 417(e)(3) of the Code for the calendar year in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs; and (c) the annual amount of the Straight Life Annuity commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using the applicable interest rate and applicable mortality table, both as described in Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, divided by 1.05.
b. “Maximum Permissible Benefit” means, effective for Limitation Years ending after December
TITLE 9 53
31, 2001, $160,000, automatically adjusted under Code Section 415(d), effective January 1 of each year, as published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, and payable in the form of a Straight Life Annuity. The new limitation shall apply to Limitation Years ending with or within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment, but a member’s benefits shall not reflect the adjusted limit prior to January 1 of that calendar year.
(i) Adjustment for Less Than 10 Years of Participation or Service: If the member has less than 10 years of participation in the Plan, the Maximum Permissible Benefit shall be multiplied by a fraction - (i) the numerator of which is the number of Years of Participation in the Plan (or part thereof, but not less than one year), and (ii) the denominator of which is ten (10). In the case of a member who has less than ten Years of Service with the city, the Maximum Permissible Benefit shall be multiplied by a fraction - (i) the numerator of which is the number of Years of Service with the city (or part thereof, but not less than one year), and (ii) the denominator of which is ten (10).
(ii) Adjustment for Benefit Commencement Before Age 62 or after Age 65: Effective for benefits commencing in Limitation Years ending after December 31, 2001, the Maximum Permissible Benefit shall be adjusted if the Annuity Starting Date of the member’s benefit is before age 62 or after age 65.
(iii) Adjustment for Benefit Commencement Before Age 62:
(1) Limitation Years Beginning Before July 1, 2007. If the Annuity Starting Date for the member’s benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning before July 1, 2007, the Maximum Permissible Benefit for the member’s Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a Straight Life Annuity commencing at the member’s Annuity Starting Date that is the actuarial equivalent of the Maximum Permissible benefit (adjusted under subsection (i) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following
TITLE 9 54
produces the smaller annual amount: (a) the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the Plan; or (b) a five-percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table as defined in the Plan.
(2) Limitation Years Beginning on or After July 1, 2007.
(A) Plan Does Not Have Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at both Age 62 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the Annuity Starting Date for the member’s benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan does not have an immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement, the Maximum Permissible Benefit for the member’s Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a Straight Life Annuity commencing at the member’s Annuity Starting Date that is the actuarial equivalent of the Maximum Permissible Benefit (adjusted under subsection(i) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using a five-percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for the Annuity Starting Date as defined in the Plan (and expressing the member’s age based on completed calendar months as of the Annuity Starting Date).
(B) Plan Has Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at both Age 62 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the Annuity Starting Date for the member’s benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan has an immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation for
TITLE 9 55
the member’s Annuity Starting Date is the lesser of the limitation determined under subsection (b)(iii) and the Maximum Permissible benefit (adjusted under subsection (i) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity under the Plan at the member’s Annuity Starting Date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity under the Plan at age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of this Section 9-07-17.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no age adjustment to the Maximum Permissible Benefit shall be required for commencement of benefits before age 62 for any member who is a full-time employee of any police department or fire department that is organized and operated by the city to provide police protection, firefighting services, or emergency medical services for any area within the jurisdiction of the city and with respect to whom the service taken into account in determining the amount of the benefit under the plan includes at least 15 years of service of the member. For purposes of this section, only the classification of the city, not the job classification of the member, is relevant in determining whether this paragraph applies.
(iv) Adjustment of Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation for Benefit Commencement After Age 65:
(1) Limitation Years Beginning Before July 1, 2007. If the Annuity Starting Date for the member’s benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning before July 1, 2007, the Maximum Permissible Benefit for the member’s Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a Straight Life Annuity commencing at the member’s Annuity Starting Date that is the actuarial equivalent of the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation (adjusted under subsection (i)
TITLE 9 56
for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount: (A) the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the Plan; or (B) a five-percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table under Section 417(e)(3) for the calendar year in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs.
(2) Limitation Years Beginning on or After July 1, 2007.
(A) Plan Does Not Have Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at both Age 65 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the annuity starting date for the member’s benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan does not have an immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the Maximum Permissible Benefit at the member’s Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a Straight Life Annuity commencing at the member’s Annuity Starting Date that is the actuarial equivalent of the Maximum Permissible Benefit (adjusted under subsection (i) for years of participation less than 10, if required), with actuarial equivalence computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table under Section 417(e)(3) for the calendar year in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs (and expressing the member’s age based on completed calendar months as of the Annuity Starting Date).
(B) Plan Has Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at both Age 65 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the Annuity Starting Date for the member’s benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a
TITLE 9 57
Limitation Year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the plan has an immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the Maximum Permissible Benefit at the member’s Annuity Starting Date is the lesser of the limitation determined under subsection 3(b)(iv) and the Maximum Permissible Benefit (adjusted under subsection (i) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity under the Plan at the member’s Annuity Starting Date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity under the Plan at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of this Section 9-07-17. For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity under the Plan at the member’s Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the member, computed disregarding the member’s accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity under the Plan at age 65 is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the Plan to a hypothetical member who is age 65 and has the same accrued benefit as the member.
(v) Notwithstanding the other requirements of this section, no adjustment shall be made to the Maximum Permissible Benefit to reflect the probability of a member’s death between the Annuity Starting Date and age 62, or between age 65 and the Annuity Starting Date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member prior to the Annuity Starting Date. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the Annuity Starting Date, such an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the
TITLE 9 58
member’s death if the Plan does not charge members for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, as defined in Code Section 417(c), upon the member’s death.
(vi) Minimum benefit permitted: Notwithstanding anything else in this Section to the contrary, the benefit otherwise accrued or payable to a member under this Plan shall be deemed not to exceed the Maximum Permissible Benefit if:
(1) the retirement benefits payable for a Limitation Year under any form of benefit with respect to such member under this Plan and under all other defined benefit plans (without regard to whether a plan has been terminated) ever maintained by the city do not exceed $10,000 multiplied by a fraction – (a) the numerator of which is the member’s number of Years (or part thereof, but not less than one year) of Service (not to exceed ten (10)) with the city, and (b) the denominator of which is ten (10); and
(2) the city has not at any time maintained a defined contribution plan in which the member participated (for this purpose, mandatory member contributions under a defined benefit plan, individual medical accounts under Code Section 401(h), and accounts for post-retirement medical benefits established under Code Section 419A(d)(1) are not considered a separate defined contribution plan).
c. “Straight Life Annuity” means an annuity payable in equal installments for the life of a member that terminates upon the member’s death.
4. Application of Code Section 415. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, this Section shall be construed in a manner which is consistent with Code Section 415 (which is hereby incorporated herein.) and the rulings and regulations issued there under.
(Ord. 5041, 04-11-00; Ord. 5153, 01-08-02; Ord. 5225, 01-07-03; Ord. 5749, 12-22-09)
9-07-18. Money Drawn; How Paid; Report. All pensions paid and all moneys drawn from the pension fund under the provisions of this chapter shall be upon checks authorized by the board of trustees, and issued by the treasurer of the board, which shall designate the name of the person and purpose for which payment
TITLE 9 59
is made. The treasurer's annual report shall show the receipts and expenditures of the fund for the preceding fiscal year, the money on hand and how invested. The report shall be made to the board of trustees and shall be filed with the clerk of the board.
9-07-19. Reduction of Pension. Whenever the amount realized from the tax levy, assessment upon salary, fees, gifts and grants as provided for, shall be insufficient to meet the demands of the withdrawals due to retirement or disability, the board of trustees shall have the power and authority, in order to safeguard the future of this plan and for the future purpose of ensuring that there shall be no accumulated liability upon the city for unpaid pensions, to make the adjustments and the apportionments of the pensions to be paid as in their judgment will safeguard the pension fund and protect the city from any accumulative liability for pension except such as is provided by the amount of levy authorized by the city employees' pension law. For that purpose and to that end the board of trustees may in their judgment make such reductions and apportionments in the payments of the amount to the employees entitled to a pension or their dependents as is available and increase contributions in a manner to safeguard the future of the pension plan.
9-07-20. Direct Rollovers
1. General Rule. If a “distributee” of any “eligible rollover distribution”:
(a) elects to have such eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an “eligible retirement plan,” and
(b) specifies the eligible retirement plan to which such eligible rollover distribution is to be paid (in such form and at such time as the city may prescribe), such eligible rollover distribution shall be made in the form of a “direct rollover” to the eligible retirement plan so specified by the distributee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this section 9-07-20 shall apply only to the extent the eligible rollover distribution would be includible in gross income if not transferred as provided above.
2. Definitions.
A “direct rollover” is an eligible rollover distribution that is paid directly to an eligible retirement plan for the benefit of the distributee.
“Distributee” means the employee or the surviving spouse of an employee.
TITLE 9 60
An “eligible retirement plan” is an individual retirement account described in Internal Revenue Code Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity (other than an endowment contract) described in Internal Revenue Code Section 408(b), a qualified defined contribution retirement plan that accepts rollover distributions, or an annuity plan described in Internal Revenue Code Section 403(a) that accepts rollover distributions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the distributee is the employee’s surviving spouse, “eligible retirement plan” shall mean either an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity (other than an endowment contract).
For the purposes of the direct rollover provisions in this Section 9-07-20, for distributions made after December 31, 2001, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b) and an eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Code Section 414(p).
“Eligible rollover distribution” means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of an employee in a qualified plan, provided, however, that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:
(a) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments, not less frequently than annually, for the life or life expectancy of the distributee, or for the joint lives or life expectancies of the distributee and his or her spouse or designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of 10 years or more;
(b) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9), relating to minimum distribution requirements; or
TITLE 9 61
(c) the portion of any distribution that is not includible in income.
3. Procedures.
(a) In General. The city may prescribe any procedure for a distributee to elect a direct rollover provided the procedure is reasonable. Such procedure may include any reasonable requirement for information or documentation from the distributee.
(b) Notice and Waiver of Notice Period. At least thirty (30) days and no more than ninety (90) days before making any distribution subject to this section 9-08-19, the city shall provide to the distributee a written explanation of the rules concerning direct rollovers, income tax withheld on distributions not rolled over, and any other information required by Internal Revenue Code Section 402(f) (the “402(f) notice”). Such distribution may commence less than 30 days after the 402(f) notice is given, provided that: (i) the city clearly informs the employee that the employee has a right to a period of at least 30 days after receiving the 402(f) notice to consider the decision of whether or not to elect a distribution (and, if applicable, a particular distribution option), and (ii) the employee, after receiving the 402(f) notice, affirmatively elects a distribution.
(c) $500 Rule. A distributee may elect to have a portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid to an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover and to have the remainder paid to the distributee only if the portion paid to the eligible retirement plan equals at least $500.
(d) Direct Rollover to One Account Only. An eligible rollover distribution (or portion thereof) may be distributed in a direct rollover only to a single eligible retirement plan selected by the distributee.
(e) $200 Rule. A distributee may not elect a direct rollover with respect to eligible rollover distributions during a year if such distributions are reasonably expected to total less than $200.
(f) Method of Making a Direct Rollover. The city may accomplish a direct rollover by any reasonable means of direct payment to an eligible retirement plan including providing a distributee with
TITLE 9 62
a check payable to the eligible retirement plan with instructions to the distributee to deliver the check to the eligible retirement plan.
(g) Default Option. If the distributee does not so elect or does not provide the required information in the form and at the time required by the city, the city shall direct that the distribution be made directly to the distributee and to withhold income taxes on such distribution equal to 20% of the value of such distribution (or such other amount provided under Internal Revenue Code Section 3405(c), as amended). Provided, however, that the city shall not make a distribution under this default option earlier than the date which is 60 days after the distributee is provided with the 402(f) notice. The city shall not withhold tax from an eligible rollover distribution if such distribution is not subject to a direct rollover election because the distribution was not reasonably expected to total $200 in the year.
(h) Periodic Payments. If a distribution subject to this section 9-07-20 is to be paid in a series of periodic payments that are eligible rollover distributions, the following rules shall apply:
(i) a distributee's election to make or not make a direct rollover with respect to a single payment shall control whether a direct rollover is made of all subsequent payments unless the distributee changes the previous election; and
(ii) the city shall provide the 402(f) notice described in the foregoing paragraph at least once annually for as long as the periodic payments continue.
(Ord. 5153, 01-08-02; Ord. 5268, 08-12-03)
9-07-21. Pension Claims Theretofore Allowed. There shall be paid out of the pension fund pension claims theretofore allowed in the same amounts as were in effect on the date discontinuance of the employees' pension plan under Article 2 of Chapter V of the Revised Ordinances of 1966, until the death or disqualification of the pension claimant in the same manner as if the plan had been discontinued.
9-07-22. Variable Annuity; Application of Contributions Thereto.
1. For receipt of any benefits, a member must make application through the city and such benefits will be paid by and controlled by the city. Benefit payments from an executed trust agreement or contract with an insurance
TITLE 9 63
company will be paid to the city for distribution of the eligible recipient.
2. Prior to January 1, 2005, a member may have the option of having his or her contributions invested in fixed income investments or equity variable income investments or any permissible combination. Effective January 1, 2005, members shall have no investment authority with regard to any assets of the plan, including contributions made pursuant to Section 9-07-01 and earnings thereon. The City shall direct the investment of all plan assets.
3. The pension benefits available under section 9-07-15(1)-(3) shall be provided from all plan assets, whether contributed pursuant to Section 9-07-01 or Section 9-07-09 or whether attributable to earnings on such contributions.
4. Effective January 1, 2005, all contributions made prior to January 1, 2005, pursuant to Section 9-07-01 on behalf of an employee plus net investment earnings thereon up to an amount that is equal to said contributions plus interest at five percent per annum accumulated through December 31, 2004, shall be transferred into the control of the City to be used to pay benefits as provided in this chapter and shall no longer be invested at the direction of the employee. If, as of January 1, 2005, said contributions plus net earnings exceeds an amount that is equal to said contributions plus interest at five percent per annum accumulated through December 31, 2004, the excess amount will be determined and will be placed into an account that will continue to be invested at the direction of the employee (hereinafter the “excess amount”). No further contributions made pursuant to Section 9-07-01 or any other provision of this chapter shall be directed into an employee’s excess account or be subject to the investment direction of the employee.
5. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, forfeitures of benefits under this pension retirement system because an employee leaves the employ of the city for any reason shall not be used to increase the pension benefits any member would otherwise receive under the plan at any time prior to termination of the plan or the complete discontinuance of contributions, and any amounts so forfeited shall be used as soon as possible to reduce the city's contributions under the plan.
(Ord. 5041, 04-11-00; Ord. 5153, 01-08-02; Ord. 5376, 12-28-04)
9-07-23. Recognized Service. Recognized service prior to December 28, 1971, shall be based upon recognized service according to the city's record as applicable under the pension ordinances in effect at that time. Recognized service

1. It is hereby expressly provided that upon the partial or complete termination of the city employees' pension system, or upon the complete discontinuance of contributions hereunder, the rights of each employee to benefits accrued to the date of termination or discontinuance, to the extent then funded, or the rights of each employee to the amounts credited to his or her account at the time, shall become nonforfeitable. This requirement shall not apply in respect to benefits for the twenty-five highest paid employees to the extent such benefits may be restricted in the event of early termination in accordance with the requirements of section 9-07-25.
2. It is further provided that any previously unallocated funds shall be allocated to the employees covered by this program in the event of termination or complete discontinuance of contributions under the city employees' pension system.

(a) All employees' total contribution accounts with accumulated income.
(b) All retired participants of beneficiaries receiving payments (reserves in excess of (a) above).
(c) All vested participants (reserves in excess of (a) above).

3. In no event shall the city receive any amounts from the pension fund upon termination of the city employees' pension system, except that, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, the city shall receive such amounts, if any, as may remain after the satisfaction of all liabilities of the plan
TITLE 9 65
and arising out of any variations between actual requirements and expected actuarial requirements.
(Ord. 5153, 01-08-02)
9-07-25. Early Termination.
1. If the plan is terminated or the full current costs are not met within ten years after its establishment or until the full current costs are funded for the first time, the amount of the fund to be used for the benefit of any employee or the beneficiary of any employee who is among the twenty-five highest paid employees of the employer at the time the plan is established, and whose anticipated annual benefit exceeds one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) shall not exceed the larger of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) or twenty percent of the first fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) of his or her annual average compensation multiplied by the number of years between the effective date of this agreement, and
(a) Termination of the plan;
(b) Date the benefit of the employee becomes payable, if before the date of termination of the plan;
(c) Date of the failure to meet the full current costs of the plan;
(d) Any excess reserves arising by application of the foregoing provisions shall be used and applied equitably for the benefit of other employees, retired employees and their beneficiaries and beneficiaries of deceased retired employees on the basis value of the respective portions of the full retirement allowance accrued to the date of the termination of the plan to such employees.
2. If a participant to whom this limitation may be applied leaves the employ of the city or withdraws from participation, prior to his or her normal retirement date, when the full current costs have been met, the benefits which he or she may receive from the employer's contributions shall not at any time, within the first ten years after the effective date, exceed the benefits set forth in paragraph (1).
3. The foregoing conditions shall not restrict the current payment of any retirement allowance called for by the plan to any retired employee or his or her spouse while the plan is in full effect and its full current costs have been met.
(Ord. 5153, 01-08-02)

Effective January 1, 2005, "six percent" in the foregoing sentence shall be replaced with "9.4 percent."
For all calendar years after December 31, 1983, and prior to January 1, 1999:

For all calendar years after December 31, 1998:
1. Although these assessments may be designated as employee contributions, they are being paid to the police department employees’ pension fund by the city in lieu of contributions by the employees; and
2. All full-time police employees have no option to receive the contributed amounts directly, except as provided in section 9-08-14.
(Ord. 4943, 09-22-98; Ord. 5042, 04-11-00; Ord. 5366, 11-09-04; Ord. 5555, 10-24-06)
9-08-02. Board of Trustees and Duties. The chief of police, two members of the police department appointed by the chief of police, each with no less than eight years of service, and two elected members of the police department, each with no less than eight years of service, shall constitute the board of trustees for the management of the police pension plan and the fund created for the same. The appointed and elected trustees shall be chosen by and from employees of the police department who are currently contributing members of the police pension plan. The election for the elected trustees shall be held on the second Tuesday in June of each year and each elected trustee shall serve for a two-year term. Each appointed trustee shall serve for a two-year term.
In the event of the death, retirement, resignation or other incapacitation of an elected or appointed trustee occurring more than ninety days prior to expiration of his or her term, a
TITLE 9 67
special election will be conducted within thirty days to fill the unexpired term of an elected trustee and the chief of police shall appoint a qualified member to fill the unexpired term of an appointed trustee. The terms of elected and appointed trustees shall commence on July 1 of the year elected or appointed.
The chief of police shall be president, the board shall elect a vice president, and the chief financial officer of the city shall act as treasurer of the board.

9-08-03. Investment of Surplus. At the end of the fiscal year, the board of trustees may invest any surplus left in the police department employees’ pension fund, but no part of moneys realized from any tax levy shall be used for any purposes other than the payment of pensions. Surplus funds may be invested in interest-bearing bonds of the United States or the state, or bonds or warrants of any county, township, or municipal corporation of this state which constitutes the general obligations or contingent general obligations of the issuing tax authority, or investments with any federally-insured bank or savings and loan association. All securities shall be deposited with the treasurer of the board for safekeeping. The board may also invest all or part of surplus funds in other investments by selecting a funding agent or agents and establishing an investment agreement contract regarding surplus funds. The contract shall authorize the funding agent or agents to hold and invest funds for the board. Funds shall be placed for investment only with a firm or firms whose primary endeavor is money management, and only after a trust agreement or contract has been executed.
In no event shall any part of the city police department employees’ pension fund be paid to or become vested in the city, or be used for any purpose whatsoever other than for the exclusive benefit of contributing members, former contributing members and their beneficiaries, except as provided in section 9-08-21 and section 9-08-23, except that contributions of the city may be returned if:
1. The contribution was conditioned on the qualification of the plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a), the plan does not so qualify and the contribution is returned within one year after the plan is found to not so qualify; or
2. The contribution was made due to a mistake of
TITLE 9 68
fact, the contribution is returned within one year of the mistaken payment of the contribution and the return satisfies the requirements of the last paragraph of this section.
The return of a contribution (or a portion of a contribution) to the city satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the amount so returned (a) does not exceed the excess of the contribution over the amount which could have been contributed and there has been no mistake of fact; (b) does not include the net earnings attributable to such excess contributions; and (c) is reduced by any net losses attributable to the excess contribution.

Any employee who seeks credit for military service shall, upon return to the employment of the city, pay into the fund for each year of military service nine and four tenths percent (9.4%) of the last full year’s salary paid by the city, or annual military pay, whichever is the lesser amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective December 12, 1994, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 414(u).

9-08-09. Contribution of City. The board of city commissioners shall annually levy a tax as may be needed to maintain the pension fund in a sound actuarial condition, the proceeds of which shall be placed in the police pension fund. The levy shall be in addition to any other levies authorized by law for a general purpose; provided, however, that when there is sufficient balance in the fund to meet any proper or legitimate charges that may be made against it, the city shall not be required to levy a tax for this purpose.
(Ord. 5151, 01-08-02)
9-08-10. Actuary. The pension and retirement system shall be based upon actuarial tables and the board of trustees shall, from time to time, be empowered to engage the services of an actuary for the purpose of determining the condition of the fund. The actuary shall be paid by check issued by the board of trustees in a reasonable amount determined by the board of trustees.
In calculating the actuarial equivalence of one form of benefit to another, the interest rate to be used shall be 7% and the mortality table to be used shall be the “applicable mortality table”, defined as the mortality table based upon the Internal Revenue Service Commissioner's standard table used to determine reserves for group annuity contracts issued on the date as of which present value is determined, as published by
TITLE 9 70
the Department of the Treasury for purposes of Section 417(e)(3) of the Code.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective January 1, 2000, for the purpose of determining the lump sum value of a participant's benefit, the interest rate shall be the “applicable interest rate”, defined as the annual interest rate on 30-year United States Treasury Securities as published by the Department of the Treasury and Federal Reserve as in effect for the second month (the “look-back month”) preceding the first day of the “stability period.” The “stability period” shall be the plan year.
(Ord. 5226, 01-07-03)

(Ord. 5151, 01-08-02)
9-08-13. Regulations Governing Fund. The board of trustees shall be authorized from time to time to adopt such regulations as may be deemed necessary, consistent with the terms and provisions of this chapter governing the operation of the fund and the requirements as to members and payments to beneficiaries. Each member and beneficiary shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter and to all the rules and regulations adopted by the board of trustees, and shall furnish to the board of trustees such information affecting his or her status as a member or beneficiary of the system as the board of trustees may require.
9-08-14. Refund of Contribution. Any employee of the police department subject to provisions of this chapter who has contributed to the pension and retirement system adopted under Chapter 174 of the Sessions Law of 1936, continued on to Chapter V of the Revised Ordinance of 1966, or revised ordinances of 1973, and discontinued, who leaves employment shall be entitled upon application at the time of termination of employment to a refund of the employee's "entire interest." The employee's entire interest shall be the sum of all an employee's contributions made under Section 9-08-01 plus interest earnings at two and one-half percent (2.5%) per annum on contributions made through 1972 and plus interest earnings at five percent
TITLE 9 71
(5%) per annum on all employee contributions thereafter. No rights to pension benefits shall accrue to any employees or their beneficiaries during any leave of absence, except this clause shall not be construed to deprive any employee of pension benefits accrued during the regular annual leave or sick leave or absence duly granted, as provided by this chapter, nor to any employee referred to in section 9-08-05.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, effective with respect to distributions on or after March 28, 2005, any account with a value that exceeds $1000, including any rollover amounts, shall not be distributed to the participant during his/her lifetime and prior to his/her normal retirement date as set in this chapter, without the consent of the participant.
Any member of this pension retirement system who leaves the employment of the police department and elects a refund in accordance with this section forfeits all rights to any other form of benefit under this pension retirement system.
(Ord. 4945, 09-22-98; Ord. 5042, 04-11-00; Ord. 5151, 01-08-02; Ord. 5378, 12-28-04; Ord. 5573, 03-13-07)
9-08-15. Pension Eligibility; Computations; Required Distributions. Every member of the police department who is a participant in the police pension fund pursuant to Section 9-08-11 or the surviving spouse of any such employee who is deceased, provided said participant or said surviving spouse has made application to the board of trustees and been certified by the board of trustees as entitled to a pension, shall be paid out of the police pension fund an amount determined in accordance with the following:
1. Any contributing member who has served in active employment until the age of fifty-five is eligible for a monthly pension benefit computed by multiplying his or her highest thirty-six months (or total months of employment, if less) of average basic monthly compensation times two percent and then multiplying that resultant product by his or her number of full and fractional years of recognized service as defined in Section 9-08-22. Effective January 1, 2005, "two percent" in the foregoing sentence shall be replaced with "two and a half percent." Effective January 1, 2005, the maximum monthly pension benefit payable shall not exceed ninety percent of the average of the participant's compensation for the highest thirty-six months of his or her employment as a member of the police department.
“Average basic monthly compensation” means the average of the monthly base compensation of a participant over the thirty-six month period described above. “Monthly base compensation” means the monthly base compensation paid by the city to the participant, excluding the following:
TITLE 9 72
(a) overtime;
(b) bonuses;
(c) severance payments; and
(d) other remuneration in excess of base compensation.
All elective contributions made by the city on behalf of an employee that are not includible in the gross income of the employee under Code Sections 125, 132(f)(4), 402(e)(3), 402(h) and 403(b) shall be included in monthly base compensation.
Effective for benefits accruing after December 31, 1988, the annual compensation of each employee taken into account under the plan shall not exceed $200,000 ($150,000 for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1996), as adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for the cost of living adjustments. For fiscal years prior to January 1, 1997, in determining the compensation of an employee, the rules of Internal Revenue Code Section 414 (q)(6) shall apply, except that the term "family" shall include only the spouse of the employee and any lineal descendants of the employee who have not attained age 19 before the close of the plan year.
2. Any contributing member who has served at least sixty consecutive months of contributing service in the employment of the police department and has attained at least age forty-eight is eligible for a monthly pension benefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any member who terminated employment or retired from the city prior to January 1, 2002, the phrase "sixty consecutive months" in the foregoing sentence shall be replaced with "one hundred twenty (120) consecutive months." The monthly pension benefit shall be equal to the accrued normal retirement benefit as determined under subsection 1 of this section 9-08-15 and then multiplied by the actuarial factor set forth below, interpolated to the nearest monthly age at the date upon which the pension benefits commence.

3. Any contributing member who has served at least 60 consecutive months of contributing service in the employment of the police department and terminates employment with the police department may elect a deferred retirement benefit to commence at an elected age from age forty-eight to fifty-five. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any member who terminated employment with the city prior to January 1, 2002, the phrase "60 consecutive months" in the foregoing sentence shall be replaced with "one hundred twenty (120) consecutive months." The deferred benefit shall be equal to the member’s accrued normal retirement benefit as determined under subsection 1 of this section 9-08-15, (based upon service and compensation to the date of employment termination) multiplied by the actuarial equivalent factor set forth in subsection 2 of this section 9-08-15 determined on the basis of the age elected for deferred benefits to commence.
4. To the surviving spouse as long as he or she remains unmarried, a sum equal to two-thirds of the amount of pension earned by the member under this plan to the date of his or her death, but not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month, provided the employee served at least sixty consecutive months of contributing service in the employment of the police department. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any member who died prior to January 1, 2002, the phrase "sixty consecutive months" in the foregoing sentence shall be replaced with "one hundred twenty (120) consecutive months." The term "surviving spouse" shall mean only the surviving spouse of a deceased employee if such spouse was married to the employee on the date the employee separated from service and the separation from service occurred after the plan’s effective date, or of an employee who retired prior to the date this plan took effect if such spouse was married to such employee on the plan’s effective date.
5. A surviving spouse has the option to withdraw all of the employee's entire interest, as defined in Section 9-08-14. A surviving spouse who elects to withdraw an employee's entire interest does so in lieu of all benefits outlined in subsection 4 of this section.
6. If there is no surviving spouse, then the employee’s entire interest, as defined in Section 9-08-14, will be paid to the employee’s estate.
7. Distribution Upon Death.
(a) Death After Commencement of Benefits. If
TITLE 9 74
distribution of an employee’s interest has begun in accordance with subsection 1, 2 or 3 of this section 9-08-15, and the employee dies before his entire interest has been distributed to him or her, then the remaining portion of such interest shall be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of his or her death.
(b) Death Before Commencement of Benefits. If an employee dies before distribution of the employee’s interest has begun, the entire interest of the employee shall be distributed no later than December 31 of the calendar year which contains the fifth anniversary of the date of the employee's death.
This five-year distribution rule shall not apply if: (1) any portion of the employee's interest (or of the deceased spouse of such employee, as provided below) is payable to or for the benefit of a designated beneficiary, as determined pursuant to Proposed Treasury Regulation § 1.401(a)(9)-1 (or any successor regulation); (2) this portion will be distributed over the life of the designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary); and (3) the distributions commence no later than December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the employee died. If the surviving spouse is the beneficiary and dies before payments are deemed to have begun, the five-year distribution rule and the exception to it stated in this paragraph are to be applied as if the surviving spouse were the employee and the spouse's date of death shall be substituted for the employee's date of death.
This five-year distribution rule shall also not apply if: (1) the portion of the employee's interest to which the surviving spouse is entitled will be distributed over the life of the surviving spouse (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the surviving spouse, which may be recalculated not more frequently than annually); and (2) the distributions commence on or before the later of December 31 of the calendar year in which the employee would have attained age 70½ or December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the employee died.
(c) Designated Beneficiary. For purposes of this section, the term "designated beneficiary" means any
TITLE 9 75
individual designated as a beneficiary by the employee.
8. Required Distributions. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary, the following provisions shall control:
(a) General Rule. The entire interest of each employee shall be distributed to such employee not later than the required beginning date (as defined below), or will be distributed, beginning not later than the required beginning date, in accordance with regulations, over the life of such employee or over the lives of such employee and a designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such employee or the life expectancy of such employee and a designated beneficiary).
(b) Required Beginning Date. For purposes of this section, the term "required beginning date" means April first of the calendar year following the later of (i) the calendar year in which the employee attains age seventy and one-half or (ii) the calendar year in which the employee retires.
Any participant who attains age 70½ on or prior to December 31, 2001, shall be entitled to commence distributions on the required beginning date set forth in the foregoing sentence or, if earlier, as of April 1 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant attains age 70½. Any participant who attained age 70½ prior to January 1, 2001, and who has not yet terminated employment with the City, may elect to stop distributions and recommence distributions by the April 1 of the calendar year following the year in which the participant retires. The recommencement of distributions shall not be considered a new annuity starting date for which spousal consent is required, except as spousal consent may be required under IRS Notice 97-75, 1997-2 C.B. 337.
(c) Designated Beneficiary. For purposes of this section, the term "designated beneficiary" means any individual designated as a beneficiary by the employee.
(d) Continued Service Beyond Age 55. An employee may at his or her own request be continued in employment beyond age 55. In such event no retirement benefit will be paid to such employee until he or she
TITLE 9 76
actually retires, subject, however, to any required minimum distributions pursuant to Section 9-08-15. Such an employee shall continue to accrue credit for years of service after attainment of age 55 and changes in average basic monthly compensation shall also be taken into account.
(e) With respect to distributions under the police pension plan made for calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, the plan will apply the minimum distribution requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code in accordance with the regulations under section 401(a)(9) that were proposed on January 17, 2001, notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary. This amendment shall continue in effect until the end of the last calendar year beginning before the effective date of final regulations under section 401(a)(9) or such other date as may be specified in guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, effective July 1, 1974, any surviving spouse currently receiving less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month shall commence to receive one hundred dollars per month.
(Ord. 4300, 10-17-89; Ord. 4997, 07-13-99; Ord. 5042, 04-11-00; Ord. 5151, 01-08-02; Ord. 5226, 01-07-03; Ord. 5366, 11-09-04; Ord. 5378, 12-28-04)
9-08-16. Cost of Living Adjustment Procedure. Persons receiving pension payments under the provision of this chapter shall be eligible for cost of living adjustments in an amount determined by the board of trustees. The adjustment, if any, will be effective at the same time as the city employees’ salary adjustment is made in the same year. The adjustment may not exceed the lesser of:
1. The city employees' adjustment; or
2. 3%.
Cost of living adjustments shall be made in respect to pensioners and surviving spouses who are receiving pension benefits at the time the cost of living adjustments are made hereunder.
(Ord. 4879, 12-09-97; Ord. 5042, 04-11-00; Ord. 5151, 01-08-02)
9-08-17. Optional Settlements and Life Annuity Limitations. Any optional settlements under this plan shall be limited to the life expectancy of the participating member or the surviving spouse of the participating member. In no event is an "interest only" option permissible whereunder the total payout would extend beyond the life expectancy of the member and the member’s spouse. The following restrictions and limitations shall apply to benefit payments.
TITLE 9 77
1. Benefit Limited to Maximum Permissible Benefit. The Annual Benefit otherwise payable to a member at any time shall not exceed the Maximum Permissible Benefit. If the benefit the member would otherwise accrue in a Limitation Year would produce an Annual Benefit in excess of the Maximum Permissible Benefit, the rate of accrual shall be limited, or the rate of accrual reduced, to a benefit that does not exceed the Maximum Permissible Benefit.
2. Adjustment if in Two or More Defined Benefit Plans. If the member is, or has ever been, a member of another qualified defined benefit plan (without regard to whether the plan has been terminated) maintained by the city, the sum of the member’s Annual Benefits from all such plans may not exceed the Maximum Permissible Benefit. Where the member’s employer-provided benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the Maximum Permissible Benefit applicable at that age, the city shall limit a member’s benefit in accordance with the terms of the plans.
3. Definitions. For purposes of this Section 9-08-17, the following terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below, unless expressly provided for herein, and when the defined meaning is intended, the term is capitalized.
a. “Annual Benefit” means a benefit that is payable annually in the form of a Straight Life Annuity. Except as provided below, where a benefit is payable in a Straight Life Annuity, the benefit shall be adjusted to an actuarially equivalent Straight Life Annuity that begins at the same time as such other form of benefit and is payable on the first day of each month before applying the limitations of this Section 9-08-17. For a member who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one Annuity Starting Date, the Annual Benefit shall be determined as of each such Annuity Starting Date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this Section 9-08-17 as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other Annuity Starting Dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new Annuity Starting Date has occurred shall be made without regard to Regulations Section 1. 401(b)-20, Q&A 10(d), and with regard to Regulations Section 1.415(b)-1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C).
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made
TITLE 9 78
for (1) survivor benefits payable to a surviving spouse under a qualified joint and survivor annuity to the extent such benefits would not be payable if the member’s benefit were paid in another form; (2) benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or (3) the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to Code Section 417(e)(3) and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this Section 9-08-17, and the Plan provides that the amount payable under the form of benefit in any Limitation Year shall not exceed the limits of this Section 9-08-17 applicable at the Annuity Starting Date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d). For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form.
The determination of the Annual Benefit shall take into account benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits pursuant Regulations Section 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c), but shall disregard benefits attributable to member contributions or rollover contributions.
Effective for distributions in Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2003, the determination of actuarial equivalence of forms of benefit other than a Straight Life Annuity shall be made in accordance with (i) or (ii) below.
(i) Benefit forms not subject to Code Section 417(e)(3). The Straight Life Annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the member’s form of benefit shall be determined under this subsection (i) if the form of the member’s benefit is either (1) a nondecreasing annuity (other than a Straight Life Annuity) payable for a period of not less than the life of the member (or, in the case of a qualified pre-retirement survivor annuity, the life of the surviving spouse), or (2) an annuity that decreases during the life of the member merely because of (A) the death of the survivor annuitant (but only if the reduction is not below 50% of the benefit payable before the death of the survivor annuitant), or (B) the cessation or reduction of Social Security supplements or qualified disability payments (as
TITLE 9 79
defined in Code Section 401(a)(11)).
(1) Limitation Years beginning before July 1, 2007. For Limitation Years beginning before July 1, 2007, the actuarially equivalent Straight Life Annuity is equal to the annual amount of the Straight Life Annuity commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit computed using whichever of the following produces the greater annual amount: (I) the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the Plan for adjusting benefits in the same form; and (II) 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table under Section 417(e)(3) of the Code for the calendar year in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs.
(2) Limitation Years beginning on or after July 1, 2007. For Limitation Years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the actuarially equivalent Straight Life Annuity is equal to the greater of (a) the annual amount of the Straight Life Annuity (if any) payable to the member under the Plan commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date as the member’s form of benefit; and (b) the annual amount of the Straight Life Annuity commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table under Section 417(e)(3) of the Code for the calendar year in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs.
(ii) Benefit Forms Subject to Code Section 417(e)(3). The Straight Life Annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the member’s form of benefit shall be determined under this paragraph if the form of the member’s benefit is other than a benefit form described in subsection 3(a)(i) above. The actuarially equivalent Straight Life Annuity is equal to the greatest of (a) the annual amount of the Straight Life Annuity commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using the interest rate and mortality table (or other
TITLE 9 80
tabular factor) specified in the Plan for adjusting benefits in the same form; (b) the annual amount of the Straight Life Annuity commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using a 5.5 percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table under Section 417(e)(3) of the Code for the calendar year in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs; and (c) the annual amount of the Straight Life Annuity commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using the applicable interest rate and applicable mortality table, both as described in Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, divided by 1.05.
b. “Maximum Permissible Benefit” means, effective for Limitation Years ending after December 31, 2001, $160,000, automatically adjusted under Code Section 415(d), effective January 1 of each year, as published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, and payable in the form of a Straight Life Annuity. The new limitation shall apply to Limitation Years ending with or within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment, but a member’s benefits shall not reflect the adjusted limit prior to January 1 of that calendar year.
(i) Adjustment for Less Than 10 Years of Participation or Service: If the member has less than 10 years of participation in the Plan, the Maximum Permissible Benefit shall be multiplied by a fraction -- (i) the numerator of which is the number of Years of Participation in the Plan (or part thereof, but not less than one year), and (ii) the denominator of which is ten (10). In the case of a member who has less than ten Years of Service with the city, the Maximum Permissible Benefit shall be multiplied by a fraction -- (i) the numerator of which is the number of Years of Service with the city (or part thereof, but not less than one year), and (ii) the denominator of which is ten (10).
(ii) Adjustment for Benefit Commencement Before Age 62 or after Age 65: Effective for benefits commencing in Limitation Years ending after December 31, 2001, the Maximum Permissible Benefit shall be adjusted if the Annuity Starting
TITLE 9 81
Date of the member’s benefit is before age 62 or after age 65.
(iii) Adjustment for Benefit Commencement Before Age 62:
(1) Limitation Years Beginning Before July 1, 2007. If the Annuity Starting Date for the member’s benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning before July 1, 2007, the Maximum Permissible Benefit for the member’s Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a Straight Life Annuity commencing at the member’s Annuity Starting Date that is the actuarial equivalent of the Maximum Permissible benefit (adjusted under subsection (i) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount: (a) the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the Plan; or (b) a five-percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table as defined in the Plan.
(2) Limitation Years Beginning on or After July 1, 2007.
(A) Plan Does Not Have Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at both Age 62 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the Annuity Starting Date for the member’s benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan does not have an immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement, the Maximum Permissible Benefit for the member’s Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a Straight Life Annuity commencing at the member’s Annuity Starting Date that is the actuarial equivalent of the Maximum Permissible Benefit (adjusted under subsection(i) for years of participation less than ten (10), if
TITLE 9 82
required) with actuarial equivalence computed using a five-percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for the Annuity Starting Date as defined in the Plan (and expressing the member’s age based on completed calendar months as of the Annuity Starting Date).
(B) Plan Has Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at both Age 62 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the Annuity Starting Date for the member’s benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan has an immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation for the member’s Annuity Starting Date is the lesser of the limitation determined under subsection (b)(iii) and the Maximum Permissible benefit (adjusted under subsection (i) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity under the Plan at the member’s Annuity Starting Date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity under the Plan at age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of this Section 9-08-17.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no age adjustment to the Maximum Permissible Benefit shall be required for commencement of benefits before age 62 for any member who is a full-time employee of any police department or fire department that is organized and operated by the city to provide police protection, firefighting services, or emergency medical services for any area within the jurisdiction of the city and with respect to whom the service taken into account in determining the amount of the benefit under the plan includes at least 15 years of service of the
TITLE 9 83
member. For purposes of this section, only the classification of the city, not the job classification of the member, is relevant in determining whether this paragraph applies.
(iv) Adjustment of Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation for Benefit Commencement After Age 65:
(1) Limitation Years Beginning Before July 1, 2007. If the Annuity Starting Date for the member’s benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning before July 1, 2007, the Maximum Permissible Benefit for the member’s Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a Straight Life Annuity commencing at the member’s Annuity Starting Date that is the actuarial equivalent of the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation (adjusted under subsection (i) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount: (A) the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the Plan; or (B) a five-percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table under Section 417(e)(3) for the calendar year in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs.
(2) Limitation Years Beginning on or After July 1, 2007.
(A) Plan Does Not Have Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at both Age 65 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the annuity starting date for the member’s benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan does not have an immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the Maximum Permissible Benefit at the member’s Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a Straight Life Annuity commencing at the member’s Annuity
TITLE 9 84
Starting Date that is the actuarial equivalent of the Maximum Permissible Benefit (adjusted under subsection(i)for years of participation less than 10, if required), with actuarial equivalence computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table under Section 417(e)(3) for the calendar year in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs (and expressing the member’s age based on completed calendar months as of the Annuity Starting Date).
(B) Plan Has Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at both Age 65 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the Annuity Starting Date for the member’s benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the plan has an immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the Maximum Permissible Benefit at the member’s Annuity Starting Date is the lesser of the limitation determined under subsection 3(b)(iv) and the Maximum Permissible Benefit (adjusted under subsection (i) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity under the Plan at the member’s Annuity Starting Date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity under the Plan at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of this Section 9-08-17. For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity under the Plan at the member’s Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the member, computed disregarding the member’s accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted
TITLE 9 85
immediately commencing Straight Life Annuity under the Plan at age 65 is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the Plan to a hypothetical member who is age 65 and has the same accrued benefit as the member.
(v) Notwithstanding the other requirements of this section, no adjustment shall be made to the Maximum Permissible Benefit to reflect the probability of a member’s death between the Annuity Starting Date and age 62, or between age 65 and the Annuity Starting Date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member prior to the Annuity Starting Date. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the Annuity Starting Date, such an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the member’s death if the Plan does not charge members for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, as defined in Code Section 417(c), upon the member’s death.
(vi) Minimum benefit permitted: Notwithstanding anything else in this Section to the contrary, the benefit otherwise accrued or payable to a member under this Plan shall be deemed not to exceed the Maximum Permissible Benefit if:
(1) the retirement benefits payable for a Limitation Year under any form of benefit with respect to such member under this Plan and under all other defined benefit plans (without regard to whether a plan has been terminated) ever maintained by the city do not exceed $10,000 multiplied by a fraction – (a) the numerator of which is the member’s number of Years (or part thereof, but not less than one year) of Service (not to exceed ten (10)) with the city, and (b) the denominator of which is ten (10); and
(2) the city has not at any time maintained a defined contribution plan in which the member participated (for this purpose, mandatory member contributions under a defined benefit plan, individual medical accounts under Code Section 401(h),
TITLE 9 86
and accounts for post-retirement medical benefits established under Code Section 419A(d)(1) are not considered a separate defined contribution plan).
c. “Straight Life Annuity” means an annuity payable in equal installments for the life of a member that terminates upon the member’s death.
4. Application of Code Section 415. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, this Section shall be construed in a manner which is consistent with Code Section 415 (which is hereby incorporated herein.) and the rulings and regulations issued there under.
(Ord. 4879, 12-09-97; Ord. 5042, 04-11-00; Ord. 5151, 01-08-02; Ord. 5226, 01-07-03; Ord. 5750, 12-22-09)
9-08-18. Reduction of Pension. Whenever the amount realized from the tax levy, assessment upon salary, fees, gifts and grants as herein provided for, shall be insufficient to meet the demands of the withdrawals due to retirement or disability, the board of trustees shall have the power and authority, in order to safeguard the future of this plan and for the future purpose of ensuring that there be no accumulated liability upon the city for unpaid pensions, to make such adjustments and such apportionments of the pensions to be paid as in their judgment will safeguard the police department employee pension fund and safeguard the city from any accumulative liability for pension except such as is provided by the amount of levy authorized by the police employees' pension law. For that purpose and to that end the board of trustees may in their judgment make such reductions and apportionments in the payments of the amount to the employees entitled to a pension or their dependents as is available and increase contributions in a manner to safeguard the future of the pension plan.
9-08-19. Direct Rollovers.
1. General Rule. If a “distributee” of any “eligible rollover distribution”:
(a) elects to have such eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an “eligible retirement plan,” and
(b) specifies the eligible retirement plan to which such eligible rollover distribution is to be paid (in such form and at such time as the city may prescribe), such eligible rollover distribution shall be made in the form of a “direct rollover” to the eligible retirement plan so specified by the distributee.
TITLE 9 87
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this section 9-08-19 shall apply only to the extent the eligible rollover distribution would be includible in gross income if not transferred as provided above.
2. Definitions.
A “direct rollover” is an eligible rollover distribution that is paid directly to an eligible retirement plan for the benefit of the distributee.
“Distributee” means the employee or the surviving spouse of an employee.
An “eligible retirement plan” is an individual retirement account described in Internal Revenue Code Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity (other than an endowment contract) described in Internal Revenue Code Section 408(b), a qualified defined contribution retirement plan that accepts rollover distributions, or an annuity plan described in Internal Revenue Code Section 403(a) that accepts rollover distributions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the distributee is the employee’s surviving spouse, “eligible retirement plan” shall mean either an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity (other than an endowment contract).
For the purposes of the direct rollover provisions in this Section 9-08-19, for distributions made after December 31, 2001, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b) and an eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Code Section 414(p).
“Eligible rollover distribution” means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of an employee in a qualified plan, provided, however, that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:
(a) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments, not less frequently than annually, for the life or life expectancy of the distributee, or for the joint lives
TITLE 9 88
or life expectancies of the distributee and his or her spouse or designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of 10 years or more;
(b) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9), relating to minimum distribution requirements; or
(c) the portion of any distribution that is not includible in income.
3. Procedures.
(a) In General. The city may prescribe any procedure for a distributee to elect a direct rollover provided the procedure is reasonable. Such procedure may include any reasonable requirement for information or documentation from the distributee.
(b) Notice and Waiver of Notice Period. At least thirty (30) days and no more than ninety (90) days before making any distribution subject to this section 9-08-19, the city shall provide to the distributee a written explanation of the rules concerning direct rollovers, income tax withheld on distributions not rolled over, and any other information required by Internal Revenue Code Section 402(f) (the “402(f) notice”). Such distribution may commence less than 30 days after the 402(f) notice is given, provided that: (i) the city clearly informs the employee that the employee has a right to a period of at least 30 days after receiving the 402(f) notice to consider the decision of whether or not to elect a distribution (and, if applicable, a particular distribution option), and (ii) the employee, after receiving the 402(f) notice, affirmatively elects a distribution.
(c) $500 Rule. A distributee may elect to have a portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid to an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover and to have the remainder paid to the distributee only if the portion paid to the eligible retirement plan equals at least $500.
(d) Direct Rollover to One Account Only. An eligible rollover distribution (or portion thereof) may be distributed in a direct rollover only to a single eligible retirement plan selected by the distributee.
TITLE 9 89
(e) $200 Rule. A distributee may not elect a direct rollover with respect to eligible rollover distributions during a year if such distributions are reasonably expected to total less than $200.
(f) Method of Making a Direct Rollover. The city may accomplish a direct rollover by any reasonable means of direct payment to an eligible retirement plan including providing a distributee with a check payable to the eligible retirement plan with instructions to the distributee to deliver the check to the eligible retirement plan.
(g) Default Option. If the distributee does not so elect or does not provide the required information in the form and at the time required by the city, the city shall direct that the distribution be made directly to the distributee and to withhold income taxes on such distribution equal to 20% of the value of such distribution (or such other amount provided under Internal Revenue Code Section 3405(c), as amended). Provided, however, that the city shall not make a distribution under this default option earlier than the date which is 60 days after the distributee is provided with the 402(f) notice. The city shall not withhold tax from an eligible rollover distribution if such distribution is not subject to a direct rollover election because the distribution was not reasonably expected to total $200 in the year.
(h) Periodic Payments. If a distribution subject to this section 9-08-19 is to be paid in a series of periodic payments that are eligible rollover distributions, the following rules shall apply:
(i) a distributee's election to make or not make a direct rollover with respect to a single payment shall control whether a direct rollover is made of all subsequent payments unless the distributee changes the previous election; and
(ii) the city shall provide the 402(f) notice described in the foregoing paragraph at least once annually for as long as the periodic payments continue.
(Ord. 5151, 01-08-02; Ord. 5268, 08-12-03)
9-08-20. Pension Claims Theretofore Allowed. There shall be paid out of the police employee pension fund pension claims theretofore allowed in the same amounts as were in effect on the date of discontinuance of the employees' pension plan under Article I of Chapter V of the Revised Ordinance of 1966, until
TITLE 9 90
the death or disqualification of the pension claimant in the manner as if the plan has been continued.
9-08-21. Variable Annuity; Application of Contributions.
1. For receipt of any benefits, a member must make application through the city and such benefits will be paid by and controlled by the city. Benefit payments from an executed trust agreement or contract with an insurance company will be paid to the city for distribution of the eligible recipient.
2. Prior to January 1, 2005, a member may have the option of having his or her contributions invested in fixed income investments or equity variable income investments or any permissible combination. Effective January 1, 2005, members shall have no investment authority with regard to any assets of the plan, including contributions made pursuant to Section 9-08-01 and earnings thereon. The City shall direct the investment of all plan assets.
3. The pension benefits available under Section 9-08-15(1)-(3) shall be provided from all plan assets, whether contributed pursuant to Section 9-08-01 or Section 9-08-09 or whether attributable to earnings on such contributions.
4. Effective January 1, 2005, all contributions made prior to January 1, 2005, pursuant to Section 9-08-01 on behalf of an employee plus net investment earnings thereon up to an amount that is equal to said contributions plus interest at five percent per annum accumulated through December 31, 2004, shall be transferred into the control of the City to be used to pay benefits as provided in this chapter and shall no longer be invested at the direction of the employee. If, as of January 1, 2005, said contributions plus net earnings exceeds an amount that is equal to said contributions plus interest at five percent per annum accumulated through December 31, 2004, the excess amount will be determined and will be placed into an account that will continue to be invested at the direction of the employee (hereinafter the “excess amount”). No further contributions made pursuant to Section 9-08-01 or any other provision of this chapter shall be directed into an employee’s excess account or be subject to the investment direction of the employee.
5. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, forfeitures of benefits under this pension retirement system because an employee leaves the employ of the city for any reason shall not be used to increase the pension benefits any member would otherwise receive under the plan
TITLE 9 91
at any time prior to termination of the plan or the complete discontinuance of contributions, and any amounts so forfeited shall be used as soon as possible to reduce the city's contributions under the plan.
(Ord. 5151, 01-08-02; Ord. 5366, 11-09-04)
9-08-22. Recognized Service. Recognized service prior to December 28, 1971, shall be based upon recognized service according to the city's record as applicable under the pension ordinances in effect at that time. Recognized service subsequent to that time shall be defined as full and fractional years of service during which (a) the employee contributed to the police pension fund pursuant to Section 9-08-01 and (b) the employee was a participant pursuant to Section 9-08-11.
(Ord. 5151, 01-08-02)
9-08-23. Additional Internal Revenue Code Requirement.
1. It is hereby expressly provided that upon the partial or complete termination of the police employees pension system, or upon the complete discontinuance of contributions hereunder, the rights of each employee to benefits accrued to the date of termination or discontinuance, to the extent then funded, or the rights of each employee to the amounts credited to his or her account at the time, shall become non-forfeitable. This requirement shall not apply in respect to benefits for the twenty-five highest paid employees to the extent such benefits may be restricted in the event of early termination in accordance with the requirements of section 9-08-24.
2. It is further provided that any previously unallocated funds shall be allocated to the employees covered by this program in the event of termination or complete discontinuance of contributions under the police employees’ pension system. The allocation shall be in the following order. The total allocation shall represent the actuarial reserve requirements for benefits accrued under the plan and may be distributed either in the form of cash or deferred annuities.
(a) All employees’ total contribution accounts with accumulated income.
(b) All retired participants or beneficiaries receiving payments (reserves in excess of (a) above).
(c) All vested participants (reserves in excess of (a) above).
(d) All others (reserves in excess of (a) above).
TITLE 9 92
3. In no event shall the city receive any amounts from the pension fund upon termination of the police employees’ pension system, except that, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, the city shall receive such amounts, if any, as may remain after the satisfaction of all liabilities of the plan and arising out of any variations between actual requirements and expected actuarial requirements.
In the event there are not sufficient assets to fully comply with the reserve requirements of any of the groups defined above the total remaining assets shall be allocated to that group on a pro rata basis based upon actuarial reserve requirements.
(Ord. 5042, 04-11-00; Ord. 5151, 01-08-02)
9-08-24. Early Termination.
1. If the plan is terminated or the full current costs are not met within ten years after its establishment or until the full current costs are funded for the first time, the amount of the fund to be used for the benefit of any employee or the beneficiary of any employee who is among the twenty-five highest paid employees of the employer at the time the plan is established, and whose anticipated annual benefit exceeds one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) shall not exceed the larger of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) or twenty percent of the first fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) of his or her annual average compensation multiplied by the number of years between the effective date of this agreement and:
(a) Termination of the plan;
(b) Date the benefit of the employee becomes payable, if before the date of the termination plan;
(c) Date of the failure to meet the full current costs of the plan.
(d) Any excess reserves arising by application of the foregoing provisions shall be used and applied equitably for the benefit of other employees, retired employees and their beneficiaries and beneficiaries of deceased retired employees on the basis of the value of the respective portions of the full retirement allowance accrued to the date of termination of the plan to the employees.
(Ord. 5151, 01-08-02)
9-08-25. How Pension Paid. All pensions paid and all money drawn from the pension fund under the provisions of this chapter shall be upon checks authorized by the board of trustees, and
TITLE 9 93
issued by the treasurer of the board. Each check shall designate the name of the person and purpose for which payment is made. The treasurer’s annual report shall show the receipts and expenditures of the fund for the preceding fiscal year, the money on hand and how invested. The report shall be made to the board of trustees and shall be filed with the city administrator.

CHAPTER 10-03.1. SIDEWALK, CURB AND GUTTER SPECIAL FUND
10-03.1-01. Special Fund Established. It is hereby found and determined that the City of Bismarck has for many years maintained a separate fund designated as the "Sidewalk, Curb and Gutter Special Fund," pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Chapters 40-29 and 40-31 (the "Chapters") of the North Dakota Century Code, as amended ("NDCC") and has issued warrants thereon in accordance with the provisions of Chapters; that in accordance with said Chapters, the City has duly levied special assessments for the payment of the cost of sidewalks and curbing constructed, rebuilt or repaired thereunder and has appropriated the same to the said Sidewalk, Curb and Gutter Special Fund for the payment of principal and interest on said warrants; that under NDCC Section 40-29-14 and 40-31-08, whenever all taxes and assessments collected are insufficient to pay the warrants issued with interest, this Board is required upon the maturity of the last warrant, to levy a tax upon all of the taxable property in the City for the payment of such deficiency and is authorized to levy such tax whenever a deficiency exists in the fund or is likely to occur within one year; that in order to equalize and reduce the burden of the taxes which the City may be required to levy for the payment of deficiencies in said Sidewalk, Curb and Gutter Special Fund as required by NDCC Sections 40-29-14 and 40-31-08, it is necessary to establish a uniform policy for the administration of said fund and the issuance of warrants thereon, and for the levy of taxes from year to year in the amounts required to prevent the accumulation of deficiencies therein, and that from and after the final passage and adoption of this ordinance the provisions hereof shall govern the administration of said fund and the issuance of said warrants, provided that the City reserves the right to amend or supplement this ordinance as the need therefor may arise, to such extent as will not impair the rights of holders of such warrants under said Chapters.
(Editor's Note: Chapter 10-03.1 was adopted as Ordinance No. 3983 on May 22, 1984. The ordinance was apparently misplaced and was consequently never published by the city's former code publisher, and therefore was not included in the 1986 Revised Code. However, the ordinance remained in effect, pursuant to the provisions of section 3 of Ordinance No. 4103, when the 1986 Revised Code was adopted. When the oversight was discovered, Ordinance No. 3983 was codified as Chapter 10-03.1.)
10-03.1-02. Administration of Special Fund. Said Sidewalk, Curb and Gutter Special Fund shall be continued as a separate and special fund of the City so long as any warrants drawn thereon shall be outstanding and unpaid, and shall be administered as follows: In said fund there shall be maintained a separate account to be designated as the "Construction Account", and upon the issuance of any warrants on said fund, the proceeds thereof which are not required to be credited to the Principal and Interest Account shall be credited to the "Construction Account", unless such warrants are delivered directly to a contractor in payment for sidewalk and curbing
Title 10 20
construction, rebuilding or repair. The moneys in said Construction Account shall be disbursed only in payment of sidewalk and curbing construction, rebuilding or repair ordered by this Board, as such expenses are incurred and allowed and costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the warrants and the levying of the assessments; provided that if, upon the completion of sidewalk and curbing work ordered in any calendar year there remains any unexpended balance in the Construction Account, such balance shall be transferred to the Principal and Interest Account for the payment of warrants issued during the current year, as described below. There shall also be maintained in said fund a Principal and Interest Account for the payment of the principal of premium, if any, and interest on the sidewalk, curb and gutter warrants to be issued against said fund from and after the adoption of this ordinance, as amended, commencing with 1955. The Principal and Interest Account shall be credited with any accrued interest paid as part of the purchase price, any capitalized interest and all special assessments or taxes levied and collected for the payment of the cost of sidewalk and curbing projects instituted during such year. The moneys in the Principal and Interest Account shall be used without further authorization or direction for the payment of the principal of premium, if any, and interest on the warrants as the same become due or for the redemption of warrants when and as the same are redeemable by their terms.
10-03.1-03. Assessments. Forthwith upon the completion of each project involving the construction, repair or rebuilding of sidewalks and curbing, the cost thereof shall be assessed against the lots or parcels of land properly chargeable therewith in accordance with the provisions of NDCC Sections 40-29-05 and 40-31-02, and on or before the 1st day of September of each year, the city auditor shall deliver to the county auditor a duplicate of all assessment rolls containing sidewalk and curbing assessments, which assessments shall be collected and the payment thereof enforced in the same manner as other taxes. All such assessments shall be payable in equal annual installments, extending over a period of not exceeding ten years and the unpaid portions thereof shall bear interest at an annual rate of not more than two percentage points above the average rate on the warrants. Such installments, if not theretofore paid, shall be certified and collected with the general taxes of the city for the year in which the assessment is levied and for each of the succeeding years. In the event that any such assessment shall at any time be held or claimed to be invalid due to any error or mistake in the making thereof, a reassessment or new assessment shall be made in lieu thereof and the city and all of its officers and employees shall take all such action and proceedings as may be necessary to make such assessment a valid and binding lien upon the property on which the same is levied.
Title 10 21
10-03.1-04. Deficiency. Annually, at the time of the preparation of the municipal budget, the city auditor shall compute the requirements and the current resources of the Principal and Interest Account of the Sidewalk, Curb and Gutter Special, Curb and Gutter Special Fund for the payment of the warrants drawn thereon, and an amount sufficient for the payment of any deficiency then existing or anticipated to occur within one year in said Principal and Interest Account shall be included in said budget and a tax shall be levied therefor and when collected shall be credited to such account. If at the last maturity of the warrants drawn on said account, the moneys in said account should be insufficient for the payment of all such warrants and accrued interest thereon, this Board shall levy a tax upon all of the taxable property in the city for the payment of such deficiency as a part of the annual tax levy thereafter made. All taxes levied and collected under the provisions of this section, in advance of the time when such levy is required by the provisions of NDCC Sections 40-29-14 and 40-31-08, as amended, shall be credited against the levies which the city would otherwise have become obligated to make under such sections.
10-03.1-05. Issuance of Warrants.
1. At any time after the award of a contract for sidewalk and curbing work under the provisions of NDCC Sections 40-29-08 and 40-31-04, the board of city commissioners may by resolution authorize the issuance of sidewalk, curb and gutter warrants in anticipation of the collection of special assessments to be levied and collected with respect to the construction, rebuilding and repairing of sidewalks, curb and gutter ordered during the then current year. Said warrants shall be drawn upon the Principal and Interest Account created in the Sidewalk, Curb and Gutter Special Fund and shall be issued upon such terms and conditions as set forth in the resolution providing for their issuance.
2. Said warrants shall be prepared for execution under the direction of the city auditor and shall be executed on behalf of the city by the manual or facsimile signature of the president of the board of city commissioners, countersigned by the manual or facsimile seal of the city. When so prepared and executed, they shall be delivered by the city auditor to the purchasers thereof, upon receipt of the purchase price plus interest accrued thereon to the date of the delivery of payment, or if so directed by resolution of the board of city commissioners, shall be delivered by the city auditor to the contractor for the sidewalk and curbing work for which such warrants are issued, in payment of estimates prepared by the
Title 10 22
city engineer and approved by the board of city commissioners of the cost of the work and materials theretofore performed and delivered. Purchasers of such warrants shall not be obligated to see to the application of the purchase price, but the proceeds of all such warrants shall be credited to the Construction Account and the Principal and Interest Account of the Sidewalk, Curb and Gutter Special Fund as hereinabove directed.
3. In the event that at any time the moneys in any of said Principal and Interest Account are insufficient to pay all principal and interest then due on warrants issued against such account, such moneys shall be first used to pay the accrued interest and the balance shall be applied in payment of principal, in order of maturity dates, and pro rata in payment of the principal amount of warrants maturing on the same date.
4. The officers of the city are hereby authorized to prepare and furnish to the purchaser or deliveree of any warrants issued against the Sidewalk, Curb and Gutter Special Fund certified copies of this ordinance and of the resolutions authorizing such warrants and of any other actions, proceedings or records of the city reasonably required to show the validity or marketability of said warrants, and all instruments so furnished shall be deemed to constitute representations of the City of Bismarck as to the correctness of all statements contained therein.

10-09-03. Creation of Zones. To carry out the provisions of this chapter certain zones are created which include all of the land lying within the instrument approach zones, non-instrument approach zones, transition zones, horizontal zone and conical zone. These areas and zones are shown on the airport zoning map consisting of one sheet, prepared by the city engineering department and dated March 5, 1979, which is made a part hereof, and on file in the offices of the city auditor and the city engineer. The various zones are established and defined as follows:
1. Instrument approach zone. An instrument approach zone is established at each end of the NW-SE instrument runway and at each end of the master planned NE-SW instrument runway, for the purpose of instrument landings and takeoffs. The instrument approach zones have a width of one thousand feet at a distance of two hundred feet beyond the ends of the runways, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand feet at a distance of fifty thousand two hundred feet beyond the ends of the runways, the center lines being the continuation of the center lines of the runways.
2. Non-instrument approach zones. A non-instrument approach zone is established at each end of all existing and master planned non-instrument runways for the purpose of non-instrument landings and takeoffs. The non-instrument approach zone of the NE-SW runway and the master planned NW-SE runway have a width of two hundred fifty feet at a distance of two hundred feet beyond each end of the runways, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of one thousand two hundred fifty feet at a distance of five thousand two hundred feet beyond each end of the runways, the center lines being the continuation of the center lines of the runways. The non-instrument approach zone of the N-S runway has a width of five hundred feet at a distance of two hundred feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of two thousand five hundred feet at a distance of ten thousand two hundred feet beyond each end of the runway, its center line being the continuation of the center line of the runway.
3. Transition zones. Transition zones are established adjacent to each existing and master planned instrument and non-instrument runway and approach zone as indicated on the zoning map. Transition zones symmetrically located on either side of the runways have variable widths as shown on the zoning map. Transition zones extend outward from a line one
Title 10 62
hundred twenty-five feet on either side of the center lines of the NE-SW and the master planned NW-SE non-instrument runways, and two hundred fifty feet on either side of the center line of the N-S non-instrument runway, for the length of the runways plus two hundred feet on each end, and are parallel and level with the runway center lines. Transition zones extend outward from a line five hundred feet on either side of the center line of the NW-SE and the master planned NE-SW instrument runways, for the length of the runways plus two hundred feet on each end, and are parallel and level with the runway center lines. The transition zones along the runways slope upward and outward one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the point where they intersect the surface of the horizontal zone. Further, transition zones are established adjacent to the instrument and non-instrument approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones. These transition zones have variable widths, as shown on the zoning map. The transition zones flare symmetrically with either side of the runway approach zones from the base of the zones and slope upward and outward at the rate of one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the points where they intersect the surfaces of the horizontal and conical zones. Additionally transition zones are established adjacent to the instrument approach zones where they project through and beyond the limits of the conical zone, extending a distance of five thousand feet measured horizontally from the edge of the instrument approach zones at right angles to the continuation of the center line of the runways.
4. Horizontal zone. A horizontal zone is established as the area contained within the following described boundary, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of ten thousand two hundred feet from each end of the NW-SE runway and the master planned NE-SW runway, and connecting the adjacent arcs of lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the instrument and non-instrument approach zones and the transition zones.
5. Conical zone. A conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a distance of four thousand feet. The conical zone does not include the instrument approach zones and transition zones.
10-09-04. Zone Height Limits.
Title 10 63
1. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a structure or tree may not be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any zone to a height in excess of the height limit established for the zone. The height limitations established for each of the zones are as follows:
a. Instrument approach zones. One foot in height for each fifty feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point two hundred feet from and at the elevation of the end of the runway extending to a distance of ten thousand two hundred feet from the end of the runway; thence one foot in height for each forty feet in horizontal distance to a point fifty thousand two hundred feet from the end of the runway.
b. Non-instrument approach zones. One foot in height for each forty feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point two hundred feet from and at the elevation of the end of the runway, extending to a point ten thousand two hundred feet from the end of the runway, said zones are established at the ends of the N-S non-instrument runway. One foot in height for each twenty feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point two hundred feet from and at the elevation of the end of the runway, extending to a point five thousand two hundred feet from the end of the runway.
c. Transition zones. One foot in height for each seven feet in horizontal distance beginning at any point one hundred twenty-five feet normal to and at the respective elevations of the center lines of the NE-SW non-instrument runway and the master planned NW-SE non-instrument runway and two hundred fifty feet normal to and at the elevation of the center line of the N-S non-instrument runway extending two hundred feet beyond each end, and five hundred feet normal to and at the respective elevations of the center lines of the NW-SE instrument runway, extending two hundred feet beyond each end extending to a height of one hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation which is one thousand six hundred sixty-three feet above mean sea level. In addition, there are established height limits of one foot vertical height for each seven feet horizontal distance measured from the edges of all approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones and extending upward and outward to the points where they intersect the horizontal
Title 10 64
or conical surfaces. Further, where the instrument approach zones project through and beyond the conical zone, a height limit of one foot for each seven feet of horizontal distance must be maintained beginning at the edge of the instrument approach zones and extending a distance of five thousand feet from the edge of the instrument approach zones measured normal to the center lines of the runways extended.
d. Horizontal zone. One hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation or a height of one thousand eight hundred thirteen feet above mean sea level.
e. Conical zone. One foot in height for each twenty feet horizontal distance beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone; extending to a height of three hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation.
2. Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation the more restrictive limitation prevails.
10-09-05. Use Restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, a use may not be made of the land within a zone established by this chapter in a manner which creates electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft, makes it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights and others, results in glare in the eyes of flyers using the airport, impairs visibility in the vicinity of the airport or otherwise endangers the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft.
10-09-06. Regulations Not Retroactive.
1. The provisions of this chapter are not retroactive as to any structure or tree not in conformity with these regulations on January 24, 1967, nor shall the regulations affect the continuance of the non-conformity.

Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit must be granted.
a. In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and the conical zone, a permit is not required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground, except when because of terrain, land contour or topographic features such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zone.

CHAPTER 10-11.1 CABLE SYSTEMS
10-11.1-01. Declaration of Findings. The Board of City Commissioners finds and declares that:
1. It is in the public interest to permit the use of rights-of-way and easements for the construction, maintenance, and operation of cable systems under the terms of this ordinance and a franchise.
2. It is in the public interest to ensure that a grantee does not unreasonably discriminate in whom they serve based on race, ethnic status, income, area in which they live, or other inappropriate basis, such as by not
Title 10 71
serving certain areas of the City, or failing on a timely basis to build their system to serve certain areas.
3. In order to meet community needs, cable systems need to be accessible throughout the City and need to be constructed with lines in appropriate places both to make available public, educational, and governmental access channels and to provide cable service to schools and government buildings.
4. Requiring providers to obtain a franchise prior to constructing such systems, while requiring the City to act expeditiously on any franchise request, allows the City to ensure that the City can properly manage and control rights-of-way use and that the preceding objectives and others which are in the public interest are met, while allowing the prompt provision of cable service.
5. It is the City’s intent to apply the ordinances of the City, including this ordinance to all persons who intend to offer video programming in the city and who intend in providing such video programming to use rights-of-way to construct or operate facilities comparable to a cable system, in a competitively neutral and non-discriminatory manner. All such persons shall be required to apply for a franchise before offering video programming in the City.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07)
10-11.1-02. Statement of Intent and Purpose. The City intends, by the adoption of this ordinance, to facilitate the development and operation of cable systems in the City. This type of development can contribute significantly to meeting the needs and desires of many individuals, associations, and institutions. Therefore, the following are statements of the City’s intent when granting or renewing a franchise:
1. Provide for the installation and operation of cable systems with features meeting the current and future cable-related needs and interests of the community considering the costs to subscribers and to a grantee.
2. To act expeditiously on any requests for a franchise so as to allow the prompt provision of cable service while ensuring that the public interest is met and that residents are not discriminated against based on race, ethnic status, income, area in which they live, or other inappropriate basis.
3. Encourage the widest feasible scope and diversity of programming and other cable services to all City residents that are consistent with community needs and
Title 10 72
interests and as measured against the cost of providing such programming and cable services.
4. Encourage prompt implementation of technical advances in communications technology.
5. Provide for ample and fairly allocated access to cable system facilities for program producers of public, educational, or governmental access programming consistent with the needs and interests of the community as measured against the cost of providing such programming.
6. Ensure that rates and charges for basic cable programming and equipment are fair, reasonable and consistent with federal standards.
7. Require that a grantee of a franchise provide customer service consistent with the standards of the FCC.
8. Ensure that the installation and maintenance of cable systems comply with all applicable City ordinances and regulations and do not interfere with the City’s legitimate use of rights-of-way and its own facilities and property.
9. Ensure that the occupants of the City’s rights-of-way protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry, public property and other uses of the rights-of-way.
10. Ensure universal availability of cable systems and video programming within City on a non-discriminatory basis.
11. Provide for timely mandatory government access to all cable systems in times of civil emergency consistent with any contractual obligations that any operator has with commercial broadcasters as permitted under applicable law.
12. Obtain compensation for the use of rights-of-way.

The terms and conditions of all new or renewed franchises granted after the date of this Ordinance shall be substantially similar in order that one grantee not be granted a competitive advantage over another. Nothing in this provision shall be construed in such a way as to limit the City's authority to enter into other franchises. In the event a person commences offering cable service or video programming without a franchise or is granted a franchise or permit to operate a cable system or an OVS system by the City, the terms and conditions of which do not comply with this ordinance shall be subject to review by a grantee for comparable application to its franchise. Any grantee shall have the right to petition the City for modifications to its franchise to ensure competitive equity and, in addition, to provide for any rights it may have to modify its franchise under state or federal law. The City shall work in good faith with a grantee to review and adopt modifications which the grantee deems necessary, and the review and approval by City shall not be unreasonably delayed or denied. A grantee is not a person that provides direct broadcast satellite services for purposes of this section.
7. It is the City’s intent to apply the ordinances of the City, including this ordinance to all persons who intend to offer video programming in City and who intend in providing such video programming to use rights-of-way to construct or operate facilities comparable to a cable system, in a competitively neutral and non-discriminatory manner. The City acknowledges that at the time of adoption of this ordinance, technology change is occurring in the delivery to subscribers of video programming. However, there are not clear guidelines from the FCC or other applicable legislative enactment defining local government authority. Notwithstanding this, and consistent with the City’s intentions, the City will evaluate change in technology and applicable law on its own motion, upon receipt of an application for a franchise or at the request of a grantee, and amend or modify this ordinance prior to granting a franchise to describe requirements of the City applicable to the use of City rights-of-way or to ensure competitive equity applicable to all persons intending to offer video programming to subscribers by facilities comparable to a cable system. A grantee is not a person
Title 10 82
that provides direct broadcast satellite services for purposes of this section. Notwithstanding any provisions of this section to the contrary, if the City does not possess authority under applicable laws to require a franchise from any person, the provisions of this section shall not apply.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07)

d. The City may consider any additional information that it deems applicable.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07)
10-11.1-07. Application for Franchise Renewal. Franchise renewals will be according to applicable law including the Cable Act, as amended. The City and grantee, by mutual consent, may enter into renewal negotiations at any time during the term of a franchise. The City will review and evaluate the requirements and conditions for renewal according to the Cable Act requirements and the requirements of Section 10-11.1-06.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07)
10-11.1-08. Permits for Non-Cable Services. The City may issue a license, easement, or other permit to a person other than a grantee to permit that person to traverse any portion of the City in order to provide services outside, but not within the City. Such license or easement, absent a grant of a franchise in accordance with this ordinance, shall not authorize nor permit said person to provide cable service of any type to any home or place of business within the City nor render any other service within the City.
Title 10 84
To the extent allowed by law, the City shall retain the authority to regulate and receive compensation for non-cable cable services. If a grantee is allowed by law and chooses to provide non-cable cable services, a grantee and the City will negotiate the terms and fees in accordance with applicable law.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07)
10-11.1-09. Franchise Provisions.
1. All franchises granted pursuant to this ordinance will be subject to this ordinance, applicable City ordinances and at least the following:

2. This ordinance and any franchise will be construed in a manner consistent with all valid applicable federal and state laws.
a. In the event that the state or federal government will discontinue preemption in any area of cable service or video programming over which it currently exercises jurisdiction in such a manner as to expand rather than limit municipal regulatory authority or otherwise change applicable law, the City may, if it so elects, make amendments or adopt rules and regulations in these areas to the extent permitted by law. Any rules and regulations adopted by the City will apply equally to all grantees and will be subject to Section 10-11.1-03(3).
b. This ordinance will apply to all franchises granted or renewed from and after the effective date of this ordinance.
c. A grantee will not be relieved of its obligation(s) to comply with any of the provisions of this ordinance or franchise granted pursuant to this ordinance by reason of any failure of the City to enforce prompt compliance.
3. Franchises shall be subject to the following:

Title 10 86
franchise shall be a binding contract. In addition, the franchise must contain the following express representations by a grantee that:
1. It accepts and agrees to all of the provisions of this ordinance, and any supplementary specification, as to construction, operation, or maintenance of the cable system, which the City may include in the franchise subject to valid applicable state and federal law.
2. It has examined all of the provisions of this ordinance and agrees that the provisions thereof are valid, binding at this time, and enforceable as of the effective date of the franchise.
3. A grantee recognizes the right of the City to adopt such additional regulations of general applicability as it will find necessary in the exercise of the City’s police power to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens; however, a grantee’s rights and duties pursuant to this ordinance and its franchise may not be materially altered or impaired without grantee’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
4. The franchise will contain such further conditions or provisions as are included in the applicant’s proposal and negotiated between the City and a grantee, except that no such conditions or provisions will be such as to conflict with any provisions of this ordinance or other valid applicable law. In case of such conflict or ambiguity between any terms or provisions of a franchise and this ordinance, the franchise will control.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07)
10-11.1-10. Conditions for Use of Rights-of-Way and Construction in the City.
1. Construction. A grantee shall comply with all applicable codes and ordinances of City with respect to construction within rights-of-way, including the City’s comprehensive set of construction specifications referred to as “Construction Standards for Municipal Public Works Improvements,” and shall obtain all necessary permits and licenses required there under or by other applicable law, ordinances and rules and as required of other like users of
Title 10 87
the rights-of-way, before commencing construction of a system in the City.

3. Aerial Installations and Poles. A grantee shall not erect, for any reason, any pole on or along any rights-of-way without the prior approval of the City.
4. Above-Ground Installations. Above-ground location of a system and related facilities shall generally be located where reasonable and safe and in a manner that will not unlawfully and adversely affect the City or other public or private property and shall be screened from public view upon request by the City if such requirements are made of like users of the rights-of-way.
5. City Use of Rights-of-Way. Nothing herein or in a franchise shall be construed to prevent the City from constructing sewers, grading, paving, repairing or altering any rights-of-way, or laying down, repairing or removing water mains or constructing or establishing any other public work. All such work shall be done in such manner as not to obstruct, injure or prevent the free use and operation of poles, wires, conduits, conductors, pipes or appurtenances of a grantee. If any facilities of a grantee interfere with the construction or repair of any public sidewalk, roadway, public utility or public facility or improvement, then the installation, facility or property of a grantee shall be removed or replaced as directed by the City so that the same shall not interfere with the public works of the City. Such removal, relocation or replacement shall be at the expense of a grantee. This section shall to apply to any facility which may compete with a grantee’s system or cable services.
6. Underground Installations. In those areas within the City where cable system facilities are currently placed underground, all cable system facilities shall remain or be placed underground. In areas where telephone or electric utility facilities are above ground or where occupied poles exist at the time of a grantee's installation, a grantee may install its cable system facilities above ground, provided that at such time as both electric and telephone utility facilities are placed underground, a grantee shall likewise place its cable system facilities underground without cost to the City. In no event shall a grantee be authorized to place above ground any facility that has
Title 10 88
previously been underground without prior approval from the City. Nothing contained in this section shall require a grantee to construct, operate and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances.
7. New Subdivisions. Subject to the line extension provisions of Section 10-11.1-12, a grantee shall provide cable services or video programming to residential development constructed or erected after the date of this ordinance. The developer or sub-divider developing any residential development within the City shall be required to notify all grantees of the filing of an application for a plat for a new subdivision to the City. A developer shall also be obligated to give at least fourteen (14) days advance written notice to a grantee of the beginning of excavation for or construction of off-site improvements in any residential development. All grantees shall then be required to install such conduit, pedestals, substructures and other equipment as may be necessary to provide cable service to the residential units in the development with minimal interference with surface improvements in the sole discretion of the individual grantee.
In cases of new construction or property development where utilities are to be placed underground, the developer or property owner shall give a grantee at least fourteen (14) days’ written notice of such construction or development, and of the particular date on which open trenching will be available for a grantee’s installation of conduit and/or facilities. Each grantee shall provide specifications as needed for trenching.
The cost of trenching and easements required to bring cable service to the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner; provided, however, if the developer has fully complied with its notice obligations to a grantee and that grantee fails to install its conduit and/or cable within thirty (30) working days of the date the trenches are available pursuant to notice given by the developer, and the trenches are closed after the thirty (30) day period, the cost of new trenching shall be borne by the grantee.
8. Moving Facilities. A grantee, on the request of the City, or any person holding a lawful permit issued by the City, or any permit issued by an appropriate state agency, shall temporarily move its wires, cables, poles or other cable system facilities to permit the moving of large objects, vehicles, buildings or other structures. The expense of such temporary moves shall be paid to a grantee by the person requesting the same and a grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. In no
Title 10 89
event shall City pay such expense. A grantee shall be given not less than ten (10) business days advance notice to arrange for such temporary moves.
9. Property Damage and Repair. Whenever a grantee disturbs or damages any rights-of-way, other public property or any private property, a grantee shall promptly restore the property to at least its prior condition, normal wear and tear excepted, at its own expense. In addition, if a grantee is restoring rights-of-way, it shall do so in accordance with all applicable requirements. A grantee shall warrant any restoration work performed by or for a grantee for one (1) year. If restoration is not satisfactorily performed by a grantee within a reasonable time, the City may, after thirty (30) days prior notice to a grantee, or without notice where the disturbance or damage creates a risk to public health or safety, cause the repairs to be made and recover the out-of-pocket costs of those repairs from a grantee. A grantee shall reimburse the City within thirty (30) days of receipt of an itemized list of those costs.
10. Work Performed by Others. A grantee shall make available to the City the names and addresses of any person, other than a grantee, which performs work on behalf of a grantee pursuant to a franchise. All provisions of this ordinance and a franchise remain the responsibility of a grantee. All provisions of a franchise shall apply to any of a grantee's subcontractors or others performing any work or service pursuant to the provisions of a franchise. A grantee shall be responsible for and hold the City harmless for any claims or liability arising out of work performed by persons other than a grantee. A grantee shall provide the City with emergency contact information (name, address, phone number, etc.) for said entity.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07)
10-11.1-11. Service Areas and Technical Standards.
1. Geographical Coverage. A grantee shall design its cable system or system providing video programming, and construct and maintain it to pass every dwelling unit within the service area, subject to the extension provisions in this section. Further, as provided in the cable act, a grantee shall have a reasonable amount of time to complete construction and as may otherwise be provided in a franchise. A grantee shall maintain a map of its entire system and this map will be annually updated by a grantee and provided to the City upon request to show extensions of the system throughout the service area.
2. Required Extensions of the Cable System. Whenever a grantee receives a request for cable service
Title 10 90
from a subscriber in a contiguous un-served area within the City where there are at least ten (10) residences within one thousand three hundred and twenty (1,320) cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable mile) from the tap or node of a grantee’s trunk or distribution cable from which it is to be extended as designated by the grantee, it shall extend its cable system to such subscribers at no cost to said subscribers for the cable system extension, other than the published standard/non-standard installation fees charged to all subscribers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a grantee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to extend the cable system into any portion of the service area where another operator is providing cable service, into any annexed area which is not contiguous to the present service area of a grantee, or into any area which is financially or technically infeasible due to extraordinary circumstances, such as a runway or freeway crossing.
3. Subscriber Charges for Extensions of the Cable System. No subscriber shall be refused cable service arbitrarily. However, if an area does not meet the density requirements of paragraph 2 above, a grantee shall only be required to extend the cable system to subscriber(s) in that area if the subscriber(s) are willing to share the capital costs of extending the cable system. A grantee may require that payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance. Subscribers shall also be responsible for any non-standard installation charges to extend the cable system from the tap or node as designated by the grantee to the residence.
4. Technical Standards. A grantee is responsible for insuring that the cable system is designed, installed and operated in a manner that fully complies with FCC rules
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07; Ord. 6334, 06-12-18)
10-11.1-12. Emergency Use.
1. In accordance with and at the time required by the provisions of FCC Regulations Part 11, Subpart D, Section 11.51, and as other provisions which may from time to time be amended, a grantee shall install, if it has not already done so, and maintain an Emergency Alert System (EAS) for use in transmitting Emergency Act Notifications (EAN) and Emergency Act Terminations (EAT) in local and state-wide situations as may be designated to be an emergency by the Local Primary (LP), the State Primary (SP) and/or the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC), as those authorities are identified and defined within FCC Regulations, Section 11.18.
Title 10 91
2. The City shall permit only appropriately trained and authorized persons to operate the EAS equipment and take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of a grantee’s cable system in any manner that results in inappropriate use, or any loss or damage to the cable system. Except to the extent expressly prohibited by law, the City agrees to hold a grantee, its employees, officers and assigns harmless from any claims arising out of the emergency use of its facilities by the City, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07)
10-11.1-13. Public, Educational and Government Access Channels.
1. Every grantee shall, to the extent required in its franchise agreement and subject to this ordinance and applicable law, provide channels, funds, facilities, and equipment as described in a franchise agreement. Further, such requirements shall, at a minimum, satisfy the community needs as determined by the City for the period of the applicable franchise agreement. Additional franchises awarded by City shall have equivalent requirements.
2. All such public, educational and government access channels shall be available to all subscribers as part of their basic cable. Given the on-going changes in the state of technology as of the effective date of this ordinance, absent express written consent of the City, grantee shall transmit at least three public, educational and government access channels in the format or technology utilized to transmit all of the channels on basic cable. Oversight and administration of the educational and government access channels shall be set forth in the franchise agreement.
3. Every grantee shall, in good faith and with reasonable efforts, ensure that the transmission of public, educational and governmental access programming and channel designations between systems within City can be accomplished in a reasonable and cost-effective manner through interconnection.
4. Every grantee shall ensure that an access plan made part of a franchise agreement shall include provisions regarding program origination from sites identified and agreed to between City and a grantee, which may be the same or different than additional grantee’s, but the obligation for this commitment shall be comparable.
5. Grantees, by acceptance of a franchise, agree that on the effective date of its franchise, the PEG access channels on the basic cable service activated and used by
Title 10 92
the City will have the same channel designations as other grantees.
6. Unless permitted by applicable law, a grantee may not change PEG access channel designations on the basic cable service without City approval during the term of a franchise except to the extent such channel designations are changed by other grantees as approved by City.
7. The use of PEG access channels by City or its designee, DMA, shall be in accordance with and subject to the rules and procedures adopted by the City or its designee, DMA, and as authorized under the Cable Act.
8. A grantee shall include access channels in all cable services packages.
9. Access channels shall be for non-commercial use, except for programming sponsorship acknowledgements or for-credit courses offered by North Dakota accredited educational institutions located in the City.
10. A grantee shall insure that all access channels meet the technical standards of the FCC; provided, however, a grantee shall not be responsible for defects, flaws or other impairments in the PEG access programming delivered to a grantee and shall only be responsible for maintenance up to the location agreed to with City.
11. If grantee makes changes to its cable system that necessitate modifications to access signal transmission facilities and equipment (including but not limited to the upstream paths), a grantee shall provide reasonable advance notice of such changes to the City and shall provide, at a grantee’s expense, any additional or modified headend facilities necessary to implement such modifications within a reasonable period of time prior to the date that the system changes are to be made.
12. Upon request by the City, the access channels shall be made available in any new formats comparable to commercial offerings at the time a grantee converts its system to digital transmission.
13. The City may require all grantees to provide financial support permissible under the Cable Act, as a grant payable by each grantee to the City or its designee for any lawful purpose for development of PEG Access Programming in the amount of up to two percent (2%) of each grantee’s Gross Revenue, as determined by City no more frequently than once every two (2) years. The grant shall be payable by each grantee with the Franchise Fee payment
Title 10 93
as required by this Ordinance and shall be itemized and passed through to the Subscribers, in the same manner. The City shall impose the same percentage fee on all grantees or shall not impose said fee on any grantee.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07; Ord. 6334, 06-12-18)
10-11.1-14. Cable Service to Public Buildings. A grantee, upon request, shall provide a standard installation and one (1) outlet and free basic cable to those administrative buildings owned and occupied by the City, library(ies) fire station(s), police station(s) and K-12 public and private school(s) that are within four hundred (400) feet of its cable system at the Grantee’s lowest non-subsidized residential rate. The City shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of a grantee’s cable system in any manner that results in the inappropriate use thereof or any loss or damage to the cable operator. The City shall hold a grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of the provision and use of cable service and/or the cable system required by this subsection. A grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where a non-standard installation is required, unless the City or building owner/occupant agrees to pay the incremental cost of any necessary cable system extension and/or non-standard installation. If additional outlets of basic cable are provided to such buildings, the building owner/occupant shall pay the actual cost associated therewith.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07; Ord. 6334, 06-12-18)
10-11.1-15. Institutional Network and Services to Public, Governmental, and Educational Locations. Repealed June 12, 2018.

10-11.1-16. Broad Categories of Programs and Services. Consistent with federal law, a grantee shall provide or enable the provision of broad categories of programming to the extent such categories are reasonably available on commercially reasonable terms.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07; Ord. 06-12-18)
10-11.1-17. Periodic Evaluation. The field of video communications is rapidly changing and may see many regulatory, technical, financial, marketing, and legal changes during the term of a franchise. Therefore, in order to provide for a maximum degree of flexibility in this ordinance and a franchise, and to help achieve continued advanced and modern cable systems serving the City that meet the needs of the City, the following evaluation provisions shall apply:
1. Subject to the provisions of this section and upon thirty (30) days written notice to a grantee, the City may require an evaluation session. The evaluation session may occur no sooner than the fifth (5th) anniversary date
Title 10 94
of a grantee’s franchise. Such evaluation shall determine if it is appropriate to amend this ordinance and/or a franchise to address developments in the field of video communications that may have taken place over the course of time. Any proposed amendment of the franchise under this section shall be based upon the reasonable cable needs and related needs and interests of the City and subscribers and take into consideration the costs to a grantee of meeting those needs and interests. The City and a grantee shall negotiate amendments to the franchise in good faith.
2. All evaluation sessions shall be open to the public and notice of sessions published in the same way as the City publishes other legal notices.
3. Topics which may be discussed at any evaluation session may include, but are not limited to, application of new technologies, a grantee’s performance, programming offered, access channels, facilities and support, municipal uses of cable, customer complaints, amendments to this ordinance and a franchise, judicial rulings, FCC rulings, line extension policies, and any other topics City and a grantee deem relevant.
4. Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, the City and a grantee may at any time amend the franchise by mutual consent.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07)
10-11.1-18. Regulation by the City.
1. City’s Transfer of Functions. The City may delegate its obligations and duties under this ordinance and a franchise to any elected official, officer, employee, department, agent or board of the City to the extent permitted by law, and a grantee shall recognize the authority of any such delegate provided, however, that the City Commission shall retain the sole authority to take enforcement action pursuant to this ordinance and a franchise. The City shall provide a grantee with written notices of any such delegation or transfer of functions.
2. City’s Right of Inspection. The City may inspect all construction or installation work performed pursuant to a franchise granted under this ordinance in order to ensure compliance with the terms of the franchise grant, as well as all applicable statutes and ordinances.
3. Franchise Fee.
a. A grantee shall pay to the City a franchise fee of five percent (5%) of annual gross revenue. In accordance with the Cable Act, the twelve (12) month
Title 10 95
period applicable under the franchise for the computation of the franchise fee shall be a calendar year. The franchise fee payment shall be due monthly and payable within thirty (30) days after the close of the preceding month. Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief report prepared by a representative of a grantee showing the basis for the computation. Should a grantee have the ability to do so and at the direction of the City, payments shall be deposited to a City account electronically.
In the event that the Franchise Fee in Paragraph 2.8 is preempted and all appellate or other legal reviews have been concluded, the City may establish and apply to Grantee an alternative per linear foot rental charge for Grantee's use of the Rights-of-Way. If the City is then applying a linear foot charge to any "Similar User" of the Rights of-Way, the City shall apply to Grantee a linear foot charge at the rate per linear foot that it is charging any Similar User. A "Similar User" shall mean any entity or company that· occupies the Rights-of-Way and offers services similar to those that Grantee offers. The City shall apply the rate per linear foot thus determined to the actual linear feet of cables, wires or other devices that Grantee is occupying in the Rights-of-Way in the year at issue. If no Similar User exists at the time that the City establishes a linear foot charge for Grantee, the City shall determine Grantee's charge by reference to the revenues that the City received, or should have received, in the previous twelve months from Grantee. For example, if the City should have received Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00) from Grantee for the prior twelve (12) month period and Grantee's facilities occupied thirty thousand (30,000) linear feet of Rights-of-Way during that period, Grantee's rate per linear foot will be Two Dollars ($2.00) ($60,000/30,000). The rate of Two Dollars ($2.00) will then be applied in each subsequent year to the number of linear feet that Grantee's facilities occupy in the Rights-of-Way that year. If the City determines by audit that the revenues that it received in the base period were incorrect, the City shall make appropriate adjustments, both retroactively and prospectively.
Should the above-described linear foot rental charge be declared invalid by a court or other body of competent jurisdiction, or in any way be preempted, relieving the Grantee of the obligation to pay the linear foot rental charge, the City shall establish a further alternative reasonable rental charge or other appropriate method of compensation. Any such further
Title 10 96
rental charge shall be comparable to payments Grantee would otherwise have been obligated to pay to the City under Paragraph 2.1A. No such further alternative rental charge shall be established without a public hearing with notice to Grantee of such hearing not less than thirty (30) days prior to the public hearing.
Where Grantee bundles, integrates, ties, or combines Cable Service with other services in a bundled package for which Subscribers pay a single fee, Gross Revenues for such bundled, integrated, or tied combination of services shall be determined based on the pricing for individual components billed or advertised to Subscribers by Grantee or, if such pricing for individual components is not provided by Grantee, based on a pro rata allocation among the services offered. Grantee shall not use bundled package offerings as a means of evading the payment of financial obligations that are based on Cable Service revenue.
b. The period of limitation for recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be three (3) years from the date on which payment by a grantee is due.
c. All amounts due and owing under this ordinance and a franchise and not paid by the dates specified herein shall bear interest at the prime rate listed in the Wall Street Journal on the date payment was due and compounded daily and calculated daily from the date due until the date of actual payment.
d. The franchise fee obligation herein is a material requirement of a franchise and is considered payment by a grantee for use of rights-of-way.
4. Accounting Standards. Within Forty-five (45) days of the end of each calendar year, a grantee shall file with the City a report, certified by a certified public accountant, an officer or a director of a grantee, showing the previous year’s gross revenues from subscribers and the applicable franchise fee payments as defined within the Ordinance.
5. Auditing and Financial Records. A grantee and the City shall make good faith efforts to work together to prescribe reasonable standards governing the nature, extent, and type of accounting system and accounting procedures utilized by a grantee for the purposes of promoting the efficient administration of the franchise fee
Title 10 97
requirement of this franchise and which are consistent general accounting standards.
A grantee agrees, by acceptance of a franchise, that the City, upon thirty (30) days written notice to a grantee, may during the term of a franchise, but not more frequently than once each year, conduct an audit of the books, records, and accounts of a grantee for the purpose of determining whether a grantee has paid franchise fees in the amounts prescribed herein. Such notice shall specifically reference the section of this ordinance and/or the franchise to be reviewed, so that a grantee may organize the necessary books and records for easy access by the City. The audit may be conducted by the City or by an independent certified public accounting firm retained by the City and shall be conducted at the sole expense of the City. The party conducting the audit shall prepare a written report containing its findings and the report shall be filed with the City and mailed to the City and grantee. A grantee shall make available for inspection by authorized representatives of the City, its books, accounts and all other financial records at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice for the purpose of permitting exercise of the authorities conferred by this section. A grantee shall not be required to maintain any books or records for franchise compliance purposes longer than three (3) years. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and subject to the requirements of North Dakota’s Government Records Management Act (GRAMA), grantee shall not be required to disclose information that it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature, nor disclose books and records of any affiliate that is not providing cable service in the service area. The City agrees to treat any information disclosed by a grantee as confidential and only to disclose it to employees, representatives, and agents thereof that have a need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof. A grantee shall not be required to provide subscriber information in violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act.
6. Rates and Charges. The City may regulate rates for the provision of basic cable and equipment as expressly permitted by federal or state law.
7. Renewal of Franchise.
a. Any proceedings undertaken by the City that relate to the renewal of a grantee's franchise shall be governed by and comply with the provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act, as amended.
Title 10 98
b. In addition to the procedures set forth in said Section 626(a), the City agrees to notify a grantee of all of its assessments regarding the identity of future cable-related community needs and interests, as well as the past performance of a grantee under the then current franchise term. The City further agrees that such assessments shall be provided to a grantee promptly so that a grantee has adequate time to submit a proposal under Section 626(b) of the Cable Act and complete renewal of the franchise prior to expiration of its term.
c. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 8-11.1-18, a grantee and the City understand that at any time during the term of the then current franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and opportunity to comment, the City and a grantee may agree to undertake and finalize informal negotiations regarding renewal of the then current franchise and the City may grant a renewal thereof.
d. A grantee and the City consider the terms set forth in this section to be consistent with the express provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act.
8. Conditions of Sale. If a renewal or extension of a grantee's franchise is denied or the franchise is lawfully terminated, and the City either lawfully acquires ownership of the cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at the price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 627 of the Cable Act and after a grantee has had the opportunity to effectuate a lawful transfer of its system to a qualified third party pursuant to this section.
A grantee and the City will understand and agree that in the case of a final determination of a lawful revocation, termination or non-renewal of a franchise, a grantee shall be given at least twelve (12) months to effectuate a transfer of its cable system to a qualified third party, approval for which by the City shall not be unreasonably withheld. Furthermore, a grantee shall be authorized to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise during this period. If, at the end of that time, a grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its cable system which is reasonably acceptable to the City, a grantee and the City may avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to federal or state law. It is further agreed
Title 10 99
that a grantee's continued operation of the cable system during the twelve (12) month period shall not be deemed to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment of, any rights of either the City or a grantee.
9. Transfer of Franchise. A grantee's right, title, or interest in the franchise shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered, other than to an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a grantee, without the prior consent of the City, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. No such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of a grantee in the franchise or cable system in order to secure indebtedness. Within thirty (30) days of receiving a request for transfer, the City shall notify a grantee in writing of any additional information it reasonably requires to determine the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee. If the City has not taken action on a grantee's request for transfer within one hundred twenty (120) days after receiving such request, consent by the City shall be deemed given.

10-11.1-19. Customer Practices.
1. No Discrimination. A grantee shall not, as to rates, charges, make or grant any preference or advantage to any person, nor subject any person to any prejudice or disadvantage. This section shall not be construed to prohibit promotional or bulk discounts, or discounts that may be made available to seniors or the economically disadvantaged.
Neither a grantee nor any of its employees, agents, representatives, contractors, subcontractors, or consultants, nor any other person, shall discriminate or permit discrimination between or among any persons in the availability of cable services provided in connection with a cable system in the City. It shall be the right of all persons to receive all available cable services provided on cable systems so long as such person’s financial or other obligations to a grantee are satisfied
2. Subscriber Privacy. A grantee agrees to comply with the provisions of Section 631 of the Cable Act.
3. Notice to Subscriber. A grantee shall provide written notices to those subscribers notifying them of their privacy rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 631 of the Cable Act.
Title 10 100
4. Grantee Rules, Regulations. A grantee shall have authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms and conditions as it deems necessary in order to operate the franchise granted under this ordinance. Copies of all rules, regulations, terms and conditions including subscriber agreements together with any amendments, additions or deletions thereto, shall be made available to the City.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07)
10-11.1-20. Customer Service Standards.
1. A grantee shall comply with the customer service standards of the FCC.
2. Subject to the privacy provisions of 47 U.S.C. § 521 et. seq., every grantee shall prepare as necessary and maintain records of complaints made to them and the resolution of such complaints, including the date of such resolution. For the purposes of this requirement, all complaints or cable service calls that result in the dispatch of a cable service technician shall be individually logged and for all other complaints a grantee may satisfy this requirement by the creation of a periodic written summary of the type of complaint and their resolution. Such complaint logs and summaries shall be on file at the office of a grantee for three (3) years, and available for inspection by the City upon request.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07)
10-11.1-21. Annual Reports and Records of Grantee.
1. Annual Reports Required. Upon request a grantee shall make available to the City the following annual reports not later than ninety (90) days after the request is made.
a. Any publicly available reports or documents which a grantee must file with a government agency that specifically address a grantee’s obligation under a franchise shall be provided to City, excepting federal and state income tax returns and forms, and such reports not required to be filed based on the federal Securities Act.
b. A copy of the publicly available consolidated report to its stockholders issued at the end of a grantee’s fiscal year rendered by a grantee’s parent grantee for all of its operations, if such a report exists.
c. A copy of its annual reports to the FCC as well as a copy of such annual report made to any state
Title 10 101
agency which in the future may regulate such system, if such a report exists.
2. Records.
a. The City shall have the right to inspect, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, any records maintained by a grantee which relate to cable system operations including specifically a grantee's accounting and financial records; provided, however, a grantee may withhold records it deems to be confidential and proprietary until the parties execute a nondisclosure agreement consistent with applicable law. A grantee shall produce such books and records for City's inspection at a grantee's local office or at another mutually agreed upon location.
b. The City acknowledges that some of the records, including maps and facility location information, that may be provided by a grantee may be considered confidential by a grantee and therefore may subject a grantee to competitive disadvantage if made public. The City will maintain the confidentiality of any records provided to it by a grantee that are identified by grantee in writing as “confidential” (“confidential information”).
Upon receipt of demand from any third party for disclosure of records pursuant to applicable law, the City shall advise a grantee and provide a grantee with a copy of any written request by the party demanding access to such records, if available, prior to the proposed release. The City agrees that, to the extent permitted by state and federal law, it shall deny access to any of a grantee’s books and records marked confidential as set forth above. If the City is compelled to disclose any of a grantee’s confidential information pursuant to applicable federal or state laws, rules, regulations, or court orders or subpoenas (each a “Requirement”), the City shall provide the grantee with prompt notice of any such requirement and shall cooperate with the grantee, at the grantee’s sole expense, in seeking to obtain any protective order or other arrangement pursuant to which the confidentiality of the grantee’s confidential information is preserved. If such an order or arrangement is not obtained, the City shall disclose only that portion of the grantee’s confidential information as is required pursuant to such requirement. Any such required disclosure shall not, in and of itself, change the status of the disclosed information as the grantee’s confidential information. Subject to the City’s compliance with this section, the City shall not be liable
Title 10 102
to a grantee for any submission or disclosure of such information to a third party as required by applicable law or to a government agency or regulatory body seeking the records and claiming jurisdiction in any of these events. Nothing in this section shall limit the right of a grantee to contest disclosure or submission to a third party as required by law or to a government agency or regulatory body asserting jurisdiction over it or such subject matter before such disclosure shall be effected. A grantee shall reimburse the City for all reasonable costs and attorneys fees incurred in any legal proceedings pursued under this section.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07)
10-11.1-22. Insurance and Indemnification.
1. Indemnification Against Liability. A grantee agrees by acceptance of a franchise that it shall indemnify and save free and harmless, and by the acceptance of a franchise, agrees to indemnify and save free and harmless the City, the City Commission, each member thereof, all officers, agents, employees and members of boards and commissions of the City from and against any and all liability by reason of or arising out of any and all claims, demands, causes of action or proceedings which may be asserted, prosecuted or established against them or any of them, for damage to persons or property of whatever nature arising out of the use by a grantee of the rights-of-way, or of any other operations or activities of a grantee pursuant to this ordinance and a franchise and the operation of a cable operator, whether such damage shall be caused by negligence or otherwise (including but not limited to any liability for damages for defamation and damages by reason of or arising out of any failure by a grantee to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors or licensees of programs to be delivered by a grantee’s cable operator or vehicle operations) and irrespective of the amount of the liability insurance policies required hereunder, but excepting there from liability arising out of any claim, demand, cause of action or proceeding resulting from the negligence or willful misconduct of the City, the City Commission, each member thereof, or officers, agents, employees or members of boards and commissions of the City, or resulting from the negligence or willful misconduct of persons distributing programs via the access channels over which persons and programming a grantee cannot legally and does not exercise control.
2. Duty to Defend. A grantee, by the acceptance of a franchise, agrees to defend at its own cost and expense the City, the City Commission each member thereof, all officers, agents, employees and members of board and
Title 10 103
commissions of the City against any and all claims, demands, actions or proceedings brought against them or any of them, in respect to the matters embraced by the indemnity set forth herein.
3. General Comprehensive Liability Insurance Policy. Concurrently with the filing of the acceptance of award of a franchise, a grantee shall furnish to the City and at all times during the existence of franchise shall maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and expense, a commercial general liability insurance policy and in a form reasonably satisfactory to the city. Said policy shall include, but shall not be limited to, personal injury, broad form property damage, blanket contractual, completed operations, underground hazard, explosion and collapse hazard, independent contractors, vaults, and products liability insurance. Said policy shall insure a grantee, the City, the City Commission, each member thereof, all officers, agents, employees and members of board or commissions of the City against liability for all matters embraced herein, with minimum combined single liability limit of two million dollars ($2,000,000).
4. Workers’ Compensation Insurance. A Grantee will obtain and maintain workers’ compensation insurance for all grantee’s employees, and in case any work is sublet, a grantee will require any subcontractor similarly to provide workers’ compensation insurance for all subcontractors' employees, in compliance with state laws, and to fully protect the City from any and all claims arising out of work-related occurrences. A grantee, by acceptance of a franchise, thereby agrees it indemnifies City for any damage resulting to it from failure of either a grantee or any subcontractor to obtain and maintain such insurance. A grantee will provide the City with a certificate of insurance indicating workers’ compensation insurance prior to operations under a franchise and the commencement of any construction, system upgrade, reconstruction, or maintenance of a System. The certificate of insurance must confirm that the required endorsements are in effect.
5. Additional Insured, Primary Coverage and Defense. The policies of insurance shall contain an additional insured clause providing that City, the City Commission, each member thereof, all officers, agents, employees and members of boards and commissions of the City shall be named as an additional insured under said policy. Each such policy required above shall provide that it is to be considered primary insurance in the event a demand is made on the City. Each policy required above shall contain a provision by the insurer to perform the covenant for defense set forth herein.
Title 10 104
6. Notice. Each of the above-listed policies of insurance shall contain a provision that a written notice of cancellation or reduction in coverage shall be delivered to the City Administrator thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date thereof. If such insurance is provided by a policy which also covers any other entity or person other than those above-named, then such policy shall contain the standard cross-liability enforcement. A grantee will not cancel or reduce said insurance coverage without the City having been given thirty (30) days prior written notice thereof by a grantee.
7. Filing of Certified Copy with City. A certificate of insurance coverage shall be filed in the office of the City Administrator concurrently upon the acceptance of the award of a franchise and shall be updated annually if any changes to the policies occur.
8. Subrogation. Any insurance policies procured by a grantee pursuant to this ordinance and a franchise shall provide that the insurance carrier waives all rights of subrogation against the City.
9. Third Parties. A grantee shall be liable for the acts of its third parties (contractors and subcontractors) and ensure that before commencement of work regarding construction, operation, and maintenance of its cable system, any such third parties have provided insurance in compliance with this Section.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07)
10-11.1-23. Enforcement and Termination of Franchise.
1. Security Fund.
a. Except as expressly provided herein, a grantee shall not be required to obtain or maintain bonds or other surety as a condition of being awarded a franchise or continuing its existence. The City shall determine whether or not a bond or surety is required based upon a review of an applicant’s or a grantee’s legal, financial, and technical qualifications and shall establish such requirement in the franchise. If the qualifications of a grantee are sufficient for compliance with the terms of this ordinance and a franchise and the enforcement thereof the City may waive any requirement for a bond or surety. In the event that a bond or other surety is required in the future, the City agrees to give a grantee at least sixty (60) days prior written notice thereof stating the amount and the reason for the requirement. The City agrees that in no event,
Title 10 105
however, shall it require a bond or other related surety in an aggregate amount greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000).
b. If a bond or other surety has been established, the security fund may be drawn on by City for those purposes specified.
c. Within thirty (30) days after notice to a grantee that any amount has been withdrawn by the City from the bond or other surety, a grantee shall deposit a sum of money or otherwise replace the bond or other surety in a manner sufficient to restore such bond or other surety to its original amount.
d. Nothing herein will be deemed a waiver of the normal permit and bonding requirements made of all contractors working within the City’s rights-of-way, except as may be waived in accordance with a franchise.
2. Procedure for Remedying Franchise Violations. If a grantee fails to perform in a timely manner any material obligation as determined by the City to be required herein, following notice from the City and an opportunity to cure such non-performance, the City may remedy such violation in accordance with the following procedures:
a. The City will first notify a grantee of the violation in writing by delivery of registered or certified mail, and demand correction within a reasonable time. A grantee shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice to: (a) respond to the City, contesting the assertion of non-compliance, which shall toll the running of any timeframes hereunder until a grantee is afforded the public hearing required herein and a written determination of the City Commission has been issued, or (b) cure such default, or (c) in the event that, by the nature of default, such default cannot be cured within the thirty (30) day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the City of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed. If a grantee fails to correct the violation within the time prescribed or if grantee fails to commence corrective action within the time prescribed and diligently remedy such violation thereafter, a grantee will then be given thirty (30) days prior written notice of a public hearing to be held before the City Commission. Said notice will specify the violations alleged to have occurred.
Title 10 106
b. At the public hearing, the City Commission will hear and consider all relevant evidence, and thereafter render findings and its decision. Such public hearing shall be held at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the City which is scheduled at a time which is no less than five business days there from. The City shall notify a grantee in writing of the time and place of such meeting and provide a grantee with an opportunity to be heard.
c. In the event the City Commission finds that a grantee has corrected the violation or has diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from the City and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy such violation, or that no material violation has occurred, the proceedings will terminate and no penalty or other sanction will be imposed.
d. Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event the City Commission finds that a material violation exists and that a grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or has not diligently commenced correction of such violation, the City Commission may establish a date, no earlier than thirty (30) days following notification, by which grantee must comply with the obligation or the City may thereafter seek specific performance of any franchise provision, which reasonably lends itself to such remedy. In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the franchise, the City Commission may also implement the franchise termination procedures in accordance with the following:
1. The City shall give written notice to a grantee of its intent to revoke a franchise on the basis of a pattern of non-compliance by a grantee, including one or more instances of substantial non-compliance with a material provision of the franchise. The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the non-compliance. A grantee shall have ninety (90) days from such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the City has not received a satisfactory response from a grantee, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a public meeting. City shall cause to be served upon a grantee, at least ten (10) days prior to such public meeting, a written notice specifying the time and place of such
Title 10 107
meeting and stating its intent to request such termination.
2. At the designated meeting, the City shall give a grantee an opportunity to state its position on the matter, after which it shall determine whether or not a franchise shall be revoked. A grantee may appeal such determination to an appropriate court. Such appeal to the appropriate court must be taken within sixty (60) days of the issuance of the determination of the City.
3. The City may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it deems appropriate to enforce the City's rights under a franchise in lieu of revocation of a franchise.
e. In determining whether a violation is material, the City will take into consideration the reliability of the evidence of the violation, the nature of the violation, and the damage, if any, caused to the City or the City’s residents thereby, whether the violation was chronic, and any justifying or mitigating circumstances, and such other matters as the City may deem appropriate. The parties hereby agree that it is not the City’s intention to subject a grantee to penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of a franchise for so-called “technical” breach(es) or violation(s) of a franchise or local cable ordinance, which shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. In instances or for matters where a violation or a breach by a grantee of a franchise or local cable ordinance was good faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative impact on the customers within the service area.
2. Where there existed circumstances reasonably beyond the control of a grantee and which precipitated a violation by a grantee of a franchise or local cable ordinance, or which were deemed to have prevented a grantee from complying with a term or condition of the franchise or local cable ordinance.
3. Penalty. In the event, after complying with the due process procedures provided herein, the City finds that a material violation exists and that a grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or has not diligently commenced correction of such violation, the City
Title 10 108
may establish a date, no earlier than thirty (30) days following notification, by which a grantee must comply with the obligation or the City may thereafter impose damages, payable from the security fund.
4. Revocation. Should the City seek to revoke a franchise after following the procedures set forth above, the City shall give written notice to a grantee of its intent. The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the non-compliance. A grantee shall have ninety (90) days from such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the City has not received a satisfactory response from a grantee, it may then seek termination of a franchise at a public hearing. The City shall cause to be served upon a grantee, at least thirty (30) days prior to such public hearing, a written notice specifying the time and place of such hearing and stating its intent to revoke a franchise.
At the designated hearing, the City shall give a grantee an opportunity to state its position on the matter, after which it shall determine whether or not the franchise shall be revoked. A grantee may appeal such determination to an appropriate court. Such appeal to the appropriate court must be taken within sixty (60) days of the issuance of the determination of the City.
5. City’s Rights to Enforce. The City may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it deems appropriate to enforce a franchise and the exercise of any of the remedies as set forth herein shall not constitute an election of remedies or otherwise be considered a waiver by the City to take any lawful action or exercise any appropriate remedy it deems appropriate to enforce the terms and conditions of this ordinance and a franchise.
6. Removal or Abandonment of Property. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary of this section, upon termination of a franchise, a grantee or its successors and assigns shall retain ownership of the cable system and shall be entitled at its option and expense to remove the cable system from all rights-of-ways, private property, or to abandon said cable system. Should a grantee elect to remove the cable system, it is obligated to restore all property to its prior condition. If a grantee fails to restore the property satisfactorily, the City may complete the work and a grantee shall reimburse the City within ninety (90) days of receipt of an itemized bill for such work.
7. Force Majeure. A grantee shall not be held in default under, or in non-compliance with, the provisions of
Title 10 109
this ordinance or a franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to non-compliance or default, where such non-compliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the ability of a grantee to anticipate and control. This provision includes work delays caused by waiting for utility providers to service or monitor their utility poles to which a grantee’s cable system is attached, as well as unavailability of materials and/or qualified labor to perform the work necessary.
Furthermore, the parties hereby agree that it is not the City’s intention to subject a grantee to penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of the franchise for violations of this ordinance or the franchise where the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative impact on the subscribers within the service area, or where strict performance would result in practical difficulties and hardship to a grantee which outweigh the benefit to be derived by the City and/or subscribers.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07)
10-11.1-24. Miscellaneous Provisions.
1. Compliance with Laws. A grantee and the City shall act reasonably and in good faith, deal fairly, and cooperate with each other to enable performance of all obligations under this ordinance and achievements of the expected benefits.
2. Compliance with Federal, State and Local Laws.
a. If any federal, state or local law or regulation requires or permits a grantee or the City to perform any service or act or shall prohibit a grantee or the City from performing any service or act which may be in conflict with the terms of a franchise, then as soon as possible following knowledge thereof, City and a grantee shall notify the other of the point of conflict believed to exist between such law or regulation.
b. Severability. If any section, sentence, clause or phrase of this ordinance or a franchise is for any reason held to be invalid, unenforceable or unconstitutional by a decision of any authority or court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this ordinance or a franchise and the remainder shall remain in full force and effect.
Title 10 110
3. Non-enforcement by City. A grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this ordinance or a franchise by reason of any failure of City to enforce prompt compliance.
4. Direct Sales Allowed in City. A grantee shall be allowed to utilize a door-to-door sales force to market its cable service in the City in compliance with Chapter 5-07.
(Ord. 5647, 11-27-07)

CHAPTER 10-13. EMINENT DOMAIN
10-13-01. Eminent Domain; Quick Take.

CHAPTER 11-03. WATER AND SEWER UTILITIES
11-03-01. Utility Creation. The waterworks and sewerage facilities owned by the city on May 21, 1953, when Ordinance No. 1124 was adopted, or thereafter acquired, is a public utility of the city, held and operated as a single undertaking known as the "water and sewer utility". The properties of the utility include all plants, systems, works, instrumentalities, equipment, materials, supplies, lands, easements, rights in land, water rights, contract rights, franchises, dams, reservoirs, sewage disposal plants, intercepting sewer, trunk connections, sewer and water mains, filtration works, pumping stations, and parts and appurtenances of the foregoing which are used or useful in connection with the obtaining of a water supply and the conservation, treatment and disposal of water for public and private uses and/or used or useful in connection with the collection, treatment and disposal of sewage, waste and storm waters.
11-03-02. Utility Scope. The properties of the utility and all future improvements, extensions and enlargements, together with all cash and other assets in the city's water and sewer utility fund and all moneys derived from the services, facilities, products and by-products of the utility, are dedicated to insuring the public health, safety and welfare by furnishing available water and sewerage service to the city and its inhabitants and industries. The utility is under the management and control of the Board of City Commissioners and is to be operated and maintained in such manner as to provide its
Title 11 10
service with maximum efficiency and at the minimum cost which is comparable with the plan and operation.
11-03-03. Service Rates and Use of Funds. The utility is to be operated and maintained, and the rates for its services, facilities, products and by-products set so that the utility is self-supporting and self-perpetuating. The rates imposed and collected must be at the level necessary to pay the costs of operation and maintenance and to establish and maintain reasonable operating reserves to produce net revenues which are sufficient to pay the principal and interest due on all obligations the city incurred for the improvement of the utility which are payable from net revenues, and to establish and maintain adequate reserves for the security of the obligations; to produce surplus net revenues sufficient to provide reasonable allowances for depreciation and replacement of the utility plus a reasonable return on the city's capital investment. The surplus net revenues, when actually on hand, and not required as a reserve for depreciation and replacement, may be appropriated by the board to pay or contribute to the cost of any other city functions, subject to the limitations prescribed by law.
The foregoing is not to be construed to preclude the city from defraying any or all of the expenses of any improvement, enlargement or extension of the water and sewer utility by levying special assessments or taxes or issuing general obligation bonds to the extent that it is authorized by law and is deemed fair and equitable by the Board of City Commissioners.
11-03-04. Financing of Capital Improvements. It is the policy of the city, subject to modifications deemed by the Board of City Commissioners to be required by the circumstances in individual cases, that the cost of capital improvements, enlargements and extensions of the utility be paid in the following manner:
1. The total cost of water mains eight inches or smaller in diameter or sanitary sewer mains eight inches or smaller in diameter installed adjacent to residential properties, and water mains twelve inches or smaller or sanitary sewer mains ten inches or smaller in diameter installed adjacent to commercial properties, must be charged against the properties benefiting from the improvements. The amount charged against a property may be prepaid where required by the City or assessed against the property. Water and sanitary sewer mains of the dimensions above described are referred to as "lateral" mains, and other larger mains are referred to as "trunk" mains.
2. Where a trunk main is installed, the city engineer shall determine the cost of construction of a lateral main and the cost of the lateral main will be
Title 11 11
charged against the properties benefiting from the improvement.
3. The cost of any main in excess of a lateral main shall be referred to as a trunkline charge and assessed or charged against abutting properties and properties served or capable of being served.
4. The portion of the cost of any improvement, extension or addition to the utility not paid by special assessments or prepayment shall be paid from the revenues of the utility.
5. Where, due to any error or omission or to special circumstances, a special assessment is not levied against property benefited by an improvement at the time of the construction, the city reserves the right to levy a supplemental special assessment upon the property or to impose and collect a special charge for the connection of the property with the utility system in an amount required to pay its just share of the assessable cost of the improvement.
6. The cost of storm sewers shall be assessed against the properties within the area determined to be benefited. An assessment shall be proportionate to and shall not exceed the benefit determined for each property.
(Ord. 4827, 03-11-97)
11-03-05. Separate Accounts Required.
1. All moneys received by the city from the services, facilities, products and by-products furnished by the utility, except collections of special assessments and taxes appropriated to improvement district funds and moneys borrowed for capital improvements, and money, receipts and returns received from investments of the earnings, must be paid into the treasury of the city and kept in a special fund which is permanently maintained on the books of the city, separate and distinct from other funds, and designated as the water and sewer utility fund, in the records of which fund all receipts and disbursements of money on account of or in connection with the utility is entered and reflected. The moneys on hand shall constitute public municipal funds and be deposited like other city funds. Separate accounts within the water and sewer utility fund shall be permanently maintained to segregate the revenues required to meet the several expenses and obligations of the utility, as provided below, and the revenues shall be administered and accounted for as follows:
Title 11 12
a. Operation and maintenance account. There is to be credited at least once in each calendar month to the operation and maintenance account of the fund, as a first lien and charge on the gross revenues of the utility, the sum needed, over and above any credit balance then held, to pay all claims due which by accepted accounting practices constitute normal, reasonable and current expenses of operation and maintenance of the utility, and to pay the expenses estimated to accrue for a period of approximately one month, and to maintain a reasonable service for contingencies. Moneys in the account may be used only to pay expenses of the foregoing type, and not for repairs or replacements or for capital improvements properly chargeable to replacement and depreciation reserves or surplus funds.
b. Revenue bond account. The net revenues of the utility is the aggregate of all sums on hand in the water and sewer utility fund in excess of the current requirements defined in subdivision a of this section. The entirety of net revenues shall be credited each month to the revenue bond account of the water and sewer fund until there is credited so much of the net revenues as is necessary to maintain a reserve in an amount at least equal to the sum of the principal and interest payments due within each next succeeding twelve-month period upon all revenue bonds of the city issued and payable from the accounts. After the reserve is created, there shall continue to be credited out of the net revenues to the revenue bond account each month, over and above sums required to maintain the reserve, an amount not less than one-twelfth of the sum of the principal and interest to become due on all such revenue bonds within the next succeeding twelve months. Moneys in the account may be used only for the payment of principal and interest as it becomes due on the revenue bonds, and the reserve shall be used only when other moneys in the account are insufficient. All revenue bonds issued and payable from the account, subject to the limitations upon the issuance contained herein, constitute a first lien and charge on the net revenues of the utility without preference or priority of one bond over any other; provided that if at any time the moneys in the revenue bond account are insufficient to make all payments of principal and interest due on the revenue bonds, and cannot be made sufficient by transfer of moneys from the other accounts described below, the moneys available shall first pay interest then accrued on all bonds and any excess moneys available to pay matured principal of the bonds in order of their
Title 11 13
maturity dates, provided that moneys available for payment of bonds maturing on the same date must be prorated equally among the bonds.
c. Improvement warrant account. There shall be maintained in the fund an improvement warrant account to segregate net revenues required for the payment of the cost of improvements hereafter instituted, for which the revenues have been pledged in accordance with sections 40-22-15 and 40-22-16 of the North Dakota Century Code. There must be transferred from the account as required, to the fund of each improvement district for which the pledge has been made, sums sufficient, together with tax and assessment collections held in the funds, to pay when due the principal and interest on all improvement warrants drawn upon the funds for the financing of the improvements. Moneys sufficient for the requirements of the improvement district funds shall be credited and paid into the improvement warrant account out of the net revenues remaining after provision for the current requirements of the revenue bond account, and the lien and charge on the net revenues in favor of improvement warrants for the payment of which the pledges have been made is subordinate only to the lien and charge on the net revenues in favor of revenue bonds payable from the revenue bond account. In the event that moneys in the improvement warrant account are insufficient for the making of all transfers required to be made to the several improvement district funds to which the pledges have been made, and cannot be made sufficient by the transfer of funds from the remaining accounts described below, the available moneys must be apportioned first to the several improvement district funds in sums sufficient to pay interest then accrued on all warrants drawn on the district funds, and any remainder applied to matured principal of the warrants in order of the maturity dates. Among warrants maturing on the same date, the available moneys shall be applied to the warrants of the several issues in proportion to the matured principal amount for the payment of which taxes and assessments in the respective improvement funds are insufficient.
d. Replacement and depreciation account. There shall be maintained a replacement and depreciation account into which shall be credited and paid as received, except as otherwise stated below, all net revenues in excess of the current requirements of the other accounts. In the account there is to be maintained the balance the board determines
Title 11 14
constitutes an adequate reserve for depreciation and replacement of the utility. The reserve may be used to redeem prior to maturity obligations payable from the net revenues as and when prepayable according to their terms, or to replace worn out or obsolete properties of the utility, or to make extensions, enlargements or improvements. Any moneys in the account determined to be surplus to the immediate requirements may be invested or transferred to other city funds at the discretion of the board, in the manner and subject to the limitations set forth in section 40-33-12 of the North Dakota Century Code.
e. Moneys on hand. The moneys on hand in any of the accounts of the water and sewer utility fund are available and can be used to restore a deficiency in the funds on hand in any of the preceding accounts, in the order listed above, for the fulfillment of the requirements of those accounts.
f. Additional accounts. The city also reserves the right to create additional accounts within the water and sewer utility fund to segregate any surplus net revenues which may be pledged and appropriated to the payment of obligations issued to finance improvements, enlargements or extensions of the utility, other than the obligations payable from the revenue bond account and the improvement warrant account, pursuant to the authority for the issuance reserved in subsection 1. The moneys on hand in any account are to be available for and used to the extent necessary to meet the current requirements of the foregoing accounts except the replacement and depreciation account.
2. In borrowing money for capital improvements, extensions or additions to the utility, the following must be observed:
a. For the purpose of this section, whenever the net revenues of the utility appropriated to the improvement warrant account are pledged to pay a portion of the cost of any improvement to be financed by improvement warrants, the warrants and the interest accruing thereon is deemed to be payable from the net revenues in the same proportion as that part of the cost payable from the net revenues bears to the principal amount of the warrants; and the portion of the cost payable from net revenues is deemed equal to the principal amount of the warrants less the principal amount of the taxes and assessments agreed to be levied for the payment thereof.
Title 11 15
b. Except as provided in subdivisions c and d, no obligations may be issued and made payable from the revenue bond account or the improvement warrant account unless the net revenues of the utility, as defined in subsection 3, subdivision c, received during the next preceding fiscal year, are in an aggregate amount at least equal to one hundred twenty-five percent of the average annual principal and interest payments due on all bonds payable from the revenue bond account which are then outstanding or then to be issued, plus the percentage of the average of the annual principal and interest payments due on each issue of improvement warrants then outstanding or then to be issued are payable from the net revenues. The averages shall be computed on the basis of the principal and interest payments due in the fiscal years of the then remaining term of all the revenue bonds and improvement warrants outstanding. For the purpose of the computation, whenever rates for water and sewerage service have been changed in the course of any fiscal year, the net revenues for the year is deemed to be that which would have been received if the amended rates had been in effect during the entirety of the year, based upon the actual quantities of service furnished to each class of customers and the actual expenses of the utility during the year, provided that the net revenues computed be deemed to exceed one hundred twenty-five percent of the net revenues actually received during the year.
c. Refunding revenue bonds may be issued to prepay and refund bonds payable from the revenue bond account when they become prepayable according to their terms, provided that the refunding revenue bonds are subject to the requirements set forth in subdivision b, as applied to the past net revenues and future principal and interest requirements as of the date of the issuance of the refunding revenue bonds. However, the city reserves the right to issue refunding revenue bonds, when permitted by law, for the purpose of refunding and extending the maturities of any bonds payable from the revenue bond account which have matured and for the payment of which the moneys in the revenue bond account are insufficient, and cannot be made sufficient by transfer of moneys from other accounts. The refunding revenue bonds are payable from the revenue bond account on a parity as to interest with all then outstanding bonds payable therefrom, but the maturities of the refunding revenue bonds must be subsequent to the maturities of all the outstanding bonds. Nothing requires the holder of a
Title 11 16
revenue bond to accept a refunding revenue bond in exchange.
d. The city reserves the right to issue refunding improvement warrants as provided in Chapter 40-27 of the North Dakota Century Code. The lien and charge of the refunding warrants on the net revenues appropriated to the improvement warrant account are the same as that in favor of the improvement warrants refunded; provided that for the purpose of the computations directed to be made in this section, the maturities and the rate or rates of interest payable on the refunding warrants must be substituted for the maturities and interest rates of the improvement warrants refunded.
e. Nothing herein affects the obligation of the city, under the laws of the state to levy ad valorem taxes upon all taxable property within its corporate limits for the purpose of paying a deficiency in the fund of an improvement district, at the time of the maturity of the last warrant drawn, or at an earlier time as may be directed by law. It is the policy of the city that the amounts of any deficiency tax levies so made must be restored to the general funds of the city out of any surplus net revenues thereafter received, over and above the requirements of the accounts of the water and sewer utility fund as stated in subsection 1.
f. Except as authorized, no obligation of any kind may be issued and made payable from the net revenues unless the lien is expressly made subordinate and junior to the lien and charge on the net revenues in favor of all revenue bonds and improvement warrants payable from the revenue bond account and the improvement warrant account.
11-03-06. Bond and Warrant Covenants. The city covenants and agrees with the original purchaser and each holder of each bond or warrant issued and payable from the revenue bond account or the improvement warrant account, as follows:
1.

CHAPTER 11.1-04. FATS, OIL AND GREASE CONTROL
11.1-04-01. Purpose and Policy. This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for Food Service Establishments (FSEs) that discharge wastewater to the City of Bismarck sanitary sewer. The objectives of this chapter are:
1. To prevent the excessive introduction of fats, oil and grease (FOG) into the sewer system and the wastewater treatment plant;
2. To prevent the accumulation of grease within the sewer system which can lead to sanitary sewer pipe blockages and subsequent back ups and sanitary sewer overflows (SSO);
3. To reduce the costs of maintaining the sewer system by preventing the accumulation of grease and residue within the sewage system lines and ensure that the cost of maintaining the public sewer system is equitably distributed amongst users;
Title 11.1 17
4. To clarify grease disposal requirements for FSEs;
5. To protect public health and safety from pollution caused by SSO.
(Ord. 5575, 03-13-07)
11.1-04-02. Administration. Except as otherwise provided herein, the pretreatment coordinator or designated representative shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 5575, 03-13-07)
11.1-04-03. Definitions. Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise, the following definitions represent the meanings of terms as they are used in this title:
1. “Best Management Practices (“BMPs”)” - A schedule of activities, prohibition of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the introduction of FOG to the sanitary sewer system.
2. “Fats, Oils, and Grease (“FOG”)” - Any substance, such as vegetable, animal or other product that is used in, or is a by-product of, the cooking or food preparation process, and that turns or may turn viscous or may solidify with a change in temperature or other conditions. Grease may originate from, but not limited to, discharges from scullery sinks, pot and pan sinks, dishwashing machines, soup kettles and floor drains located in areas where grease-containing materials may exist.
3. “Food Service Establishment (“FSE”)” - Food service facility licensed by the City of Bismarck that prepares and/or provides food for consumption.
“Class 1 FSE” - Any establishment where a grill, deep fry unit, broaster, wok or grease producing process is used to prepare food. All new Class 1 FSEs are required to install approved grease interceptor(s). All new and existing Class 1 FSEs are required to implement and adhere to the best management practices in this Ordinance.
“Class 2 FSE” - Any establishment using only a heat-producing device, such as a microwave, conventional oven, toaster oven, hot dog rotisserie, coffee maker, etc. to prepare food. Any food establishment that prepares and/or serves meals 2 or fewer times per week or satellite food service establishments where
Title 11.1 18
primary food preparation is conducted offsite or initial preparation of foods does not occur. A satellite food service facility is one that maintains thoroughly cooked food hot. All Class 2 FSEs must implement and adhere to the best management practices in this Ordinance.
4. “Food Waste Disposal Unit” - A device that shreds or grinds up solid or semisolid waste material into smaller portions for disposing it in the sanitary sewer. These devices are also referred to as grinders, garbage grinders and garbage disposals.
5. “Grease Interceptor” - A vault that is located on the exterior of the building which has a minimum of two compartments. The capacity of the interceptor provides adequate residence time so that the wastewater has time to cool, allowing grease to congeal and rise to the surface where it accumulates until the interceptor is cleaned.
6. “Grease Interceptor Waste” - Any grease, food particles, organic or inorganic solid or semisolid waste collected and intercepted by a grease interceptor usually in layers of floatable, suspended and settleable substances, which are ultimately removed for proper disposal.
7. “Grease Trap” – A grease removal device located within the facility, which helps to protect the internal plumbing from grease clogs.
8. “Grease Removal Device” - An interceptor, trap or other mechanical device designed, constructed, and intended to remove, hold, or otherwise prevent the passage of grease to the sanitary sewer.
9. “Sanitary Sewer Overflow” (SSO) - Any unplanned discharge from the separate sanitary sewer system.
10. “Twenty-five percent rule” - A requirement of when grease interceptors shall be fully pumped out and cleaned. This rule requires that when the combined FOG (including floating solids) and the settled solids accumulation reaches 25% of the total designed hydraulic depth of the grease interceptor, the grease interceptors shall be fully pumped out and cleaned. This requirement will help to ensure that the minimum hydraulic detention time and the required available hydraulic volume are maintained to effectively intercept and retain FOG in the interceptor.
Title 11.1 19
Additional definitions relevant to this title are contained in City Ordinance Section 11.1-01-02.

11.1-04-10. Grease Removal System Maintenance. The owner or lessee of every FSE required to install or use a Grease Removal Device shall, at its own expense, inspect, clean, and maintain the Grease Removal Device in efficient operating condition at all times.
1. Facilities with Grease Interceptors
a. Unless otherwise specified by the pretreatment coordinator, each interceptor in active use shall be cleaned at least once every three months or when the total accumulation of surface FOG (including floating solids) and settled solids reaches twenty-five percent (25%) of the grease interceptor’s overall liquid depth (25 Percent Rule), which ever comes first. The pretreatment coordinator may specify cleaning more frequently when quarterly pumping is shown to be inadequate. The pretreatment coordinator may change the required maintenance frequency to reflect changes in actual operating conditions. Any Food Service Establishment desiring a schedule less frequent than quarterly shall submit a request to the pretreatment coordinator along with the maintenance servicing records, including measurements of the thickness of the
Title 11.1 23
floating FOG and bottom solids layer, and volume removed.
b. A reduction in cleaning frequency may be granted by the pretreatment coordinator when it has been determined that the FOG interceptor has adequate detention time for FOG removal. The cleaning frequency will depend on variables such as: (a) the capacity of the device, (b) the amount of grease in the wastewater, (c) the amount of solids in the wastewater and (d) degree of adherence to the FOG BMPs.
c. FSEs shall require the liquid waste hauler, transporter, or any other person cleaning or servicing an interceptor to completely evacuate all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, bottom solids, and grease during servicing. Skimming the surface layer of waste material, partial cleaning of the interceptor or use of any method that does not remove the entire contents of the collection device is prohibited. The suction of the floating materials shall be done prior to removal of other contents. After complete evacuation, the walls, top, and bottom of the interceptor shall then be thoroughly scraped and the residue removed. Upon completion of the servicing, the FSE manager or his/her designated representative shall inspect the interior of the interceptor and then document this servicing in the facility’s grease removal device maintenance log. In the event that the interceptor is larger than the capacity of the vacuum truck, it shall be completely evacuated within a twenty four (24) hour period.
d. The discharge of liquid, semi-solids, or solids back into an interceptor during and/or after servicing is prohibited. Decanting or discharging of any grease removal device wastes back into the grease removal device, any private sewer, any sewage drainage piping, any storm sewer system or any other grease removal device is prohibited.
2. Facilities with Grease Traps.
a. Grease traps shall be serviced at least weekly or when the amount of grease captured is at 50% of the trap’s capacity, which ever is sooner. After the accumulated grease has been removed, the grease trap shall be thoroughly
Title 11.1 24
inspected to make certain that the inlet, outlet, and air relief ports are clear of obstructions.
b. A reduction in cleaning frequency may be granted by the pretreatment coordinator when it has been determined that the grease trap has adequate detention time for FOG removal. The cleaning frequency will depend on variables such as: (a) the capacity of the device, (b) the amount of grease in the wastewater, (c) the amount of solids in the wastewater and (d) degree of adherence to the FOG BMPs.
c. A flow control device must be installed before each grease trap.
d. A dishwasher or food grinder shall not be connected to a grease trap. Exemptions for existing facilities will be granted.
e. Grease traps must be regularly inspected for leaking seams, pipes, and flow control fitting(s) and repaired if necessary. Grease traps and their baffles shall be maintained free of all caked-on FOG and other waste. Removable baffles shall be removed and cleaned during the maintenance process.
f. Grease and other waste removed from the grease trap shall not be disposed of into any drain or sewer. Waste must be disposed of in accordance with federal, state and/or local laws.
3. Facilities with grease removal devices other than grease traps or grease interceptors must follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for operation and maintenance.
(Ord. 5575, 03-13-07)
11.1-04-11. Bacteria, Enzymes and other Chemical Additives.

(Ord. 5575, 03-13-07)
11.1-04-12. Interceptor Construction Requirements. Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with the Plumbing Code. There shall be a minimum of one (1) manhole per ten (10) feet of interceptor length to provide access for cleaning. Manhole covers shall be gastight in construction and have a minimum opening dimension of twenty-four (24) inches.
Title 11.1 25
Concrete covers are not acceptable. In areas where traffic may exist, the interceptor shall be designed for the appropriate traffic load. The access manholes shall extend at least to finished grade and be designed and maintained to prevent surface and ground water from entering the grease interceptor.
(Ord. 5575, 03-13-07)
11.1-04-13. Grease Trap Construction Requirements. Grease traps may be installed on waste lines leading from kitchen floor drains, mop sinks, food preparation and washing sinks, and other fixtures or equipment where grease may be introduced into the sewer system. Class 1 FSEs that currently have grease traps shall retain and maintain them until they install a grease interceptor. FSEs that have grease traps or those that install them are subject to the requirements below:
1. The grease trap may be set on the floor or partially or fully recessed in the floor to suit piping and structural conditions. Baffle systems and all other internal pieces shall be removable to facilitate cleaning and replacement, but must be in place at all other times.
2. There shall be sufficient clearance for the removal of the trap cover for cleaning. The trap shall be equipped with a flow control fitting. A suitable flow control fitting shall be installed ahead of each trap in the waste line beyond the fixture and as close as possible to the underside of the lowest fixture. When wastes of two or more sinks or fixtures are combined for use by one grease trap, a single flow control fitting shall be used. All grease traps shall have a vented waste line to retain water and prevent siphoning.
(Ord. 5575, 03-13-07)
11.1-04-14. Abandoned Grease Interceptors. An FSE that abandons grease interceptors shall have them removed.
(Ord. 5575, 03-13-07)
11.1-04-15. Record Keeping and Inspections. Each FSE shall maintain a grease removal device maintenance log. The log shall include the dates of service, who performed the service and the disposal method. A record of maintenance, repairs, and a log of pumping and waste hauling of contents shall be maintained and provided to the pretreatment coordinator upon request.
1. All FSEs will be inspected periodically by the City. FSEs shall allow the City ready access at all reasonable times for the inspection of grease removal devices and all pertinent maintenance records for the grease removal devices.
Title 11.1 26
2. Upon the showing of proper credentials, the pretreatment coordinator shall have the authority to enter an FSE’s premises for scheduled or unscheduled inspections. Failure of the pretreatment coordinator to make prior arrangements for an inspection shall not be considered a legitimate reason to refuse admittance. An FSE must keep records associated with waste cooking oil collection and disposal, interceptor hauling and maintenance records on-site for a minimum of three (3) years and must be available for inspection by the pretreatment coordinator during normal business hours. A separate maintenance log shall be maintained for each grease removal device. Grease removal device maintenance logs shall include at a minimum the following information:
a. Identification of the grease removal device.
b. The date that maintenance occurred.
c. The volume of grease removed in gallons.
d. The bottom solids fraction and floating grease layer that are removed and the total depth of the grease interceptor in inches.
e. The name of the company and person(s) performing the maintenance.
The waste removed from the grease removal device must be disposed of in accordance with federal, state and/or local laws.
(Ord. 5575, 03-13-07)
11.1-04-16. Reporting. When the pretreatment coordinator has determined that an FSE must provide written reports, these reports shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements of the pretreatment coordinator. Written reports required by this title will be deemed submitted upon actual receipt by the pretreatment coordinator.
(Ord. 5575, 03-13-07)
11.1-04-17. Variance from Grease Interceptor Requirements. A variance from the grease interceptor requirements may be allowed if it is shown that an alternative pretreatment technology is equally effective in controlling the FOG discharge or that it is not feasible to install an interceptor. In determining whether or not to grant a variance, the pretreatment coordinator may consider the following:
Title 11.1 27
1. Whether or not there is adequate space for installation and/or maintenance of a grease interceptor. The FSE must demonstrate that the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible or advisable.
2. Whether or not the FSE can justify and demonstrate that an alternative pretreatment technology is equivalent or better than a grease interceptor in controlling its FOG discharge.
3. Any request for a variance must be made in writing to the pretreatment coordinator. The written request must include the reasons for the FSE’s failure or inability to comply.
Upon a determination by the pretreatment coordinator, in consultation with the Building Official and the Environmental Health Administrator that there are sufficient reasons to justify a variance, the FSE will be relieved to the extent expressly provided for in the variance. A variance shall contain terms and conditions that serve as basis for its issuance. A variance may be revoked at any time if any of the terms and conditions for its issuance are not satisfied or if the conditions upon which the variance was based change to the extent that the justification for the variance no longer exists. The variance shall be valid so long as the FSE remains in compliance with the terms and conditions specified in the variance.
Denial of a variance is subject to an appeal to the Board of City Commissioners. A written notice of appeal must be filed with the City Administrator within 10 days of receipt of the notice of denial. If no appeal is filed within the time specified the action of the pretreatment coordinator shall be final.
Upon receipt of a notice of appeal the Board shall set a date for a hearing within 15 days of receipt of the notice of appeal. Notice of the time and place for the hearing must be served upon the applicant personally or by certified mail at least five days before the hearing. The Board shall hear such testimony and other evidence as it deems necessary and expedient and thereupon make its findings and decision, which shall be final.
(Ord. 5575, 03-13-07)
11.1-04-18. Surcharge For Noncompliant Class 1 Food Service Establishments. Class 1 FSEs that do not install a grease interceptor may pay a monthly surcharge based on the increased
Title 11.1 28
costs due to the accelerated cleaning frequency of the collection system, additional treatment of these wastes and/or the savings incurred for not installing a grease interceptor. A comprehensive study will be undertaken to collect and evaluate data to determine a surcharge process that will be applied equitably.
(Ord. 5575, 03-13-07)
11.1-04-19. Severability. In the event that any provision of this chapter is held to be invalid, illegal, unconstitutional or unenforceable under the laws of the State of North Dakota or the United States of America, such defect shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this chapter which can be given effect without the defective provision or of this chapter as a whole. To this end, the provisions of this chapter are declared severable.
(Ord. 5575, 03-13-07)
11.1-04-20. Enforcement. In the event that a FSE fails to maintain a grease removal device as required in this chapter, the FSE shall be given a seven day notice to perform the maintenance required by this chapter on the grease removal device. If after the seven day notice, the grease removal device is not serviced, the City may order the work to be performed by an approved contractor. The cost of the work shall be billed to the FSE. If the FSE fails to pay the full amount of the bill, the outstanding amount may be assessed against the property where the maintenance was performed.
(Ord. 5575, 03-13-07)
11.1-04-21. Administrative Fees. No fee will be charged for an annual inspection. However, if the Food Service Establishment’s grease removal device is not in compliance with this Ordinance, a $50.00 re-inspection fee may be charged for each inspection thereafter until compliance is achieved.

12-03-05.1. Emergency Vehicle Preemption System (EVPS).
1. EVPS is a traffic control system designated for use by authorized emergency vehicles and authorized City snow removal vehicles and apparatus. EVPS is intended to
Title 12 12
improve traffic movement and safety and efficiency during emergency responses and during snow removal operations by temporarily taking control of signalized intersections. The EVP is comprised of four (4) separate components: An emitter, a detector, an indicator light, and a phase selector/discriminator. The infrared emitter (a high intensity light source) is mounted on an authorized vehicle and functions similar to a strobe light, pulsating at a frequency set by the manufacturer. As an authorized vehicle approaches the intersection, a detector that is located at or near the traffic signal receives the pulsating light. The detector sends an encoded message to the phase selector/discriminator located in the traffic signal control cabinet, which then either holds the existing green light for the approaching authorized vehicle or accelerates the normal cycle of the signal to provide a green light by the time the authorized vehicle reaches the intersection. The indicator light located near the detector is directed toward the oncoming authorized vehicle to inform the driver whether or not the traffic signal has been preempted in their favor.
2. The EVPS may be utilized in connection with emergency responses, maintenance and snow removal operations as follows:
A. Class A Authorized Emergency Vehicles owned or authorized by the City shall use EVPS while on emergency responses only. All emergency responses utilizing the EVPS must comply with the requirement for flashing lights and sirens contained in Section 12-03-04(b)(2). Unless otherwise approved by the City, in writing, all other use of the EVPS is prohibited. The Fire and Police Departments shall develop procedures for the use of the EVPS. Primary jurisdictional responsibility and assignment of priorities shall remain with the City.
B. The EVPS may be activated by authorized personnel for periodic testing, maintenance or repair of the system. Sirens and flashing red lights need not be activated except when the test vehicle exceeds the posted speed limits.
C. The EVPS may be used by public works employees only while engaged in snow removal operations in vehicles or apparatus owned by the City pursuant to policies and procedures promulgated by public works. EVPS for snow removal operations shall be permitted a second tier priority in the EVPS and is subject to preemption by authorized Class A Emergency Vehicles. Public works employees utilizing the EVPS
Title 12 13
shall obey all traffic signals and traffic laws.
D. The use of the City’s EVPS by non-City Class A emergency vehicles is allowed only if specifically authorized by the City of Bismarck.
1. A request by an outside agency for authorization to utilize the EVPS should be submitted in writing to the City Administrator. Submittal shall also include a copy of the requesting agency’s certificate of insurance and verification that emergency vehicle operators have completed a comprehensive training program. An application for access to the EVPS shall be reviewed by a committee consisting of the Fire Chief, Police Chief, and the City Engineer, or their designees. The decision of the Committee shall be final.
3. Penalty. Unauthorized use of the EVPS or other violation of this section shall be an offense.
(Ord. 5040, 04-11-00); (Ord. 6086, 10-14-14)
12-03-06. Written Report of Accident.
1. Immediate notice and written report of accident. The driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of any person or property damage to an apparent extent of one thousand dollars or more shall immediately give notice of such accident to the police department. The name of the motor vehicle insurance policy carrier and the policy number of the driver, or if the driver is not the owner of the vehicle, then the motor vehicle insurance policy carrier and the policy number of the owner of the vehicle, must be furnished to the officer investigating the accident. If the driver does not have the required information concerning insurance to furnish to the investigating law enforcement officer, then within five day of the accident the driver shall supply that information to the driver's license division in the form the division requires.
2. When it appears to the magistrate that any person has failed to file a written report in compliance with this section, he or she shall notify the highway commissioner of such failure so that appropriate action may be taken pursuant to NDCC Section 39-08-09.
3. a. An accident notice is not required from any person who is physically incapable of making the report during the period of such incapacity.
Title 12 14
b. Whenever the driver of a vehicle is physically incapable of giving an immediate notice of an accident and there was another occupant in the vehicle at the time of the accident capable of doing so, such occupant shall make or cause to be given the notice required by the driver.
c. Whenever the driver is physically incapable of making a written report of an accident and such driver is not the owner of the vehicle, then the owner of the vehicle involved shall within five days after learning of the accident make such report not made by the driver.
4. Garages to report. The person in charge of any garage or repair shop to which is brought any motor vehicle which shows evidence of having been involved in a reportable accident as provided in this section or of being struck by any bullet, shall report or cause a report to be made to a police officer within twenty-four hours after such motor vehicle is received, and before any repairs are made to such vehicle, giving the registration number and the name and address of the owner, operator, or person in control of such vehicle with a description of the location and type of damage to the vehicle, or any missing parts, if the vehicle does not have a sticker on a window issued by a police officer, sheriff or highway patrolman bearing information to show that the accident in which the vehicle was involved had been investigated. The police officer investigating any reportable accident shall attach a sticker to the window of any damaged vehicle showing the accident in which such vehicle was involved has been investigated. If the vehicle does bear such a sticker the garage or repair shop need not make the report this section requires and may begin repairs immediately. After repairs have been made and before the vehicle is released, the sticker shall be removed.
5. Operators of tow trucks to report. The person in charge of or the operator of any commercial towing or wrecker service which causes any motor vehicle to be transported to a private residence or business other than a garage or repair shop which shows evidence of having been involved in a reportable accident as provided in this section, or of being struck by any bullet, shall report or cause a report to be made to the police officer within twenty-four hours after such motor vehicle is transported. The report must give the registration number, and the name and address of the owner, operator or person in control of such vehicle with a description of the location and type of damage to the vehicle, or any missing parts, along with the location such vehicle was transported to, if the vehicle
Title 12 15
does not have a sticker on a window thereof issued by a police officer, sheriff, or highway patrolman, bearing information to show that the accident in which the vehicle was involved has been investigated. If the vehicle does bear such a sticker the towing or wrecker service need not make the report this section requires.

1. Green indication:
a. Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersections or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited.
b. Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
c. Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided for in section 12-04-05, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.

a. Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown, except as provided for in subdivision b of this subsection.
b. Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street, after stopping as required by subdivision a of this subsection. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
c. Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided for in section 12-04-05, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter a roadway.
4. In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable, except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

Provided, however, that any municipality may, by ordinance, prohibit parking on any street or highway for the purpose of creating a fire lane, or to provide for the accommodation of heavy traffic during morning and afternoon rush hours, and the privileges extended to such handicapped persons shall not apply on streets or highways where and during such times as parking is prohibited.

3. A certificate issued under this section must be hung from the rearview mirror of the motor vehicle whenever the vehicle is occupying a space reserved for the mobility
Title 12 85
impaired and is being used by a mobility impaired person or another person for the purpose of transporting the mobility impaired person. No part of the certificate may be obscured. A fee of five dollars may be imposed for a violation of this subsection.

When any public or private entity designates parking spaces for use by motor vehicles operated by mobility impaired persons, those reserved spaces must comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities as contained in the appendix to title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, part 36 [28 CFR 36] and must be indicated by blue paint on the curb or edge of the paved portion of the street or parking lot adjacent to the space. In addition to blue paint, each space reserved must also be indicated by an official sign approved by the commissioner bearing the internationally accepted symbol of access for the mobility impaired.

Proof of intent is not required to prove a registered owner's violation of this subsection, the registered owner, however, may be excused from a violation if the owner provides the citing authority with the name and address of the person operating the vehicle at the time of the violation. A vehicle may temporarily use a space reserved for mobility impaired persons without a mobility impaired certificate for the purpose of loading and unloading mobility impaired persons. A person may not stop, stand or park any vehicle in any area of a designated parking space that is shaded blue to designate a loading or unloading area in such a manner as to preclude usage of the area by other mobility impaired identified vehicles. A violation of this subsection is a non-moving violation for which a fee of one hundred dollars must be imposed.
7. Any motor vehicle licensed in another state which displays a special authorized vehicle designation issued by the licensing authority of that state for vehicles used in the transportation of mobility impaired persons must be accorded the same privilege provided in this section for similar vehicles licensed in this state if the laws of the other state provide the same privileges to North Dakota motor vehicles displaying the special identifying certificate authorized in this section.
8. An entity that violates the requirements of subsection 5 is guilty of an infraction if the entity does not comply with subsection 5 within sixty days after receiving official notification of the violation.

1. For an appeal from the denial of a zoning change ordinance or a zoning ordinance text amendment or for any item requiring a public hearing at the city commission, the hearing on appeal will only consider the question of whether or not to reverse the decision of the planning and zoning commission, introduce the ordinance, if necessary, and call for a public hearing on the zoning change ordinance, text amendment ordinance or other item requiring a public hearing. At the hearing, only the aggrieved applicant or their representative, a person entitled to receive mailed written notice of the application or an officer, department, board or bureau of the city may argue for or against the appeal. No new evidence may be presented and the review is limited to the record as received from the planning and zoning commission and the arguments at the hearing.

The written decision shall be issued within 10 calendar days of the close of the hearing. If the city commission decides to reverse the decision of the planning and zoning commission and call for a public hearing and second reading on the zoning change ordinance, the zoning ordinance text amendment, or any other item requiring a public hearing, a hearing will be set for a date that allows the public hearing to be appropriately noticed pursuant to the North Dakota Century Code and this code of ordinances. The written decision shall be issued within 10 days of the close of the hearing.
3. The public hearing resulting from an appeal shall be conducted in accordance with Section 14-07-02(6-8).

Title 14 & 14.1 7
whether or not to require a public hearing or further action at the planning and zoning commission and shall be conducted pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section. The action of the city commission regarding the appeal is limited to denying the appeal and upholding the planning and zoning commission or reversing the planning and zoning commission and sending the matter back to the planning and zoning commission for further action.
5. For all other appeals from a final decision of the planning and zoning commission for which the decision of the city commission will be final, the board of city commissioners shall fix a time for the hearing of the appeal and shall give due notice of the hearing to the parties pursuant to paragraph 1 of this section. The appeal shall be decided and a written decision shall be issued within 10 calendar days of the close of the hearing unless otherwise stipulated by the commission.

(Ord. 4424, 03-31-92; Ord. 4936, 09-08-98; Ord. 5422, 10-24-05; Ord. 6234, 10-25-16)
14-03-02. Boundaries of Districts and Zoning Map. The location and boundaries of districts established in the city are shown on the official zoning map of the city. This map is entitled "Zoning Map of the City of Bismarck, North Dakota" and is on file in the office of the city auditor. This map is hereby made a part of this article. This map shall reflect the ordinances adopted prior to this date and all ordinances adopted after this date relating to the boundaries of zoning districts. The city auditor is authorized and directed to make the necessary changes upon the official zoning map of the city in accordance with such ordinances as they are from time to time enacted.
14-03-03. Interpretation of District Boundaries. Where uncertainties exist as to the boundaries of the various districts as shown on the zoning map accompanying and made a part of this title, the following rules shall apply:
Title 14 & 14.1 33
1. District boundary lines are intended to follow street, alley or lot lines, or lines parallel to or perpendicular thereto, and such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
2. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines and are not more than ten feet distance therefrom, such lot lines shall be such boundaries.
3. Where land within the city limits is not subdivided into lots and blocks or where district boundary lines are not approximately street, alley or lot lines, the district boundary lines on the zoning map shall be determined by the scale shown on such map, and where uncertainty exists, the district boundary line shall be determined by the planning commission by written decision. If land within the city limits has been or is subsequently subdivided into lots and blocks by a duly recorded subdivision map and the lot and block arrangement does not conform to that anticipated when the district boundaries were established, or property is resubdivided by a duly recorded subdivision map into a different arrangement of lots and blocks than shown on said zoning map, the planning commission after notice to the owners of property affected thereby and public hearing, may interpret the zoning map and make minor readjustments in the district boundaries in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of these regulations and conform to the street and lot layout of the ground. Such interpretations or adjustments shall be by written decision, and thereafter the copies of the zoning map shall be changed to conform thereto.
4. Any street, alley or railroad right-of-way, watercourse, channel or body of water, included on the zoning map shall, unless otherwise indicated, be included within the zoning district of adjoining property on either side thereof. Where such street, alley, right-of-way, watercourse, channel or body of water, serves as a boundary between two or more different zoning districts, a line midway in such street, alley, right-of-way, watercourse, channel or body of water, and extending in the general direction of the long dimension thereof shall be considered the boundary between zones. If a dedicated street or alley shown on the zoning map is vacated by ordinance, the property formerly in said street or alley shall be included within the zone of the adjoining property on either side of said vacated street or alley. In the event said street or alley was a zone boundary between two or more different
Title 14 & 14.1 34
zones, the new zone boundary shall be the former center line of said vacated street or alley.
5. Any land or territory in the city which is not indicated on the zoning map as being in any district shall be classified as A-Agricultural.
14-03-04. General Provisions. In interpreting and applying the provisions contained herein, the requirements contained herein are declared to be the minimum requirements necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance.

14-03-09. Nonconforming Uses. Any lawful use of the land or buildings existing at the date of passage of this title, and located in a district in which it would not be permitted as a new use under the regulations of this title, is hereby declared
Title 14 & 14.1 110
to be a nonconforming use, and not in violation of this title. Provided, however, a nonconforming use shall be subject to, and the owner shall comply with the following regulations:
1. Certificate of occupancy. After the adoption of this title, the owner of a nonconforming use shall be notified, by the Building Official, of the provisions of this title. Within thirty days after receipt of said notice, the owner shall apply for and be issued a certificate of occupancy for the nonconforming use. The application for such certificate shall designate the location, nature and extent of the nonconforming use and such other details as may be necessary for the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. If the owner of a nonconforming use fails to apply for a certificate of occupancy within thirty days after receipt of the foregoing notice, the use ceases to be nonconforming and is hereby declared to be in violation of this title. The Building Official and city attorney shall take appropriate action to enjoin such violation. If the Building Official shall find, upon reviewing the application for a certificate of occupancy that the existing use is illegal or in violation of other ordinances or laws, or if he finds that the building for which the certificate is requested has been constructed or altered for the existing use or any other use without full compliance with the building code or zoning ordinance in effect at the time of construction or alteration, he shall not issue the certificate of occupancy, but shall declare such use to be in violation of this article.
2. Nonconforming Use-Extension. The nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout any part of a building clearly designed for such use but not so used at the date of the adoption of this title. No nonconforming use may be extended to occupy any land outside the building nor any additional building not used for such nonconforming use at the date of adoption of this title. The nonconforming use of land shall not be extended to any additional land not so used at the date of the adoption of this title.
3. Nonconforming Use-Additions, repair, alteration. No building used for a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, or structurally altered, unless the use is changed to one which complies with the provisions of this title. Provided, however, permits may be issued for the reconstruction of an existing building to be continued as a
Title 14 & 14.1 111
nonconforming use if the following conditions are complied with:
a. New use would decrease the number of living units or population density in case such is violated.
b. New use would decrease the automobile parking congestion in the area.
c. New use would not increase the cubical contents of the structure if such would violate provisions of this ordinance.
d. Such reconstruction would be one in accordance with the city building, plumbing, electrical codes and fire prevention code.
e. The issuance of such permit would not violate the provisions of paragraph 4 of this section.
In addition, repairs and maintenance work may be carried out each year in an amount not to exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the assessed value of the building for that year. Such repairs and maintenance work shall not increase the cubical content of the building, nor the floor area devoted to the nonconforming use. Nor shall it increase the number of dwelling units provided in a building. Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or repair of a building which may be necessary to restore the building to a safe condition or to improve the sanitary conditions of the building, provided that such strengthening and repair may not be used to restore a building to the provisions of paragraph 4 of this section.
Alterations may be made to a nonconforming principal residential structure or any principal building in which there is a nonconforming residential use when the alteration will improve the livability thereof, provided it will not increase the number of dwelling units or the outside dimensions of the building.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, any principal nonconforming use or structure that is located in an R5 – Residential or R10 – Residential zoning district, occupied by a single-family or two-family residence, and not subject to the provisions of the FP Floodplain overlay district, may be expanded if all of the following conditions are met:
Title 14 & 14.1 112
a. Nonconforming setbacks are not further reduced;
b. Nonconforming building separations are not further reduced;
c. Nonconforming height is not further increased;
d. No additional nonconforming conditions are created.
4. Nonconforming Use-Destruction. If any nonconforming structure or any building in which there is a nonconforming use is damaged by fire, flood, explosion, wind, war or other catastrophe, in an amount equal to or greater than fifty percent (50%) of its assessed valuation, it shall not be again used or reconstructed to be used for any use except one complying with the provisions of this article for the district in which it is located.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, any principal nonconforming use or structure devoted in whole or in part to a residential use that is damaged or destroyed by any means, to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its structural value prior to the damage, that structure may be restored, repaired or rebuilt in its entirety if all of the following conditions are met:
a. The building or structure will not occupy any portion of the lot that was not occupied by the destroyed structure;
b. The building or structure will not have a greater floor area than the destroyed structure;
c. The building or structure will not exceed the height or number of stories contained in the destroyed structure;
d. The number of off-street parking spaces located on the property will not be reduced from the number available before the damage; and
e. The building permit for the repair or restoration must be obtained within six (6) months of date of the damage and restoration must begin within one (1) year of the date of the damage.
Title 14 & 14.1 113
5. Nonconforming Use-Moving Building. Any building in which there is a nonconforming use shall not be moved unless it is moved to a district in which the use for which the building was designed is permitted by this title. If any building in which there is a nonconforming use is moved any distance whatsoever, the building shall thereafter be used only in compliance with the provisions of this article for the district in which it is located.
6. Nonconforming Use-Change. A nonconforming use may be continued in accordance with the provisions of this section, but it shall not be changed to any other use except the one which would be permitted as a new use in the district in which the building is located.
7. Nonconforming Use-Discontinuance.
a. If for any reason a nonconforming use of land ceases for a continuous period of more than thirty (30) days, the land shall thereafter not be used except in compliance with the provisions of this article for the district in which the land is located.
b. If for any reason a nonconforming use of a building ceases for a continuous period of more than six (6) months, the building shall thereafter not be used except in compliance with the provisions of this title for the district in which the building is located.
8. Nonconforming Use-Continuance. Any legal nonconforming use, except those listed in paragraph 9 of this section, may be continued. The certificate of occupancy issued by the Building Official for a nonconforming use shall state that the use may be continued indefinitely or, for those uses listed in paragraph 9 of this section, that the use must be discontinued.
All periods of time shown below in paragraph 9 shall begin thirty-one (31) days after receipt by the owner of notice of the provisions of this title. Upon application to the board of adjustment the board may, in certain cases, extend the date of the certificate of occupancy for one period of time not to exceed the limit indicated in paragraph 9 of this section.
9. Nonconforming Use-Period of Continuance. Certain nonconforming uses, indicated in the following table shall be discontinued at the expiration of the periods of time
Title 14 & 14.1 114
shown, or at the expiration of one extension period, as provided in paragraph 8 of this section:
Nonconforming Use Period of Continuance Limit of

14-03-10. Off-Street Parking and Loading.
1. Purpose. The off-street parking and loading regulations of this Section are intended to provide an appropriate number of off-street parking spaces in proportion to the needs of the proposed use and to increase public safety by reducing the congestion on public streets.
2. Applicability. The off-street parking and loading requirements contained herein shall apply to any of the following:
a. New Development. The off-street parking, stacking and loading requirements of this section shall apply to any new building constructed and to any new use established.
b. Expansion and Alterations. The off-street parking, stacking and loading requirements of this section shall apply when an existing structure or use is expanded or enlarged. Additional off-street parking and loading spaces will be required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area. The parking, stacking and loading space provided for the existing use prior to the expansion or alteration may not be reduced.
c. Change of Use. The off-street parking, stacking and loading requirements of this section shall apply to any change of use that would result in a requirement for more parking, stacking or loading spaces than the existing use. Additional parking, stacking and loading spaces will be required only in proportion to the extent of the change, not for the entire building or use.
Title 14 & 14.1 115
In the case of a change of use where the current use does not meet the minimum requirements for off-street parking, stacking and/or loading, and the proposed change of use would require less off-street parking, stacking or loading spaces than the current use, regardless of the number of spaces actually provided on the site, the Zoning Administrator may allow such change of use provided the off-street parking, stacking and loading for the new use is no less conforming than the current use.
3. Off-street parking. Except as provided elsewhere in this section, no application for a building permit or certificate of occupancy in any zone shall be approved unless there is included with the plan for such building improvement or use, a site plan showing the required space designated as being reserved for off-street parking purposes to be provided in connection with such building improvements or use in accordance with this section; and no certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless the required facilities have been provided. Each required parking space shall be of an area at least nine (9) feet wide and eighteen (18) feet in length, in addition to the ingress and egress driveways required. The required off-street parking, loading, and access areas shall be used exclusively for the temporary parking and maneuvering of vehicles and shall not be used for the sale, lease, display, repair, or storage of vehicles, trailers, boats, campers, mobile homes, merchandise, or equipment, or for any other use not authorized by the provisions of this Title. All off-street parking spaces required and all driveways on private property leading to such parking areas shall be surfaced with a dustless all-weather hard surface material. Acceptable surfacing materials include asphalt, concrete, brick, cement pavers or similar materials installed and maintained according to industry standards. Crushed rock or gravel shall not be considered an acceptable surfacing material. All parking areas containing four (4) or more spaces or containing angled parking shall have the parking spaces and aisles clearly marked on the pavement.

b. Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section relative to off-street parking, off-street loading shall be provided as designated elsewhere in this section.
9. Location of required parking and loading facilities. The off-street parking facilities required by this section shall be on the same lot or parcel of land as the structure they are intended to serve; provided, however, when practical difficulties, prevent the establishment of such facilities upon the same lot or parcel, they shall be furnished within four hundred feet (400) of the premises to which they are appurtenant. Off-site parking lots within residential areas are subject to the requirements of Section 14-03-08(4)(x). The off-street loading facilities required by this section shall in all cases be on the same lot or parcel of land as the structure they are intended to serve. In no case shall the required off-street loading space be
Title 14 & 14.1 125
part of the area used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements of this article. All required off-street parking and loading facilities along with all ingress and egress driveways thereto shall be zoned appropriately for the principal use which they are intended to serve.
10. Plan of required off-street parking or loading areas. For the purpose of converting parking or loading spaces into the required parking or loading area, plans must be submitted to the Zoning Administrator to show how the required parking or loading space shall be arranged in the area supplied for that purpose and to indicate sufficient space for parking maneuvers, as well as adequate ingress and egress to the parking or loading area. For each parking space, not under roof, there shall be provided additional area for lanes, alleys, aisles and drives necessary for safe and adequate parking maneuvering. For each off-street loading space required by this section there shall be provided space clear and free of all obstructions, at least ten (10) feet in width, fifty feet (50) feet in length and fourteen (14) feet in height. Off-street parking and off-street loading space shall be provided with methods of ingress and egress such that it will be unnecessary for trucks or tractor-trailer combinations to back into them from a street or out of them into a street. Off-street loading spaces may utilize adjacent local streets as needed for ingress and egress when specifically approved in writing by the City Engineer or his designee, based upon a submitted drawing using truck turning radius templates that demonstrates how the loading spaces will be utilized.
11. Use of required off-street parking by another building. No part of an off-street parking area required for any building or use for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this section shall be included as a part of an off-street parking area similarly required for another building or use unless the type of structure indicates that the periods of usage for such structures will not be simultaneous with each other, as determined by the board of adjustment.
12. Maintenance of public off-street parking places provided. All off-street parking facilities for the use of the public required pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be paved, drained, lighted and periodically maintained by the owner in accordance with specifications of the city engineer, and such facilities shall be arranged for convenient access and safety of pedestrians and vehicles. No open area in an off-street parking area shall be
Title 14 & 14.1 126
encroached upon by buildings, storage or any other use; nor shall the number of parking spaces be reduced except upon the approval of the board of adjustment and then only after proof that, by reason of diminution of floor space, seating capacity, number of employees, or change in other factors controlling the regulation of the number of parking spaces, the proposed reduction is reasonable and consistent with the intent of this section.
13. Collective action relative to off-street parking and loading. Nothing in this title shall be construed to prevent the joint use of off-street parking or off-street loading space for two or more buildings or uses, if the total of such spaces when used together shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the various individual uses computed separately in accordance with this section.
14. Mixed uses. In the case of mixed uses, except as provided for in subsection 1(h)(2) of this section for a multi-tenant shopping center, the total requirements for off-street parking and off-street loading space shall be the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately as specified in subsections 1 and 2 of this section, and the off-street parking and off-street loading space for one use shall not be considered as providing the required off-street parking or off-street loading space for any other use.
15. Nonconforming uses. In the case of nonconforming uses where major repairs, substantial alterations or extensions are made, no such major repairs, substantial alterations or extensions shall be permitted unless and until the off-street parking and off-street loading facility space requirements of this section, so far as they apply to the use to which such building is devoted, shall be fully provided for. Provided, however, this item shall not apply to the rebuilding of nonconforming uses that are being rebuilt according to section 14-03-09 of the zoning ordinance, or to structures located upon lots in districts being assessed for city-operated parking lots.
16. Vacant lots. Vacant lots may be used for temporary off-street parking purposes if they meet the following criteria:

14-03-11. Landscaping and Screening.
1. Purpose. The purpose of these regulations are to maintain the City’s quality and character by enhancing its visual appearance through the use of landscaping; enhance environmental conditions by providing shade, air purification, reduction of storm water run-off, and filtering of noise and light; promote neighborhood character, traffic calming, wildlife habitat, pedestrian amenity and aesthetic value, screen off-street parking areas and exterior storage areas from view of persons on public streets and adjoining properties and mitigate off-site headlight projection; provide buffer areas between land uses of differing intensity; and encourage the planting of trees and other plant materials throughout the community that are native or generally suitable for this area.
2. Applicability. The landscaping requirements contained herein shall apply to any of the following:
a. The construction of any principal commercial, industrial, institutional, or multi-family building(s) with three (3) or more units or an accessory building for any of the above uses;
Title 14 & 14.1 128
b. The installation of any parking area or the expansion of any existing parking area by five (5) or more off-street parking spaces;
c. A change in the use of the property that requires rezoning to a more intensive zoning classification or a special use permit; and
d. The reconstruction of a portion of an existing off-street parking lot equal to or greater than twenty percent (20%) at one time or forty percent (40%) over a five (5) year period, regardless of whether or not required parking spaces are added, and provided the required plant materials do not reduce the number of off-street parking spaces below what is required. Reconstruction includes any land disturbance activity or exposure of any subgrade or soil material. Regular maintenance, minor repairs, patch work or a partial mill and overlay would not constitute reconstruction. Only those portions of the off-street parking areas being reconstructed would be subject to these requirements. Consideration may be given by the Director of Community Development and the City Forester on a case-by-case basis to modify the requirements for the reconstructed off-street parking areas.
3. General Requirements. All exposed ground areas, including areas not devoted to off-street parking, drives, sidewalks or other such improvements shall be landscaped with grass, vegetative ground cover, shrubs, trees or other ornamental landscape materials in conjunction with site development. All landscaped areas shall be kept neat, clean and uncluttered. No required landscaped area shall be used for parking of vehicles or for the storage or display of materials, supplies or merchandise. Boulevard areas shall be subject to the requirements of Sections 10-03-14 and 10-05-04.
The Director of Community Development and the City Forester may allow the placement of existing and/or required landscaping to be altered as deemed appropriate.
4. Landscaping Plan Required. A landscape plan shall be required for all development subject to the provisions
Title 14 & 14.1 129
of this subsection. All landscape plans submitted for approval shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:

Title 14 & 14.1 130
j. A landscaping phasing plan must be provided if the required landscaping will be installed with phased development.
5. Landscape Design Considerations. Landscape design should serve to provide visually interesting open space, reduce the potential negative impact of development on adjacent land uses, and complement the scale of the development and its surroundings. The following items are to be considered in developing a landscape plan for submittal to the City:
a. Landscape materials and structural items placed within the sight triangle of a corner lot, as defined in Section 14-02-03, shall not have a height of more than three (3) feet above the curb level during all stages of plant growth. Deciduous trees may be planted within the sight triangle provided they are not an obstruction to vision between three (3) feet and ten (10) feet above the curb level;
b. Landscape materials and structural items at driveway entrances shall be placed so that visibility for vehicles entering or exiting a parking lot is not obstructed;
c. Trees or shrubs shall not be planted under utility lines when their ultimate height may interfere with the lowest lines;

a. Purpose. The street tree requirements are intended to promote air quality, shade, neighborhood character, traffic calming, reduced storm water runoff, wildlife habitat, pedestrian amenity and aesthetic value.
b. Applicability. Street trees shall be installed in conjunction with the construction of any principal commercial, industrial, institutional or multi-family building with more than three (3) units along a section of public roadway with curb and gutter installed or scheduled to be installed in conjunction with the project.
c. Location. Street trees shall be installed within the public right-of-way or within ten (10) feet of the public right-of-way.
d. Spacing and Planting Requirements. Unless the City Forester determines that it is necessary to address specific site conditions, three (3) deciduous trees are required for every one hundred (100) linear feet of street frontage. Street trees need not be placed at exact intervals, but they must be placed evenly along the street frontage. The City Forester shall have the authority to determine the final location of street trees in accordance with Section 13-02-01 of the City Code. Mulch shall be installed to a minimum coverage thickness of two (2) inches within a radius of three (3) feet of the trunk base, and in accordance with the City Forester’s planting standards and specifications. Tree grates may be used in lieu of mulching at the discretion of the City Forester.
e. Permit Required. A planting permit must be obtained from the Forestry Division of the Public Works Department prior to planting any trees within the public right-of-way.
8. Perimeter Parking Lot Landscaping.
a. Purpose. The perimeter parking lot landscaping requirements are intended to screen views of parking lots and access lanes from public rights-of-way, mitigate off-site headlight projection,
Title 14 & 14.1 134
and provide pervious surfaces to reduce storm water run-off.
b. Applicability. Perimeter parking lot landscaping shall be required with the installation or reconstruction (as defined in subsection 2(d))of any off-street parking area or access lane adjacent to the public right-of-way and/or visible from and within three hundred (300) feet of a public right-of-way.
c. Standards. All parking lots and access lanes shall provide perimeter landscaping between said off-street parking areas and access lanes and adjacent public rights-of-way. Said perimeter landscaping shall be constructed with standard poured-in-place concrete curbing on the parking lot side in order to minimize damage to plant material. Said perimeter curbing may be modified to allow for storm water management applications designed to function as rain gardens, bioswales or storm water infiltration areas at the discretion of the Director of Community Development and the City Forester.
d. Trees and Shrubs. Trees and shrubs shall be installed in accordance with the following table. The intent of the minimum requirements column is to provide a total number of trees and shrubs required based on street frontage, not to dictate the spacing of the trees and shrubs within that frontage. For fractions of the specified linear feet, the number of trees and shrubs required shall be the corresponding fraction.
Parking Lot Size (Number of Spaces) Minimum Landscaping Width Minimum Requirements
Less than 100
4 feet; or

30 feet
4 shade or ornamental trees and 10 shrubs for every 100 linear feet of street frontage.
40 feet or greater
4 shade or ornamental trees for every 100 linear feet of street frontage.
e. Applicability to Industrial Districts. Within the MA – Industrial and MB – Industrial zoning districts, the Director of Community Development and the City Forester may waive or modify perimeter parking lot landscaping requirements based on site conditions if the parking lot has twenty-five (25) or fewer parking spaces and the property is not located along a collector or arterial roadway.
f. Grade Differential. Consideration will be given for parking areas and access lanes that are significantly above or below the finish grade of the adjacent public right-of-way. Modifications to the required plant quantities will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the Director of Community Development and the City Forester with the submittal of section and/or elevation drawings showing how the design will meet the intent of the ordinance.
g. Separation. For off-street parking areas with varying widths adjacent to a public right-of-way, the average separation distance between the parking area and the right-of-way will be the basis for the required plant materials.
h. Substitutions. The Director of Community Development and the City Forester may allow perennials to be substituted for a portion of the required shrubs on a two-to-one basis (two perennials to one shrub), and for one shade tree to be substituted for three shrubs, based on specific site conditions and the overall landscape design for the site.
9. Interior Parking Lot Landscaping.
a. Purpose. The interior parking lot landscaping requirements are intended to break up large
Title 14 & 14.1 137
expanses of pavement, provide relief from the heat island effect associated with paved areas, promote air quality, shade, aesthetic value, and provide pervious surfaces to reduce storm water run-off.
b. Applicability. Interior parking lot landscaping applies to any new or reconstructed parking lot (as defined by subsection 2(d)).
c. Standards. All parking lots containing fifty (50) or more off-street parking spaces shall provide interior landscape areas within the parking lot. Said landscape areas shall be provided at the rate of ten (10) square feet per parking space, shall be no less than ten (10) feet by ten (10) feet (100 square feet), and shall be constructed with poured-in-place concrete curbing to minimize damage to plant material. Said curbing may be modified to allow for storm water management applications designed to function as rain gardens, bioswales or storm water infiltration areas at the discretion of the Director of Community Development and the City Forester. For parking lots with one hundred (100) to four hundred (400) parking spaces, at least fifty percent (50%) of the landscape areas shall be no less than six hundred (600) square feet in area with a minimum width dimension of ten (10) feet. For parking lots with more than four hundred (400) parking spaces, at least fifty percent (50%) of the landscape areas shall be no less than twelve hundred (1200) square feet in area with a minimum width dimension of ten (10) feet.
d. Placement of Landscape Areas. Live plant material should be evenly dispersed throughout the parking area.
e. Trees and Shrubs. At least one (1) shade tree and three (3) shrubs shall be provided for every twenty (20) parking spaces or fraction thereof within the off-street parking area. One (1) shade tree may be substituted for three (3) shrubs, but shrubs may not be substituted for shade trees. The Director of Community Development and the City Forester may allow perennials to be substituted for a portion of the required shrubs on a two-to-one basis (two perennials to one
Title 14 & 14.1 138
shrub), based on specific site conditions and the overall landscape design for the site.
f. For sites located within industrial zoning districts, the required plant material for interior landscape islands located in areas designated for truck maneuverability may be relocated throughout the site at the discretion of the Director of Community Development and the City Forester.
10. Buffer Yards.
a. Purpose. The buffer yard requirements are intended to provide separation between land uses of differing intensity. Buffer yards utilize a combination of distance and plantings to form a dense landscaping screen to mitigate the undesirable impacts associated with incompatible land uses on adjacent properties. Earthen berms and/or opaque wood or similar screening fence as defined in this section may also be used where appropriate at the discretion of the Director of Community Development and the City Forester.
b. Applicability. Buffer yards shall be required between a single- or two-family residential use and zoning and any other non-agricultural land use, and between a multiple family residential use (three (3) or more units) and any commercial, industrial or institutional use in all zoning districts except when both properties are located within the Downtown Core (DC) and/or Downtown Fringe (DF) zoning districts. Buffer yards shall also be required for parking lots and access lanes associated with these uses, whether they are located on the same parcel or on a separate parcel.
c. Location of Buffer Yards. Buffer yards shall be located along the entire length of any lot line where two (2) land uses of differing intensity abut, excluding areas adjacent to access points and sight triangles.

1. General description. The AN Airport Noise overlay district for the area around the Bismarck Municipal Airport is hereby established based on the analysis and recommendations of the F.A.R. Part 150 Noise Compatibility Plan prepared for the Bismarck Municipal Airport. The AN zone is an overlay zone, the requirements and standards of which shall supplement the requirements and standards of the underlying zone. For the AN Airport Noise district, in promoting the general purposes of this ordinance, the specific interest of this section is:
a. To establish specific standards within noise-impacted areas to help mitigate the problems caused by airport noise.
b. To encourage the establishment of, and continuing operation of land uses within the overlay
Title 14 & 14.1 230
district which are compatible with the recommendations of the F.A.R. Part 150 Noise Compatibility Plan for the airport.
c. To permit the establishment of, and continuing operation of land uses within the overlay district which are non-compatible with the recommendations of the F.A.R. Part 150 Noise Compatibility Plan for the airport, provided such uses are located on lots of record which exist as of the date of enactment of this ordinance.
d. To prohibit the development of new noise-sensitive land uses within the overlay district, except as provided under the provisions of this ordinance.
2. AN district boundaries. The boundaries of the AN airport noise district are shown on the official zoning map of the city and generally correspond to the area impacted by noise exceeding 65 Ldn based on a combination of noise contours for the 1989 Official Noise Exposure Map, the 1990 Noise Compatibility Plan, and the 1995 Noise Compatibility Plan as presented in the F.A.R. Part 150 Noise Compatibility Study prepared for the Bismarck Municipal Airport and dated February 12, 1991.
3. Definitions.
a. Day-Night Sound Level(Ldn): A cumulative noise metric which describes the noise occurring during a 24-hour period as averaged over one year.

14-04-21.1 DC Downtown Core District.
1. Purpose. The purpose of the Downtown Core District is to preserve and enhance the mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented nature of the City’s downtown area. The district allows a wide range of mutually supportive uses in order to enhance downtown Bismarck’s role as a commercial, cultural, governmental, health/ medical, entertainment and residential center. The district standards also facilitate the creation of a strong and distinctive sense of place through the inclusion of open space and public plazas. The use of design standards will maintain the historical integrity, enhance the quality of design, and preserve the human-scale development of downtown.
2. Uses. Uses are allowed in the Downtown Core District in accordance with the Use Table of Section 14-04-21.
3. Dimensional Standards. Development within the Downtown Core District is subject to the following dimensional standards:
a. Lot Area. The minimum lot area is 7,000 square feet. For lots platted prior to 1953, the minimum lot area is 5,000 square feet.
b. Lot Width. The minimum lot width is 25 feet.
c. Lot Depth. There is no lot depth requirement.
d. Front Yard Setback. There is no minimum front yard setback. New buildings shall be built to the front property line. If the development site is between two existing buildings which are both setback from the front property line, the new building shall be built to match the setback of the adjacent building with the least setback distance from the property line. In no case shall a setback greater than 15 feet be allowed. Consideration will be given to privately-owned spaces that are designed to provide space for
Title 14 & 14.1 240
public seating, public events, public displays, public gatherings and public performances. The area shall be landscaped and/or incorporate streetscape elements on a case-by-case basis.
e. Side Yard Setback. There is no minimum side yard setback, unless the side property line abuts residentially-zoned property, in which case the minimum side yard setback shall be 6 feet.

h. Lot Coverage. The maximum lot coverage is 100%.
4. Design Standards. All development within the Downtown Core District is subject to the following design standards:
a. Intent. The intent of the design standards is to create and maintain a high visual quality and appearance for the Downtown Core District. The regulations are also intended to ensure that new buildings, building additions, façade alterations, building rehabilitations, and signage are compatible with or improve the character of the Downtown Core District and fit into their surroundings. It is also the intent of these regulations to stimulate and protect public and private investment through the establishment of high standards with respect to spatial enclosure, architectural design, building materials, and appearance, and to support the preservation of historically significant buildings.
b. Review and Approval. All new buildings, building additions, facade alterations (both structural and non-structural), demolition of existing buildings, signage, streetscape installation or modification, fences, lighting and improvements within the public right-of-way within the Downtown Core
Title 14 & 14.1 241
District shall be subject to the City’s downtown design review procedures and guidelines established in the Downtown Design Guidelines document and must be approved prior to issuance of any permits. The City’s Renaissance Zone Authority is authorized to act as the Downtown Design Review Committee and shall review project applications for conformance with the Downtown Design Guidelines. After review, the Renaissance Zone Authority may approve an application, deny the application or ask for project modification before approval. The City’s Downtown Design Review Committee may delegate design review related tasks to Community Development staff. The building official is authorized by the Downtown Design Review Committee to review sign project applications for design compliance and grant permits to sign applications that meet design standards in the ordinance. Any sign application that is denied because it does not meet design standards in the ordinance may be appealed to the Renaissance Zone Authority acting as the Downtown Design Review Committee upon the request of the applicant. A decision by the Renaissance Zone Authority, acting as the Downtown Design Review Committee regarding the application of the design guidelines, may be appealed to the Board of City Commissioners pursuant to the process outlined in Section 14-06-03(3) of the City Code of Ordinances (Appeal to the Board of City Commissioners).
c. Restoration or Rehabilitation of Historically Significant Buildings. Any building listed on the National Register of Historic Places, identified as being individually eligible for listing on the National Register or identified as contributing to the downtown Bismarck historic district in the Historic Architectural Inventory and Evaluation (2000) or any subsequent inventory and evaluation, is considered to be a historically significant building. For any building not identified above that is more than 50 years old, a determination shall be made on a case-by-case basis as to whether or not the building is historically significant. Projects involving the restoration or rehabilitation of existing historically significant buildings should reflect the original architectural character of the building and its characteristics. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize the building shall be avoided. The introduction of any new design elements should be consistent with the
Title 14 & 14.1 242
traditional features of the building. The rehabilitation of existing historically significant buildings is encouraged to be in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. All projects involving the restoration or rehabilitation of historically significant buildings are subject to review by the Downtown Design Review Committee.
d. New Construction. Projects involving new construction shall consider the context of the site and be compatible with the general character of the downtown area. While new buildings are required to fit into their surroundings, the City will not require uniformity of design or dictate specific architectural styles. The overall context of the downtown area includes a variety of architectural styles and these regulations are intended to allow both flexibility and creativity in achieving compatible design solutions. All new construction projects are subject to the design criteria established in the Downtown Design Guidelines document. All new construction projects are subject to review by the Downtown Design Review Committee to ensure the design meets the intent of the Downtown Design Guidelines.
e. Renovation or Rehabilitation of Existing Structures. Projects involving the renovation of existing structures that are not historically significant shall consider the context of the site and be compatible with the general character of the downtown area. Renovations of existing structures are subject to the design criteria established in the Downtown Design Guidelines document.

The following building materials are specifically prohibited from use as the primary exterior finish: unfinished, precast concrete block, vinyl or steel siding, rough sawn wood, or other materials typically found on residential dwellings.
All subsequent renovations, additions and related structures undertaken after the construction of an original building shall be finished with materials comparable to those used in the original construction and shall be designed in a manner conforming to the original architectural design and general appearance.
For existing historically significant buildings, the sheathing or installation of another material over the facade or any wall visible from the street shall be prohibited unless deemed necessary to preserve the structural integrity of the building.
h. Building Design Aspects. Design aspects including mass, form, scale, colors, height, alignment, width and horizontal rhythm shall be in accordance with the Downtown Design Guidelines and be approved by the Downtown Design Review Committee. All other building design aspects not listed herein shall be accordance with the Downtown Design Guidelines.

Recessed entrances shall allow operation of the door(s) without the doors extending beyond the property line into the public right-of-way.
j. Windows. Ground floor windows shall be transparent. The original size, shape and proportion of all windows on existing historically significant buildings shall be preserved. For new non-residential buildings, a minimum of seventy percent (70%) of first floor facades fronting the street shall be windows, doors and other transparent elements. In order to preserve the character of existing historically significant buildings, it is not the intent of this provision to require windows to be installed where
Title 14 & 14.1 244
none existed in the original design. However, if the exterior of an existing historically significant building is being remodeled, renovated or rehabilitated, the size, shape and proportion of the original window openings shall generally be restored or maintained. Replacement windows shall generally conform with the style of the original windows used in the building.
k. Rooftop Equipment. Rooftop equipment shall be screened from ground level views with parapet walls or enclosures similar in form, material and detail to the primary structure.

The lot shall be maintained and kept free of debris and litter. If common walls are exposed due to demolition of adjoining buildings, the walls shall be treated to ensure that the walls do not become a visual detriment. The treatment may be temporary or permanent depending on the potential for redevelopment of adjoining parcels. Permanent alternative treatments include architectural treatment that is similar to the front façade of the building or stucco. The wall treatment shall be in place within ninety (90) days of the date of demolition, unless a longer period is authorized at the time of approval of the demolition plans, and shall be the financial responsibility of the owner of the property upon which the demolished building was located.
m. Work in Public Right-of-Way. Any work within the public right-of-way that relates to an identified streetscape element, as identified in the Streetscape Guidelines for Downtown Bismarck (May 1995) or subsequent updates, shall be in accordance with the design elements identified by those guidelines and shall comply with the standards established by the City Engineer.

The board of adjustment shall not have the power to amend this article on zoning, nor to permit nor prohibit any actions which accomplish an amendment of this article on zoning, nor to permit any action nor fail to prohibit any action which would violate this article. However, it is declared the intent of this section that any actions taken by the board of adjustment in full compliance with the provisions of this section shall be deemed to be administrative actions, and shall not be interpreted as unauthorized amendments of the article. The board of adjustment shall have the following powers and duties:
1. Interpretation. On appeal from an order, requirement, determination or provision made by the Zoning Administrator or other administrative official, or by request from any official, agency or head of the city, the board of adjustment shall decide any question involving the interpretation of any provision of this article.

On appeal from an order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official, the board of adjustment may vary or adjust the strict application of any of the requirements of this article in the case of an exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow or steep lot or other exceptional physical or topographical condition, by reason of which the strict application of the provisions of the article would result in unnecessary hardship that would deprive the owner of a reasonable use of the land or building involved, but in no other case.
No adjustment in the strict application of any provisions of this article shall be granted by the board of adjustment unless it finds:
a. That there are special circumstances or conditions, fully described in the findings of the board, applying to the land or buildings for which the variance is sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land or building, and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the neighborhood, and have not resulted from any act of the applicant taken
Title 14 & 14.1 275
subsequent to the adoption of this article, whether in violation of the provisions of the article, or not.
b. That, for reasons fully set forth in the findings of the board, the circumstances or conditions so found are such that the strict application of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of said land or building, and the granting of the variances is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building, and that the variance as granted by the board is the minimum variance that will accomplish the relief sought by the applicant.
c. That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this article, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.

The board of adjustment shall have the power to renew a certificate of occupancy for nonconforming use in accordance with the provisions of Section 14-03-09 of this article. In granting such renewal, the board of adjustment shall determine that the temporary continuation will not be injurious to the neighborhood, nor to the public welfare, and that there are unusual circumstances or conditions which would create an unnecessary hardship on the applicant for extension, if such extension were refused. The board of adjustment may refuse to grant an extension of the certificate of occupancy for a nonconforming use if application for such extension is received by the board of adjustment less than fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration of the original certificate of occupancy.

Title 14 & 14.1 276

Dakota, this article, or any other ordinance of the City of Bismarck, as it may deem necessary to carry out the provisions of this article.

CHAPTER 14-09 - REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SUBDIVISION OF LAND
14-09-01. Planning Commission.
1. The planning commission of the City of Bismarck is hereby authorized and instructed to review and approve or disapprove the formal subdivision of land within its jurisdiction.
2. The territorial jurisdiction of the city planning commission over the subdivision or platting of land shall include all land located within the corporate limits, and all land lying within the extraterritorial jurisdiction as defined in Section 14-02-03 hereof.
(Ord. 5278, 09-23-03)
14-09-02. Purpose of Subdivision Regulations; Approval of Plats. As each new subdivision of land in the City becomes a permanent unit in the basic structure of the expanding community, to which the community will be forced to adhere, the design and arrangement of such subdivisions must correlate to the unified scheme of community interests. In order to provide for the proper arrangement of streets in relation to other existing and planned streets, and to the master plan of the City of Bismarck; to provide for adequate and convenient open spaces, for recreation, for light and air; in order to avoid congestion of population; in order to provide for traffic, for utilities, for access of fire-fighting apparatus; in order to promote, preserve and enhance area natural resources; in order to provide for and improve the public health, safety and general welfare of the City of Bismarck, the following rules and regulations for the platting and subdivision of land within the City of Bismarck and adjacent territory have been adopted by the Planning Commission of the City of Bismarck, in accordance with the laws of the State of North Dakota and the ordinances of the City of Bismarck.
Every piece of land proposed within the City or within the City's extraterritorial area shall be prepared, presented for approval and recorded as described in this Chapter. This chapter applies to the platting of land into a single parcel, the subdivision of a lot or parcel of land into two or more
Title 14 & 14.1 284
lots, or other division of land for the purpose of sale or development, whether immediate or future, including the resubdivision or replatting of lots. No plat of a subdivision of land within the City of Bismarck or within the adjacent territory designated on any filed master plan as subject to subdivision regulations of the City of Bismarck, shall be filed or recorded until it shall have been approved by the Planning Commission of the City of Bismarck and such approval entered in writing on the plat by the chairman and secretary of the City Planning Commission. Such subdivision plats must be prepared in accordance with provisions of Chapter 40-50 of the North Dakota Century Code. The filing of a plat of irregular description in accordance with Chapter 57-02-39 of the North Dakota Century Code does not meet the requirements of this Chapter.
(Ord. 4822, 02-25-97; Ord. 5146, 12-18-01)
14-09-03. Definitions. The following definitions represent the meanings of terms as they are used in these regulations:
Collector: Roadway which provides traffic movements between local roads and arterial roads and also provides direct access to abutting property. Collectors are often only two-lane roads but should be planned and designed to minimize on-street parking and direct driveway access. The locations of roadways classified as collectors shall be as designated on the most recent edition of the North Dakota Department of Transportation functional classification map.
Functional Classification: The process by which streets and highways are grouped into classes, or systems, according to the character of service they are intended to provide.
Ghost platting: A method of master planning for future urban densities in rural residential large-lot subdivisions located within the Urban Service Area Boundary (USAB). Platting for future urban densities is achieved by establishing lines for future splits of large lots into smaller lots and dedication of right-of-way and easements for future streets, utilities, storm water facilities etc. As the city grows and rural residential large-lot subdivisions are incorporated into the city, costs of public facility improvements can be shared among more users by planning ahead for conversion of rural residential subdivisions into urban density neighborhoods.
Interstate: Roadway which provides rapid movement of large traffic volumes between major population centers and other arterials. Interstates are multi-lane divided
Title 14 & 14.1 285
highways with grade separations at all crossroads, full access control and no parking. The locations of roadways classified as interstates shall be as designated on the most recent edition of the North Dakota Department of Transportation functional classification map.
Local: Roadway whose primary function is to provide access to abutting property. Local roads are usually two-lane roads with parking and direct access to adjacent lands.
Lot: As used in Section 14-09-01 and following of this ordinance shall mean a "record lot" as defined in Section 14-02-02 hereof unless otherwise stated.
Lot Combination: A combination of two (2) or more previously platted lots or parcels into a single lot whose boundaries coincide with the lot lines shown on the recorded plat of the subdivision.
Lot Line Adjustment: An administrative adjustment of an existing previously platted lot line between two (2) adjoining lots or parcels by relocation of a common boundary.
Lot Modification: A lot line adjustment, lot split or lot combination as defined herein.
Lot Split: The division of a previously platted lot or parcel into not more than three (3) lots or parcels.
Minor Arterial: Roadway which provides through traffic movements between areas and links collectors with other arterials. Minor arterials usually have two to four lanes and may be divided or undivided roads, preferably with little or no parking, and limited access. The locations of roadways classified as minor arterials shall be as designated on the most recent edition of the North Dakota Department of Transportation functional classification map.
Neighborhood Park: A park that typically serves the immediate residential areas within walking distance. Both passive and active park uses may be provided. Neighborhood parks do not typically have amenities that citizens would be drawn to drive to, but may include such features as part of a Park Development Agreement.
Title 14 & 14.1 286
Park Concept Development Plan: A conceptual plan of development of park and open space facilities for a particular property. Such plans may be developed for a subdivision plat or as part of a larger property that may be developed in phases and form the basis for subsequent subdivision plats.
Park Development Agreement: A written agreement between the Bismarck Parks and Recreation District and an owner and/or developer of land within the planning and zoning jurisdiction of the City of Bismarck. Such agreements shall be in accordance with the latest adopted City policy and shall include provisions for the transfer of property to the Park District for the purpose of development of park and open space facilities and the obligations of all parties pursuant to the provisions of the agreement.
Plat of Irregular Description: A plat made for taxation purposes at the request of the County Auditor in accordance with Section 57-02-39 NDCC. Such a County Auditor's plat is not platting pursuant to Chapter 40-50 NDCC, but rather is made for the convenience of tax officials in describing property on the tax rolls.
Principal Arterial: Roadway which provides for rapid movements of relatively large traffic volumes between large land areas, major traffic generators and other arterials. Principal arterials should have controlled access and are usually multi-lane roads with no parking. The locations of roadways classified as principal arterials shall be as designated on the most recent edition of the North Dakota Department of Transportation functional classification map.
Subdivision: The division of a tract or parcel of land into record lots for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or of building development, including any plat or plan which includes the creation of any part of one or more streets, public easements, or other rights-of-way, whether public or private, for access to or from such lots, and/or including the creation of new or enlarged parks, playgrounds, plazas or open spaces. However, the division of land for agricultural purposes into parcels of ten (10) or more acres not involving any new street or easement of access, shall be exempted from these regulations.
Subdivision Plat, Major: Any subdivision, platted pursuant to Chapter 40-50 NDCC, that does not meet the definition of a minor subdivision.
Title 14 & 14.1 287
Subdivision Plat, Minor: A subdivision, platted pursuant to Chapter 40-50 NDCC, that is part of a previously platted subdivision and does not include the dedication of new public rights-of-way.
(Ord. 4631, 08-30-94; Ord. 4735, 11-14-95; Ord. 5146, 12-18-01; Ord. 5279, 09-23-03; Ord. 5452, 08-23-05; Ord. 5539, 08-22-06; Ord. 5728, 05-26-09; Ord. 5819, 04-26-11; Ord. 6295, 12-12-17)

1. Pre-submittal Considerations for Major Subdivision Preliminary Plats and Minor Subdivision Final Plats.
a. Prior to preparing either a preliminary major subdivision plat or a minor subdivision plat for submittal, the applicant or applicant’s consulting engineer shall complete a pre-submittal scoping sheet for a post-construction stormwater management permit and submit it to the City Engineer in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 14.1-04 of the Code of Ordinances (Stormwater Management/Post-Construction Stormwater Management Permit).
b. Prior to preparing a subdivision plat for submittal, the applicant shall schedule a pre-application meeting with City staff to discuss the proposed plat, consistency of the plat with City policies and plans, the overall concept plan for the area, the extension of municipal utilities needed to service the plat (both route and funding expectations), compliance with the fringe area road master plan, any undevelopable land within or adjacent to the proposed plat, and any storm water management issues.
c. Prior to preparing a preliminary major subdivision plat for submittal, if the proposed plat is to include urban residential zoning, the applicant shall schedule a pre-application meeting with Bismarck Parks and Recreation District staff to discuss the proposed plat, consistency of the plat with Parks and Recreation District policies and plans, and the development of park and open spaces within the plat.
d. It is the duty of the Planning and Zoning Commission to discourage the subdividing of lands
Title 14 & 14.1 288
that are far in advance of the needs of the community; that by their location cannot be efficiently served by public utilities, fire protection, police protection or other municipal services; that are located in areas subject to flooding; that are located in areas that would adversely impact water quality and environmentally sensitive lands; that are topographically unsuitable for development; or that for any other reason are being unwisely or prematurely subdivided. It shall also be the duty of the planning commission to encourage the replatting of lands deemed to be unsatisfactorily subdivided or which represent an obstacle to the orderly and efficient growth of the city. It shall also be the duty of the planning commission to encourage the coordinated platting of adjacent parcels of land.
2. Major Subdivision Plat – Preliminary Plat (Tentative Approval):
a. An application for tentative approval of a major subdivision plat (preliminary plat) shall be submitted to the Director of Community Development by the specified application deadline and on the proper application form.

In any conditional approval, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require the property owner to submit a revised major subdivision preliminary plat. If disapproved, the reasons for that action shall be stated, and if possible, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall make recommendations on the basis of which the proposed subdivision may be approved.
g. The action of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be entered on the official records of the Planning and Zoning Commission, including any conditions imposed and the reasons for any disapproval of a major subdivision preliminary plat.
h. Tentative approval of a major subdivision preliminary plat by the Planning and Zoning Commission is not an acceptance of the major subdivision plat for record, but is rather an expression of approval of a general plat for the final approval and recording upon fulfillment of all requirements of these regulations.
i. Tentative approval shall be effective for a maximum period of twelve (12) months, unless upon application by the property owner, the Director of Community Development grants an extension. If the

f. Upon final approval of a major subdivision final plat involving the creation of new street(s); the widening, decreasing or vacation of existing street(s) or alley(s); the creation or modification of easements; or the creation, enlargement or decrease of other lands devoted to public use, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall at the same time and without further public hearing, approve such change in streets, alleys, easements or public lands as an amendment to the master plan. The Planning and Zoning Commission will transmit notice of such action to the Board of City Commissioners together with appropriate recommendations concerning the acceptance of dedicated streets and alleys, or the vacation thereof, and of the acceptance of easements and other dedicated lands. In the case of streets, alleys and public lands lying outside the City of Bismarck, notice of the action of the Planning and Zoning Commission and appropriate recommendations will be transmitted to the Board of County Commissioners of Burleigh County or other body
Title 14 & 14.1 295
having jurisdiction in order to procure approval of roadway dedications.
g. Final approval of a major subdivision final plat by the Planning and Zoning Commission shall in no way constitute legal acceptance of any dedicated streets, alleys or other public lands.
h. A major subdivision final plat that is recommended for approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission will be forwarded to the Board of City Commissioners. Following final approval of the major subdivision final plat and the Park Development Agreement or Park Concept Development Plan (if required) by the Board of City Commissioners, a plat in recordable form and all required ratifications shall be furnished to the Director of Community Development within one hundred eighty (180) days following approval. If the plat in recordable form and all required ratifications are not furnished to the Director of Community Development within one hundred eighty (180) days following approval, the approval of the plat shall be considered null and void and the applicant will have to reapply for approval.
Upon review and obtaining required signatures, and upon submittal of a final dwg file, the Director of Community Development shall file and record the original signed plat with the Burleigh County Recorder.

Title 14 & 14.1 302
1. Streets and alleys:
a. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to the master plan and shall be considered in relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, and to the proposed uses of lands to be served thereby.
b. Where it is now shown on the master plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
1. Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing arterial and collector streets in surrounding areas; or
2. Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the planning commission to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance of or conformance to existing streets impractical.
c. Local streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic is discouraged.
d. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the planning commission shall limit access to the arterial street and may require reverse frontage of lots with a screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property lines, deep lots with rear services alleys, or other treatment that it deems advisable to limit such access and to give adequate protection to residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
e. Private streets are discouraged but may be permitted provided that the plat of any subdivision with private streets shall clearly establish or indicate private easements on such streets for the benefit of those who may become owners of lots in such subdivision, and further shall provide use of such private street easements to and for the use of any governmental subdivision, its officers and employees for utilities and any other governmental use or uses it deems necessary or advisable, provided the City shall not be responsible in any way to furnish any City services if such private street easements are not properly maintained or are obstructed by the owners of
Title 14 & 14.1 303
property in the subdivision. Private streets shall meet, at a minimum, the requirements of the most recent version of the International Fire Code (IFC) that has been adopted by the City and shall not become a maintenance liability for the City or County, depending on the location.

Article 5. Powers Reserved to the People
Section 1 - Referral of Ordinances. The citizens of Bismarck shall have the right to refer ordinances implementing home rule powers. Qualified city electors at least equal in number to ten per cent of the number of electors voting in the city for all candidates for the executive officer in the last election may, by referendum petition, suspend the operation of any ordinance enacted by the Board of City Commissioners, except emergency ordinances approved by at least four members of the Board of City Commissioners, ordinances upon which an election or a referendum has already been held pursuant to law or this charter, or ordinances which provide for meeting obligations of bonded indebtedness incurred by a prior ordinance or a prior election or referendum. An emergency ordinance shall contain a clause declaring an emergency and it shall become effective upon final passage.
Each petition shall have printed thereon: "Referral of City Ordinance ____), providing for
Home Rule Charter 8
__________" and shall accurately identify and summarize the nature of the ordinance, or portion of ordinance, being referred. In addition, each petition shall have listed the names of three electors who shall constitute the "Committee for the Petitioners" and who shall represent and act for the petitioners. At the bottom of each petition, the circulator of the petition shall sign an affidavit affirming that the signers are known to be qualified electors of the city.
The City Attorney, or other official designated by ordinance, shall pass upon the form of each petition and, if the City Attorney, or other official designated by ordinance, finds it insufficient, the City Attorney, or other official designated by ordinance, shall notify the "Committee for the Petitioners" and allow five work days for correction or amendment.

Referendum petitions shall be filed with the City Auditor, or other official designated by ordinance, not later than 60 days after adoption of the ordinance.
If a referendum petition is filed against an emergency ordinance, the ordinance shall be in effect until voted upon by the electors. If the emergency ordinance is rejected by a majority of the votes cast thereon, it shall be repealed as of the tenth calendar day after the election.
Each ordinance referred to the electors shall be placed upon the ballot by the City Auditor, or other official designated by ordinance, at the next election occurring 60 days after the filing of sufficient petitions, or at a special election called by the Board of City Commissioners, whichever shall occur first.
The City Auditor, or other official designated by ordinance, shall publish each referred ordinance once each week for two consecutive weeks prior to the election in the official city newspaper. The notice shall include the date of the election, the hours of the election, and a list of the polling places.

Section 2 - Initiative. A petition to initiate an
Home Rule Charter 9
ordinance shall be presented to the City Attorney, or other official designated by ordinance, for approval as to form prior to circulation.

If the City Attorney, or other official designated by ordinance, does not approve the petition because it is not in the proper form or because it does not contain the full text of the measure, the City Attorney, or other official designated by ordinance, shall give written notice to the Committee for the Petitioners of the reason for not approving their petition.
Any proposed ordinance may be submitted to the Board of City Commissioners by a petition signed by qualified electors at least equal in number to fifteen percent of the number of electors voting in the City for all candidates for the executive officer at the last election. The petition shall be filed in the office of the City Auditor, or other official designated by ordinance, and shall contain a request that the ordinance set out in the petition be submitted to a vote of the qualified electors of the City if it is not passed by the governing body of the city.
After receiving the petition for the initiation of a proposed ordinance, the Board of City Commissioners shall:
a. pass the ordinance without alteration within thirty (30) calendar days after the attachment of the certificate of the City Auditor, or other official designated by ordinance, to the accompanying petition that it appears in order; or
b. direct the City Auditor, or other official designated by ordinance, to place the proposed initiated ordinance upon the ballot at the next election occurring after 60 days after the filing of sufficient petitions, or at a special election called by the Board, whichever shall occur first.

The initiated ordinance shall take effect 30 days after approval by the voters unless a different effective date is stated in the ordinance. The Board of City Commissioners may not repeal or make any material amendment to an initiated ordinance except by vote of all members for a period of five (5) years after the date of the election adopting the ordinance, but an initiated ordinance may be amended at any time by an initiated amendment. Thereafter, the ordinance may be repealed or amended the same as any ordinance. An initiated ordinance approved by the Board of City Commissioners without being submitted to the electors may be referred as provided in Section 1.
