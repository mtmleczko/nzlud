PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the ordinances of Bay Village, Ohio of a general and permanent nature. The Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    The source of each section is included in the history note which appears in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate all laws and ordinances included herein. 
    The various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant state laws have been included. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in the original Code. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a period, the figure before the period referring to the chapter number and the figure after the period referring to the position of the section within the chapter. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept-up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.

WILL OF IDA MARIE CAHOON 
Editor's note- Following are parts of the will of Ida Maria Cahoon, dated June 16, 1917, concerning Bay Village. 
ITEM TWENTIETH: I give, devise and bequeath to Emma Paul Pope and Olive Paul Bailey of the Village of Bay, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, in equal portions share and share alike during their natural lives and to the survivor during her natural life the use of the following described real estate being the house and lot where they now reside bounded as follows: On the south by the south line of lot number ninety-five (95); on the west by the center of the Cahoon Road, on the north by a line parallel with the south line of said lot number ninety-five (95) and ten (10) feet north of the dwelling house now standing on said land; and on the west by a line parallel to the Cahoon Road and easterly therefrom to the place where the level land meets the top of the bank of the Cahoon Creek. At the death of both said Emma Paul Pope and Olive Paul Bailey the land in this item described shall become a part of the Cahoon Memorial Park as in item twenty-one (21) hereinafter provided. 
ITEM TWENTY-ONE: I give, devise and bequeath to the Mayor and Council of the Village of Bay, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and their successors in office in trust for the citizens, people and Village of Bay the following described real estate situated in the Village of Bay, County of Cuyahoga and State of Ohio, and known as being all of original lot number ninety-five (95) owned by me at the time of my decease and not hereinbefore or hereafter disposed of, (together with the land and real estate described in Item 20 after the death of both Emma Paul Pope and Olive Paul Bailey) said land and real estate in this Item of my will named shall be forever used as a park for the citizens and Village of Bay and shall be forever known and named Cahoon Memorial Park in honor of the member of the Cahoon family which made the first settlement in the township of Dover, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, at this place on October 10, 1810, to have and to hold said land and property in this Item named to said Mayor and Council and their successors in office forever under the trust herein provided. 
    I hereby direct that the dwelling house now standing on said land and which was built in 1818, shall be forever maintained and used as a Library and Museum. 
    The income from the cultivated land and from the houses and buildings on said real estate shall be expended yearly in keeping in order and improving the Park and buildings standing on said real estate. 
    This gift to the Mayor and Council of the Village of Bay is made with the following conditions; 
    That said Park shall at all times be properly policed. 
    That no boating, bathing, games or sports shall be permitted on said Park or property on Sunday. 
    That no intoxicating liquors shall ever be bought, sold or used upon said premises nor shall gambling in any form be permitted or allowed thereon. 
    The Lakeside Cemetery situated west of said land on lots numbers ninety-three (93) and Ninety-four (94) in the Village of Bay, in which lie buried many early settlers, is to be sacredly cared for and if need be, protected upon the North by stone wall, but never to be removed from its present location. 
    If any one of these conditions be violated or said Mayor or Village Council refuse to accept said trust, then and in that event, I give, devise and bequeath the land and real estate, in this item named and described to the Board of Trustees of the School Teachers Pension Fund of Cleveland, Ohio, and their successors in office forever in trust to said Trustees, their successors in office forever as a home for the use of the retired teachers of the public schools of the City of Cleveland, Ohio. 
ITEM TWENTY-THREE deals with sale of property and directing Cleveland Trust Co., trustee to dispose of as follows. 
ITEM TWENTY-FOUR: I hereby authorize and direct by said trustee, The Cleveland Trust Company, to receive from my said executor the residue of the proceeds of my estate as provided in Item 23, of this by said will upon the trust hereafter named and provided, that my said trustee divide said trust fund into two equal parts and that said trustee invest and reinvest said two equal parts in such good, safe and interest bearing securities as shall seem best to it. And that one of said funds shall be known as the Cahoon Memorial Park Fund and that the other fund shall be known as the "Library of Dover by the Lake Fund ". 
    I hereby authorize and direct said trustee to pay to the Mayor and Council of the Village of Bay, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and their successors in office, or their duly authorized agent the net income from the Cahoon Memorial Park Fund, quarterly, or as shall be agreed between said trustee and the Mayor and the Council of the Village of Bay, which said income shall be used by the Mayor and Council aforesaid, for the purpose of maintaining and beautifying said Cahoon Memorial Park and for the expense of caring for, guarding and protecting said park. 
    I further direct that the income from the "Library of Dover by the Lake Fund" as hereinbefore provided shall be paid over to the Mayor and Council of said Village of Bay and their successors in office or their duly appointed agent, as soon and whenever a library is established in the Cahoon Homestead. 
    And that said income shall be used to buy books, maintain, support and care for said library. I further direct that if the Mayor and Council of the Village of Bay or their successors, in office refuse to accept the trust as provided in Item 21 of this Will, or violate the provisions of said trust, so that the property therein named goes to or reverts to the Board of Trustees of the School Teachers' Pension Fund of Cleveland, Ohio, then and in that event, I direct that my said trustee herein named pay the income of said Funds to the said Board of Trustees of the School Teachers' Pension Fund of Cleveland, Ohio, to be used for the support and maintenance of said home for the retired teachers of the public schools, of the City of Cleveland, Ohio. 
ITEM TWENTY-FIVE: I hereby direct and request that steps be taken by said Mayor and Council of the Village of Bay to enlist the attention of Mr. Andrew Carnegie and solicit his help and assistance in establishing and maintaining said library. 
    I hereby give and bequeath to the "Library of Dover by the Lake", herein intended to be created, all my books, pictures and I request that the family portraits and best pictures be placed therein on the walls of said Cahoon Homestead, and be forever maintained therein. 
    I do hereby authorize and empower and direct the Mayor and Council of the Village of Bay, and their successors in office to cause the buildings on said Cahoon Memorial Park property to be insured in reliable and responsible insurance companies, and pay the premiums therefor out of the income of the Cahoon Memorial Park Fund as hereinbefore provided.

The estimate shall give the following information: 
(a)  An estimate of the anticipated revenue from each source during the next succeeding fiscal year, with a comparative statement of the amount received from such source during the preceding one or two years and the current year plus an estimate of such amounts for the remainder of the current year, which estimates he shall receive from the Director of Finance.

The Council shall adopt such ordinance in its original form or with such revision as it may find proper within such time as is fixed by general law, or not more than one hundred eighty (180) days after the beginning of the fiscal year covered by said ordinance, in case no such time is fixed. Such appropriation ordinance shall be in such form and detail as may be required by the general laws of Ohio, and may be amended or supplemented by the Council after its passage, but appropriations shall not be made in excess of the estimated revenues of the Municipality. The Council may make preliminary appropriation for current expenses sufficient in amount to meet the current needs until the annual appropriation ordinance has been enacted and is in effect. The passage of any ordinance authorizing the issue or sale of bonds or notes of the Municipality shall constitute an appropriation of the proceeds thereof to the purposes for which said bonds or notes are issued. 
SECTION 9.3 - TRANSFERS AND BALANCES. 
    The Council may transfer any part of an unencumbered balance of an appropriation of any fund, to any purpose or object for which the appropriation for the current year has proved insufficient, or may authorize a transfer of moneys to be made between items appropriated to the same office or department, except as follows: 
(a)  No transfer shall be made from any bond or note fund, except that the unexpended balance of such fund no longer needed for the purpose for which said fund was created shall be transferred to the fund from which said bonds or notes are to be paid. 
(b)  No transfer shall be made of moneys raised or appropriated for the payment of any bond or note of the Municipality, until all indebtedness, interest and other obligations which can lawfully be paid from such moneys have been paid. 
    At the close of each fiscal year the unencumbered balance of each appropriation, except appropriations to bond or note funds or any other trust or special fund which the Council by law or this Charter shall be authorized to create, shall revert to the fund from which it was appropriated, and shall be subject to future appropriation. 
SECTION 9.4 - PAYMENT OF CLAIMS.

Each head of a department and his surety shall be liable to the Municipality for all loss and damage sustained by the Municipality by reason of the unfaithful approval of any claim against the Municipality in his department. The Director of Finance shall have power to require evidence that the amount of the claim is justly due and is in conformity to law and ordinance, and for that purpose he may summon before him any officer, agent or employee of any department of this Municipality, and examine him upon oath or affirmation relative thereto. 
SECTION 9.5 - CUSTODY AND DEPOSIT OF FUNDS. 
    The Council shall by ordinance provide for the custody of all funds of the Municipality and for the deposit of funds in a bank or banks.

SECTION 9.6 - CERTIFICATION OF EXPENDITURES. 
    No contract, agreement or other obligation involving the expenditures of moneys shall be entered into, nor shall any ordinance, resolution or order for the expenditure of moneys be passed or issued by the Council, or be authorized by any officer of the Municipality, unless the Director of Finance shall have first certified in writing to the Council, or to the proper officer, as the case may be, that the money required for such contract, agreement, obligation or expenditure is in the Treasury to the credit of the fund from which it is to be drawn and not appropriated for any other purpose. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to prevent the making of contracts for a period extending beyond a single fiscal year when such contracts are otherwise authorized by this Charter or by general law. All moneys actually in the Treasury to the credit of the fund from which they are to be drawn, and all moneys applicable to the payment of the obligation or appropriation involved, that are anticipated to come into the Treasury before the maturity of such contract, agreement or obligation, from taxes, assessments, license fees, or from sales of service, products, or by-products of any municipal undertaking, and moneys to be derived from lawfully authorized bonds or notes, shall, for the purpose of such certificate, be deemed to be in the Treasury to the credit of the appropriate fund, and shall be subject to such certification. 
SECTION 9.7 - PUBLIC BIDDING. 
    The Council may authorize, in specific cases, expenditures of the funds of the Municipality in amounts exceeding that provided by State statute without public bidding for the acquisition of real estate, for the discharge of non-contractual claims against the Municipality, for personal services, for the joint use of facilities or exercise of powers with other political subdivisions or governmental bodies, for the product or services of public utilities (including those municipally operated), or in the case of a real and present emergency affecting the public peace, health, safety and welfare, but no other expenditures of more than that provided by State statute shall be made except pursuant to contract made with the lowest and best bidder after public advertising and receipt of bids in the manner provided by ordinance.

(a)  It is the policy of the City to promote a productive work environment and not to tolerate verbal or physical conduct by any employee that harasses, disrupts or interferes with another's work performance or that creates an intimidating, offensive or hostile environment. No form of harassment will be tolerated, including harassment for the following reasons: race, national origin, religion, disability, pregnancy, age, military status or sex. Each person has a responsibility to keep the workplace free of any form of harassment, and in particular, sexual harassment. No supervisor or manager is to threaten or insinuate either explicitly or implicitly that an employee's refusal or willingness to submit to sexual advances will affect the employee's terms or conditions of employment. Other sexually harassing or offensive conduct in the workplace, whether committed by supervisors, managers, non-supervisory or non-employees is also prohibited. This conduct includes, but is not limited to: 
(1)  Unwanted physical contact or conduct of any kind, including sexual flirtations, touching, advances or propositions; 
(2)  Verbal abuse of a sexual nature; 
(3)  Demeaning, insulting, intimidating, or sexually suggestive comments about an individual's dress or body; 
(4)  The display in the workplace of demeaning, insulting, intimidating, or sexually suggestive objects or pictures, including nude photographs; 
(5)  Demeaning, insulting, intimidating or sexually suggestive written, recorded, or electronically transmitted messages. 
    Any of the above conduct or offensive conduct, directed at individuals because of their race, national origin, religion, disability, pregnancy, age or military status or sexually orientation is also prohibited. 
    Any employee who believes that a supervisor's, manager's, other employee's or non-employee's actions or words constitute unwelcome harassment has a responsibility to report or complain about the situation as soon as possible. 
    The report or complaint should be made to the employee's supervisor or to the department head or personnel manager if the complaint involves the supervisor or manager. 
    Complaints of harassment are to be handled and investigated under the City's grievance policy, unless special procedures are considered appropriate. Regardless, all complaints of harassment are to be investigated properly in as impartial and confidential a manner as possible. Employees are required to cooperate in any investigation. A timely resolution of each complaint should be reached and communicated to the parties involved. Retaliation against any employee for filing a complaint or participating in an investigation is strictly prohibited. 
    Any employee, supervisor or manager who is found to have violated this harassment policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The City prohibits any form of retaliation against employees for bringing bona fide complaints or providing information of harassment. However, if an investigation of a complaint shows that the complaint or information was false, the individual who provided the false information will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
(b)  It is the policy of the City that an employee should have an opportunity to present complaints regarding harassment and to appeal the decision through a dispute resolution or grievance procedure. The City will attempt to resolve promptly all complaints. Employees who believe that they have been improperly harassed are to proceed as follows: 
Step 1: Promptly bring the complaint to the attention of the immediate supervisor. If the complaint involves the supervisor, then it is permissible to proceed directly to Step 2. Step 1a: The supervisor is to investigate the complaint, attempt to resolve it and give a decision to the employee within a reasonable time. The supervisor should prepare a written and dated summary of the complaint and proposed resolution for file purposes. Step 2: Appeal the decision of the department head if dissatisfied with the supervisor's decision or initiate the procedure with the department head if Step 1 has been bypassed, because the immediate supervisor is the subject of complaint. Such an appeal or initial complaint must be made in a timely fashion in a written form. The supervisor's version of the complaint and decision will then be submitted in writing as well. The department head will, in a timely fashion, confer with the employee, supervisor, and any other persons considered appropriate; investigate the issues; and communicate a decision in writing to all parties involved. Step 3: Appeal an unsatisfactory department head decision to the Mayor. The timeliness requirement and the procedures to be followed are similar to those in Step 2. The Mayor may take the necessary steps to review and investigate the complaint and will then issue a written, final and binding decision.  
    Final decisions on complaints will not be precedent or binding on future complaints. 
    When appropriate, the decisions will be retroactive to the date of the employee's original complaint. Information concerning a complaint is to be held in confidence. Supervisors, department heads and other persons who investigate a grievance are to discuss it only with those individuals who have a need to know about it or who are needed to supply necessary background information or advice. 
    Employees are not to be penalized for proper use of the complaint procedure, however, it is not considered proper use if an employee raises complaints in bad faith if solely for the purpose of delay or harassment or repeatedly raises meritless grievance complaints. Implementation of the complaint procedure by an employee does not limit the right of the City to proceed with any disciplinary action which is not in retaliation for the complaint procedure. The City may, at its discretion, refuse to proceed with any complaint it determines is improper under this policy.

    Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not exceed a fine of $150.00. Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the defendant: 
(a)  Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six months, or 
(b)  Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty prescribed is a fine greater than $150.00 and/or imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto." 
    In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due process clause of the United States Constitution. 
    The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases. Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v. Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v. Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality." 
    The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court, continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date." 
    Rule l3 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required to make payments under subsection (b)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar quarter. 
(2)  If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. The payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this subsection does not affect an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this section. 
(3)  An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax Administrator.

(4)  An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to withhold City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's successor entity. 
(5)  a.  An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.

(6)  Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed. 
(7)  Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator. 
(8)  On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator listing:

The dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due. 
(10)  An employer is required to deduct and withhold City income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this subsection, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means. 
(11)  The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the purposes of this section.

The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this subsection shall be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the purposes of this section. For the purposes of this subsection, the location at which an employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with subsection (C)(2)(b) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that subsection.

(3)  If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from withholding requirements described in subsection (c)(2)(a) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in that subsection, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages to that municipal corporation.

(5)  If an employer's fixed location is the City and the employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section 182.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the City, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the corporate boundaries of the City.

(6)  Subsections (c)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section 182.04.

182.14 - Service of assessment. 
(a)  As used in this section: 
(1)  Last known address means the address the Tax Administrator has at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC. 
(2)  Undeliverable address means an address to which the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the assessment. 
(b)  Subject to subsection (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail. 
(c)  b.  Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under subsection (c)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served. 
(2)  If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the following statement: 
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed apply from and after that date." 
    Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served. 
    If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under subsection (c)(1)(a) of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under this subsection in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. 
(d)  (1)  A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under subsection (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment.

307.04 - Release of vehicle; records; charges. 
Editor's note- The provisions of former Section 307.04 as amended are now codified in Section 307.02. 
307.05 - Leaving junk and other vehicles on private or public property without permission or notification. 
    No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk motor vehicle" as defined in Section 307.09 on private property for more than 72 consecutive hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of any road or highway, for 48 consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place. 
    For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment. Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality. 
(ORC 4513.64) 
307.06 - Leaving junk vehicles on private property with permission of owner. 
    For the purposes of this section, junk motor vehicle means any motor vehicle meeting the requirements of Section 307.09(b) to (e) that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than 72 hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12; or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle. 
    Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's vehicle stored in the open. 
    The Chief of Police may send notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the property. 
    No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of 30 days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate offense.

A.  Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk. 
B.  Other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(3)  A.

B.  Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop sign. 
(2)  A.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is displayed. 
B.  When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.

An offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant. 
B.  Public servant has the same meaning as in Section 525.01. 
(d)  An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct, the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first. 
(e)  A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue and execute process on the same.

(j)  This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the Municipal income tax ordinance. 
501.07 - Requirements for criminal liability. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply: 
(1)  The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is capable of performing; 
(2)  The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the offense. 
(b)  When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability. 
(c)  (1)  When language defining an element of an offense that is related to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts recklessly. 
(2)  Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined in the Traffic Code. 
(3)  Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition incorporated into the offense. 
(d)  Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged. 
(e)  As used in this section: 
(1)  Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession. 
(2)  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's volition, are involuntary acts. 
(3)  Culpability means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence, as defined in Section 501.08. 
(4)  Intoxication includes, but is not limited to, intoxication resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
(ORC 2901.21) 
501.08 - Culpable mental states. 
(a)  A person acts purposely when it is the person's specific intention to cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby, it is the offender's specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature. 
(b)  A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is aware that the person's conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
    When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact. 
(c)  A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the person's conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist. 
(d)  A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person's conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may exist. 
(e)  When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element. 
(ORC 2901.22) 
501.09 - Attempt. 
(a)  No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense. 
(b)  It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect, commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to be. 
(c)  No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in violation of this section. 
(d)  It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the actor abandoned the actor's effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of the actor's criminal purpose. 
(e)  Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under this section. 
(f)  As used in this section, drug abuse offense has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02) 
501.10 - Complicity. 
(a)  No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense, shall do any of the following: 
(1)  Solicit or procure another to commit the offense; 
(2)  Aid or abet another in committing the offense; 
(3)  Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense. 
(b)  It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender. 
(c)  No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section 501.09. 
(d)  If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following: 
"The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution. 
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and worth or its lack of quality and worth." 
(e)  It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that, prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose. 
(f)  Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this section, or in terms of the principal offense. 
(ORC 2923.03) 
501.11 - Organizational criminal liability. 
(a)  An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the following circumstances: 
(1)  The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of the officer's, agent's or employee's office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply. 
(2)  A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of the officer's, agent's or employee's office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply. 
(3)  The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty imposed by law on the organization. 
(4)  If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded, tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or employment. 
(b)  If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the contrary plainly appears. 
(c)  In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of the section defining the offense. 
(d)  As used in this section, organization means a corporation for profit or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. 
(ORC 2901.23) 
501.12 - Personal accountability for organizational conduct. 
(a)  An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section 501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense, and any of the following apply: 
(1)  In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct responsibility; 
(2)  He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged. 
(b)  When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. 
(ORC 2901.24) 
501.13 - Conspiracy. 
(a)  No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson, arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs, or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio R.C.

(2)  Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified offenses. 
(b)  No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the accused's entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed. 
(c)  When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring with that other person, even though the other person's identity may be unknown to the offender. 
(d)  It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect, commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible under the circumstances. 
(e)  A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed. 
(f)  A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship. 
(g)  When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the same offense. 
(h)  (1)  No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence. 
(2)  If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court, when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following: 
"The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not become inadmissible because of the accomplice's complicity, moral turpitude, or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect the witness' credibility and make the witness' testimony subject to grave suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution. 
It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and worth or its lack of quality and worth."

(j)  Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree. 
(k)  This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code, other than this section. In such a case, however: 
(1)  With respect to the offense specified as the object of the conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the conspiracy; 
(2)  Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code. 
(l)  (1)  In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C. 2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2981.06.

501.99 - Penalties for misdemeanors.

In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions authorized under this section. If the court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Restitution. Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim. 
    If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from the offender. 
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18. 
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five percent of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments. 
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate. 
(2)  Fines. A fine in the following amount: 
A.  For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $1,000.00; 
B.  For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750.00; 
C.  For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500.00; 
D.  For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250.00; 
E.  For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.00. 
(3)  Reimbursement of costs of sanctions. 
A.  Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the following: 
1.  All or part of the costs of implementing any community control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;

B.  The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section. (ORC 2929.28)

The value of the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series. 
(2)  If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section 545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section 545.05, 545.06 or 545.08, Section 545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section 545.15 or 545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.

(3)  In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender's same employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection (b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution. 
(c)  The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of property or services involved in a theft offense: 
(1)  The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique, museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss. 
(2)  The value of personal effects and household goods, and of materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business, trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind and quality. 
(3)  The value of any real or personal property that is not covered under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act. 
(d)  Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the value of property or services involved in a theft offense: 
(1)  When the property involved is personal property held for sale at wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima-facie evidence of its value. 
(2)  When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price, given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the security or commodity. 
(3)  When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of the livestock, poultry or products. 
(4)  When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument. 
(5)  When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading, pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument. 
(6)  When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument. 
(7)  When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone, transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the services. 
(8)  When the services involved are services for which the rate is not established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders, the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the services. 
(ORC 2913.61) 
545.03 - Property exceptions as felony offense. 
    Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions of Section 545.05 or 545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following: 
(a)  A credit card;

Within nine months of the promulgation of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, this chapter shall be amended to require compliance by Dischargers with such standards within the time frame prescribed by such standards. Where a Discharger, subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, has not previously submitted a disclosure form as required by Section 912A.05(b)(2), the Discharger shall file a disclosure form with the Control Authority within 180 days after the promulgation of the Applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard by the U.S. EPA. In addition, any Discharger operating on the basis of a previous filing of a disclosure statement, shall submit to the Control Authority within 180 days after the promulgation of an applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the additional information required by paragraphs H. and I. of Section 912A.05(b)(2). The Discharger shall be informed of any proposed changes in this chapter at least 30 days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in this chapter shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. 
(c)  Reporting requirements for discharger. 
(1)  Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance by the Discharger with applicable Pretreatment Standards set forth in this chapter or 90 days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the Rocky River WWTP by a new Discharger, any Discharger subject to this chapter shall submit to the Control Authority a report indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. The report shall state whether the applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional OM&R and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the Discharger into compliance with the applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements. This statement shall be signed as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this Section, and by a qualified engineer (licensed to practice in the State of Ohio). In addition to the above required information, for Industrial Dischargers subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of such Discharger's long term production rate. For all other Industrial Dischargers subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the Discharger's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. 
(2)  Periodic compliance reports. 
A.  Any Discharger subject to Individual Wastewater Discharge Permits, after the effective date of such Permits, shall submit to the Control Authority according to the schedule included in the Permits, a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by the Pretreatment Standards as set forth in the Permits. In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the Discharger must submit documentation required by the Control Authority or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the User. 
    In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period reported in Section 912A.05(c)(l), hereof. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided however, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the Control Authority may accept reports of average and maximum flow estimated by verifiable techniques. The Control Authority, for good cause shown considering such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, or other extenuating factors may authorize the submission of said reports on months other than those specified above. This report shall be signed as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this Section. 
B.  Reports of Dischargers shall contain all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where required by the Control Authority. The frequency of monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed by the Pretreatment Coordinator and set forth in the Individual Wastewater Discharge Permits. All sampling and analyses shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard. (Comment: Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator of the U.S. EPA.) 
C.  If sampling performed by an Industrial Discharger indicates a violation, the Discharger shall notify the Control Authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The Discharger shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Control Authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except the Industrial Discharger is not required to resample if: 
l.  The Control Authority performs sampling at the Industrial Discharger at a frequency of at least once per month, or 
2.  The Control Authority performs sampling at the Discharger between the time when the Discharger performs its initial sampling and the time when the Discharger receives the results of this sampling. 
D.  Sampling . Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
l.  Except as indicated in Section 2 and 3 below, the User must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Control Authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Control Authority, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Control Authority, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with Instantaneous Limits. 
2.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
3.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in (b) and (c)(1) [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Control Authority may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs (c)(2) (40 CFR 403.l2(e) and 403.12(h)), the Industrial User is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. 
E.  Monitoring waiver. The Control Authority may authorize the Industrial User subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical Pretreatment Standard if the Industrial User has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the Discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the Industrial User. This Monitoring Waiver authorization is subject to the conditions in 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2) through (e)(3)(iv). 
(3)  Notification of changed discharge. All Industrial Dischargers shall promptly notify the Control Authority in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the Industrial User has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p). 
(4)  Signatory requirements for industrial discharge reports. The reports required by paragraphs (h)(2), (c)(l) and (c)(2) of this Section shall include the following certified statement: 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
    In addition, said reports shall be signed as follows: 
A.  By a responsible corporate officer, if the industrial Discharger submitting the reports required by paragraphs (h)(2), (c)(1), and (c)(2), of this Section is a corporation. For the purpose of this paragraph, a responsible corporate officer means (i) a president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-president of the corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar policy or decision-making functions for the corporation, or (ii) the manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or operation facilities employing more than 250 persons or having gross annual sales or expenditures exceeding $25,000,000.00 (in second-quarter 1980 dollars), if authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in accordance with corporate procedures, and if the manager has been assigned or delegated authority to make management decisions that govern the operation of the regulated facility, including having the explicit or implicit duty of making major capital investment recommendations, and of initiating and directing other comprehensive measures to assure long-term environmental compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and if the manager is responsible for ensuring that the necessary systems are established or that the necessary actions are taken to gather complete and accurate information for the requirements of Pretreatment Standards, Individual permits, Local Limits, including BMP' s and General Control Mechanisms,

3.  The written authorization is submitted to the Control Authority. 
D.  If an authorization under paragraph (c)(4)C. of this section is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company a new authorization satisfying the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)C. of this section must be submitted to the Control Authority prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative. 
(d)  General control mechanisms. 
(1)  At the discretion of the Control Authority, the Control Authority may use general control mechanisms to control SIU discharges to the POTW if the following conditions are met. All facilities to be covered by a general control mechanism must: 
A.  Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations; 
B.  Discharge the same types of wastes; 
C.  Require the same effluent limitations; 
D.  Require the same or similar monitoring; and 
E.  ln the opinion of the Control Authority, are more appropriately controlled under a general control mechanism than under individual wastewater discharge permits. 
(2)  To be covered by the general control mechanism, the SIU must file a written request for coverage that identifies its contact information, production processes, the types of wastes generated, the location for monitoring all wastes covered by the general control mechanism, any requests in accordance with Section 912A.05(c)(2) for a Monitoring Waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the Discharge, and any other information the POTW deems appropriate. A Monitoring Waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge is not effective in the general control mechanism until after the Control Authority has provided written notice to the SIU that such a waiver request has been granted in accordance with Section 912A.05(c)(2). 
(3)  The Control Authority will retain a copy of the general control mechanism, documentation to support the POTW' s determination that a specific SIU meets the criteria in Section (d)(1) above and applicable State regulations, and a copy of the SIU's written request for coverage for three years after the expiration of the general control mechanism. 
(4)  The Control Authority may not control an SIU through a general control mechanism where the facility is subject to production based categorical Pretreatment Standards or categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed as mass of pollutant discharged per day or for SIUs whose limits are based on the Combined Wastestream Formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)) or Net/Gross calculations (40 CFR 403.15). 
(e)  Monitoring facilities. 
(1)  Each Discharger shall provide and operate at the Discharger's own expense, a monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of each sewer discharge to the Control Authority. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the Discharger's premises, except where such location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the Discharger, the City may concur with the facility being constructed in the public street or sidewalk area providing that the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(2)  There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the Discharger. 
(3)  All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 120 days of receipt of permit by Discharger.

Cross reference- Repair and maintenance of service lines-see S. & P. S. Ch. 915. Sewer rental-see S. & P.S. Ch. 921. 

913.01 - Sanitary sewer line connection. 
    Whenever any new structure shall be hereafter constructed in the City upon a lot or parcel of land, any portion of which abuts upon a street containing a public sanitary sewer line, the sanitary disposal system of such structure shall be connected to and flow into the sewer line in such manner as may be approved by the Director of Public Service and Properties. 
(Ord. 14-60. Passed 6-9-14.) 
913.02 - Storm sewer line connection. 
    Whenever any new structure shall be hereafter constructed in the City upon a lot or parcel of land, any portion of which abuts upon a street containing a public storm sewer line, the storm water disposal system of the structure shall be connected to and flow into the sewer line in such manner as may be approved by the Director of Public Service and Properties. 
(Ord. 14-60. Passed 6-9-14.) 
913.03 - Approval on sanitary sewer line 
    Whenever any structure shall have been heretofore constructed in the City upon a lot or parcel of land any portion of which abuts upon a street containing a public sanitary sewer line, the Director of Public Service and Properties may, for the protection of public health, safety and welfare, order the sanitary disposal system of the structure connected to and flow into the sewer line in such manner as may be approved by him. 
(Ord. 14-60. Passed 6-9-14.) 
913.04 - Approval on storm sewer line. 
    Whenever any structure shall have been constructed heretofore in the City upon a lot or parcel of land any portion of which abuts upon a street containing a public storm sewer line, the Director of Public Service and Properties may, for the protection of public health, safety and welfare, order the storm sewer disposal system of the structure connected to and flow into the sewer line in such manner as may be approved by him. 
(Ord. 14-60. Passed 6-9-14.) 
913.05 - Tap-in fee. 
    The charge for an initial tap-in connection to the City sanitary sewer system or for an increase of sanitary flow caused by an expansion or change of use shall be as follows: 
(a)  Residential: $1,000.00 per dwelling unit. 
(b)  Restaurant: Less than 2,000 square foot, $2,250.00; each additional square foot 0.50. 
(c)  Office buildings, retail and commercial and all others: Less than 2,000 square foot, $1,000.00; each additional square foot 0.25. 
    The Chief Building Official will be responsible for determination of the tap-in fee calculation and approved by the Director of Finance. Existing uses that are being demolished/removed from service due to re-development will be used in the calculation. For example, if a re-development project proposes 30 units of residential and five existing units are being demolished, the tap-in fee will be based on 25 units. Other re-development projects will also take into account demolition of existing buildings. 
    These tap-in fees are for the ability to "tap-in" to the City's sewer system. They do not cover the construction cost for the tap-in. The private sector will be solely responsible for an approved contractor installing the connections with the City Inspector reviewing and approving the implementation of the project. The Director of Public Service will oversee any and all fees involved with City crews conducting any work at the site. The tap-in fees will not cover the cost of having a City Inspector at the site reviewing and approving the connection; such fees will be billed hourly as incurred with such fees as established by the Director of Finance. 
    The funds received from the collection of such charges shall be kept in a separate and distinct fund which shall be known as the Sewer fund. The Sewer Fund shall be used for the payment of the cost of management, maintenance, operation and repair of the City's sewerage systems, which includes both storm and sanitary sewers, sewage pumping stations and treatment and disposal works. 
(Ord. 14-60. Passed 6-9-14.) 
913.06 - Tap-in fee in lieu of assessment. 
    Wherever public sanitary sewers, storm sewers or water lines have been constructed, and the cost thereof has been wholly or partly paid out of the funds of the City, or the cost thereof has been partially or wholly assessed against property, and the owner of any abutting property makes application for permit to tap into any such sewer or water line, no permit shall be issued to any such abutting owner if for any reason no assessment has been levied against the property for which the tap is sought, unless such person shall first pay into the City Treasury a sum equal to an amount paid by the City or assessed against similarly situated properties for the cost of constructing such sewers and/or water lines into which he desires to tap. 
(Ord. 14-60. Passed 6-9-14.) 
913.07 - Notice to make connection. 
    Whenever either a storm sewer or a sanitary sewer or both are available for connection to any lot or parcel of land, the Director of Public Service and Properties shall cause written notice to be given to the owner of such lot or parcel of land to which such connections are to be made, which notice shall state the number and character of the connections required The notice under this section shall he served by the Clerk of Council upon the owners of the lots or parcels of land to which such connections are to be made, by certified mail addressed to such owner at his last known address, or to the address to which tax hills are sent. If it appears by the return of the certified mail notice, or otherwise, that one or more of such owners cannot be found, such owners shall be served by publication of the notice once in a newspaper of general circulation within the City. The returned receipt for notice forwarded by certified mail, accepted by the addressee or anyone purporting to act for him, shall be prima-facie evidence of the service of notice under this section.

913.10 - Test of sewer connections authorized. 
    The Director of Public Service and Properties, or any employee of the City designated by him, may enter on any lot or parcel of land and open any test tee thereon to determine whether or not any sewer or sewer connection is blocked on the lot or parcel of land or in the public street in front of the same, and to determine whether the sewer lines are connected to the proper sewer. 
(Ord. 14-60. Passed 6-9-14.) 
913.11 - Corrective order and expenses therefor. 
    If investigations and tests reveal that downspouts, street drains or any surface waters flow into any sanitary sewer, the Director of Public Service and Properties shall order the abatement of such condition. Such order shall require connection of downspouts, yard drains and any other collectors of surface water to flow into the available storm sewer within 60 days. The Director is authorized to require immediate disconnection of any downspout which is found flowing into a sanitary sewer, and such downspout shall be discharged onto a splash box or other device, provided that no water so discharged flows onto adjoining property or over sidewalks.

Through the collection and analysis of wastewater samples from the sewer user and a review of water consumption, such City will calculate the extra-strength surcharge for these sewer users, and transmit these charges to the City Finance Director. The Finance Director will add the amount of the extra-strength surcharge to the normal user charge for that sewer user. All extra-strength surcharge revenue which is collected within a given user class will be credited to that user class and not comingled among other user classes. The extra-strength surcharge revenue will be credited to its particular user class prior to calculating the user charge for that user class for the upcoming year.

Chapter 1124 - CONDITIONAL USES 

1124.01 - Purpose. 
(a)  Conditional uses are a classification of uses that are determined to generally be compatible in the district in which they are listed as a conditional use. However, this category of uses is so classified because of the need to adequately monitor the proposed use in order to ensure that the use and its operational aspects are indeed appropriate in the specific location in which the use is proposed. Such monitoring is necessary because the external impacts of a particular use are either sufficiently varied or indeterminable in advance and therefore may vary from site to site, making it possible that, without the Planning Commission's review, a particular use could be inappropriate in a certain location within the district. 
(b)  These regulations are intended to ensure that conditional uses are reviewed in a reasonable and equitable manner, while safeguarding the property rights of all individuals and the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. Toward these ends, it is recognized that this Zoning Code should provide for more detailed evaluation of each use listed as a conditional use in a specific district with respect to such considerations as location, design, size, method(s) of operation, intensity of use, requirements for public facilities and traffic generation. In considering a proposed conditional use, the Planning Commission may assign reasonable requirements to ensure that the proposed development is appropriate in the location in which it is proposed. Accordingly, conditional use permits shall conform to the procedures and requirements of this Chapter and Chapter 1129. 
(Ord. 05-52. Passed 6-27-05.) 
1124.02 - Application and action by planning commission. 
    An application for a conditional use permit shall comply with Chapter 1129 and shall be submitted by the Building Director to the Planning Commission for approval. The Commission shall approve or disapprove the application within 60 days from the date of referral unless a different period of time is provided by Council. If the Commission fails to act within the time allotted, it shall be deemed to have approved such matter. The Planning Commission's disapproval may be appealed to Council as provided under Bay Village City Charter Section 7.4. 
(Ord. 05-52. Passed 6-27-05.) 
1124.03 - Standards for evaluating conditional use permits. 
    The Planning Commission shall determine, in approving a conditional use, that the proposed use will comply with the general standards in this Section 1124.03 pertinent to each use indicated therein. An application for a conditional use permit shall not be approved unless the following conditions and standards are complied with as set forth for the following districts: 
(a)  First and third residential districts. 
(1)  Minimum lot size of 2 acres. 
(2)  Front set back in first and third residential district not less than 50 feet but in no event not less than as shown for such lot on the Zone Map No. 2 of the City of Bay Village dated October 3, 1972, for buildings which were conforming, as well as nonconforming buildings, which were lawfully existing prior to the effective date of this section of the Zoning Code. 
(3)  Rear yard set back 30 feet abutting a residential district; ten feet abutting a commercial district. 
(4)  Side yard set back 30 feet abutting a residential district; ten feet abutting a commercial district. 
(5)  Front yard parking will not be permitted. 
(6)  Side and rear yard parking setback abutting residential district 25 feet (ten feet in abutting commercial district). 
(7)  Maximum main and accessory buildings coverage of site 25 percent. 
(8)  Minimum open space of site 25 percent. 
(9)  Minimum frontage of 150 feet. 
(10)  Buffering consistent with Codified Chapter 1165. 
(11)  Maximum height two stores, not to exceed 35 feet. 
(12)  Traffic impact analysis by a professional engineer to be provided by applicant if requested by the Planning Commission. 
(13)  In determining total square foot for new construction and/or additions, attics, crawl spaces and unfinished basements will not be included. 
(b)  Safeguards and conditions. 
(1)  Safeguards and conditions may also be set forth in the permit in addition to the general standards set forth in subsection (a) herein, which are deemed necessary for the general welfare, for the protection of individual property rights and for insuring that the intent and objectives of this Zoning Code will be observed. 
(Ord. 05-52. Passed 6-27-05.) 
1124.04 - Nonconforming use, structure, or site condition. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to recognize the existence of uses, buildings, lots and structures that lawfully existed in the First and Third Residence Districts at the time of this Zoning Code amendment, but which now do not conform to the new regulations. 
(b)  Existing use deemed conditional use. Any lawfully existing use that, at the time of its establishment, that was not classified as a Conditional Use, but which now, because of the amendment of this Zoning Code is listed as a Conditional Use, shall be deemed without further action to be a conforming conditional use. 
(c)  Nonconforming buildings, structures, and site. Conditional Uses which have nonconforming buildings, structures or site conditions which were conforming prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code and which became nonconforming due to amendment of this Zoning Code, shall be deemed lawful nonconforming buildings, structures and sites. 
(d)  Interpretation . For the purpose of interpretation and application of this section, a baseline for each structure or building shall be established at the time of enactment of this amendment. The expansion or expansions of new or existing structures permitted under this section shall be cumulative. When the sum of future expansions, reduced by the removal of footage other than attics, crawl spaces and unfinished basements, exceeds a total of 35% of the established baseline total square feet, this section shall apply. 
(e)  Maintenance and repair of structures. Ordinary repairs may be performed on a nonconforming structure or on any portion of a structure that contains a nonconforming use. 
(f)  Alteration or reconstruction of a nonconforming use. A building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use may not be altered, improved, or reconstructed and is subject to the regulations of Chapter 1125. 
(g)  Reconstruction of a structure with a nonconforming site condition. No building or structure that is nonconforming under this Chapter shall be reconstructed to the original nonconforming conditions if the reconstruction exceeds 50 percent of the building's replacement value. 
(h)  Nonconforming structure and site condition. A structure or site which becomes nonconforming due to the adoption of this amendment may add to its existing main and accessory buildings, up to 35 percent of baseline total square feet without remedying the nonconforming site conditions. If more than 35 percent of baseline total square feet are added to the existing main, and accessory buildings, nonconforming site conditions must be brought into compliance unless the Planning Commission determines that such conformance cannot be reasonably achieved due to existing site conditions. In such case, the Planning Commission shall approve a proposed project that reduces the existing nonconforming site condition(s) to the maximum extent practicable. 
(i)  Nonconforming parking facilities. A building or use existing lawfully at the time of adoption of this amendment to the Zoning Code that does not comply with the off-street parking requirements for that use may continue without a change to such parking facilities. In the event that a use is changed or substituted, then additional off-street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with Chapter 1191. 
    A building or use with nonconforming off-street parking requirements due to the adoption of this amendment may add to its existing main and accessory building up to 35 percent of baseline total square feet without remedying the nonconforming off-street parking requirement. If more than 35 percent baseline total square feet is added to the existing main and accessory buildings, nonconforming off-street parking requirements must be brought into compliance unless the Planning Commission determines that such conformance cannot be reasonably achieved due to existing site conditions. In such case, the Planning Commission shall approve a proposed project that reduces the existing nonconforming off-street parking requirement to the maximum extent practicable.

In granting a variance, after public notice, the Board may require appropriate conditions and safeguards that they deem necessary to protect, promote and improve the surrounding properties and neighborhood. Such variance shall be limited to specific cases where the following conditions also exist: 
(1)  The practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship inheres in and is peculiar to the premises sought to be built upon or used because of physical size, shape or other characteristics of such premises or adjoining premises which differentiate such premises sought to be built upon or used will create a difficulty or hardship caused by a strict application to the provisions of this Zoning Code not generally shared by other lands or structures in the same district. 
(2)  Refusal of the variance or modification appealed for will deprive the owner of the premises sought to be built upon or used of substantial property rights.

    The following standards and criteria are established to guide the Architectural Board of Review in its review of all development, except residential one, two, and three family homes, and family and group homes proposals: 
(a)  Materials shall be appropriate for the use of the building, for weathering and for their relationship to other materials, including those used on adjacent building. 
(b)  Colors and textures shall be appropriate for the size and scale of the building, for weathering and for their relationship to the site and adjacent buildings. 
(c)  Architectural details and ornaments shall be meaningful to the overall design and appropriate for the size and scale of the building and for weathering. 
(d)  Mechanical equipment shall be considered as it affects rooftop appearance, sidewall openings, sound levels, smoke and other nuisance aspects. Also, mechanical equipment shall be considered as it relates to overhead wires, gas and electric meter stations and any other visible appurtenances. 
(e)  Approaches, drives and parking areas shall be considered as they affect the appearance from the street and from the site as well. The relationship of paving to the building shall be appropriate considering factors such as safety, drainage and landscaping. 
(f)  Landscaping shall be appropriate for the size and use of the area, and for its relationship to the building, street, parking area, walks and adjacent buildings. 
(g)  Lighting shall be considered for the appropriateness of night time illumination of the grounds, drives, walks, parking areas and the building, and its effect upon surrounding areas. 
(h)  Signs shall be considered for the appropriateness of size, scale, shape, color and illumination in relation to the building site. 
(Ord. 08-60. Passed 7-1-08.) 
1128.07 - Building materials and features. 
    Incorporated regional materials and features can help the design of new or renovated buildings be compatible with its surroundings. These Design Guidelines are based on a study of materials and features used historically in Bay Village. The substitutions of compatible new materials suggested herein are offered as preferred alternatives. 
(a)  Foundations. 
(1)  Foundations are to be constructed of structurally designed masonry or poured concrete. The proper use of stone veneer, brick, or textured concrete on new foundations is encouraged. 
(2)  The use of stucco, artificial stone, or synthetic brick is discouraged. 
Asphalt damproofing and waterproofing that is exposed above grade is not acceptable. All concrete masonry units above grade shall be parged with a cementitous material. 
(b)  Exterior walls. New construction can best blend into its community surroundings by using real wood siding. Historically four-inch clapboards (or slight variations thereof) are preferred. Other acceptable wood siding applications are beaded clapboards and horizontal tongue-and-groove siding. 
    Repairing or preserving original wood siding is preferred over replacement aluminum or vinyl siding. Replacement siding, if possible, that matches the original in appearance, material and workmanship is appropriate. When siding is applied, all architectural detailing should be retained. 
(1)  Brick, split face concrete block, and stone are acceptable building materials when properly sized and colored to its surrounding environment. 
(2)  When using brick, split face concrete block and stone, it is important to preserve at least the illusion of it being a solid wall rather than a single course or brick veneered to a stud wall. 
(3)  The concept of having the street faade constructed with a masonry veneer and the other walls constructed of wood siding is generally discouraged. 
(4)  The use of exterior finish insulation systems (EIFS) is discouraged. 
(5)  Exterior lighting shall provide safety and security around the building, identify key building elements including building name, address, entry and focal points and shall be of consistent design, in character with the building. Exterior lighting shall be as low as possible and shielded to protect nearby residential areas from glare. Multiple low wattage light sources are preferred rather than high intensity overhead lighting. 
(c)  Roofs. 
(1)  Roofs are usually a defining visual feature of a building. It is strongly encouraged that buildings be designed with gables, hipped or gambrel roofs. Steeper pitches are preferable. Flat roofs are discouraged. 
(2)  The roof shall be in scale and proportion to the overall massing of the building. 
(3)  Careful considerations shall be given to the appropriate roofing material including color, detail and texture. 
(d)  Gutters and downspouts. 
(1)  It is desirable to retain built-in or concealed gutter systems, especially where they are part of prominent architectural feature. There must be a functioning gutter system, but care should be taken to ensure the system is architecturally compatible with the structure. 
(e)  Windows and doors. 
(1)  Windows and doors are important visual elements of commercial structures. The type, placement, and composition shall be compatible with the architectural style of the building. 
(2)  Preservation of original wood windows and doors in historically significant buildings is strongly encouraged or replace with a system that replicates the detail and profile. 
(f)  Exterior paint colors. 
(1)  In general, the use of color shall be used as a means of improving the overall appearance of the community. 
(2)  The color selection should be harmonious on the building and with the color schemes of neighboring buildings. 
(3)  In general, subdued hues are preferable. Bright, harsh colors should be generally avoided. 
(Ord. 08-60. Passed 7-1-08.) 
1128.08 - Non-building design features. 
(a)  Utilities and equipment . Mechanical equipment, communications, dumpsters, pad mounted transformers, and heating and ventilating equipment are often times a necessity for business today. In general, equipment shall be screened with visually appealing architectural elements or shall be placed in the interior of the building. 
(b)  Ground equipment. These elements shall be screened by fencing or landscaping. Shrubbery can often effectively conceal ground equipment from view. In some instances, constructing attractive fencing can also camouflage such features. 
(c)  Roof equipment . Heating and ventilation equipment, satellite dishes, and other mechanical equipment shall be set back from the face of the building to minimize site lines or screened from the front and side view such that they do not become intrusive features of the building (See Chapter 1339 for Dish Antennae requirements.) 
(d)  Building utilities. Duct and vent penetrations, and utility services shall be concealed when possible. 
(Ord. 08-60. Passed 7-1-08.) 
1128.09 - Signs. 
(a)  Special attention should be given to the technical requirements contained in the Codified Ordinances. Consideration should be given to minimizing visual impact while accomplishing commercial purpose as an overall design goal. 
(b)  Signage must be compatible with the characteristics and qualities surrounding the intended location.

Chapter 1179 - SIGN CONTROL 

1179.01 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this Chapter is to create the legal framework for a comprehensive, aesthetically balanced system of visual communication devices, hereinafter referred to as free standing ground signs, wall signs, roof signs, and projecting signs, and thereby to facilitate an easy and pleasant communication between people and their environment. Since using the environment for permanent advertising signs is a privilege and not a right, it is essential to the general welfare of the community that they should be strictly regulated and that such signs should be the reasonable minimums for identifying activities and locations within the City. With this in mind, it is the intention of this Chapter to authorize the use of signs which are: 
(A)  Compatible with their surroundings; 
(B)  Expressive of the type of activity to which they pertain and of the community as a whole; 
(C)  Legible and in conformity with the circumstances in which they are seen. 
(Ord. 75-43. Passed 6-16-75.) 
1179.02 - Table of basic design elements. 
    A table of basic design elements for signs is hereby attached to and made a part of this Chapter. No signs may be erected, displayed, or substantially altered or reconstructed except in conformance with the table of basic design elements. For purposes of this ordinance, a "sign" is any surface used for the public display of pictorial or literary matter, containing letters, symbols, numbers or combinations of these, which can be seen from the right-of-way of a street or highway. This section does not apply to public safety signs. 
(Ord. 75-43. Passed 6-16-75.) 
1179.03 - Application of table of basic design elements. 
    The Table of Basic Design Elements is to be in full force and effect immediately upon enactment of this Chapter. 
(Ord. 75-43. Passed 6-16-75.) 
1179.04 - Items of information allowed. 
(A)  Each activity is entitled to display a sign or signs containing no more than eight items of information on the primary street or highway to which it has access. Each activity is entitled to display a sign or signs containing no more than six items of information on the secondary street or highway to which it has access. Each activity is entitled to display a sign or signs of no more than six square feet at rear entrance for identification or instruction purposes. Signs should be commonly designed as part of the building or architectural style and not be just unrelated areas with lettering. 
(B)  An item of information means any of the following: A word; an abbreviation; a number and a symbol; a geometric shape. 
(C)  In computing items of information, the following lettering is not to be included: 
(1)  Letters less than three inches in height, if they are contained in a wall sign; 
(2)  Letters less than 19 inches in height carved into or securely attached in such a way that they are an architectural detail of a building, provided: 
(a)  They are not illuminated apart from the building, are not made of reflecting material, and do not contrast sharply in color with the building; and 
(b)  Do not exceed one inch in thickness. 
(D)  Signs may be displayed as ground signs, wall signs, roof signs, or projecting signs, within the limitations and restrictions as further provided by this Chapter, provided the items of information allowance authorized by this section is not exceeded. 
(E)  The Review Committee has the right to adjust the provisions above where it is obvious that an alternative plan meets the basic intent of this Chapter. 
(Ord. 75-43. Passed 6-16-75.) 
1179.05 - Design criteria. 
(A)  Free standing ground signs. 
(1)  Any activity or group of activities may display one free standing ground sign of the area and height indicated in the Table of Basic Design Elements, provided: 
(a)  The activity is accessible by automobile and has off-street parking on the premises; or 
(b)  The front of the building or structure in which the activity is conducted is set back at least 35 feet from edge of the adjacent street right-of-way. 
(2)  Free standing ground signs are also subject to the following additional limitations: 
(a)  A free standing ground sign which is six square feet or more in area may be displayed only on a frontage of 100 feet or more; 
(b)  Where frontage exceeds 100 feet, only one free standing ground sign shall be permitted for common multiple use. For each 100 feet of frontage no more than eight items of information shall be displayed. Eight items of information may be displayed on one or both sides of a free standing ground sign. 
(c)  An activity may have both free standing ground and projecting signs but only one of these signs may be six square feet or more in size; 
(d)  Such signs and their supports are not permitted to project over public property. 
(B)  Wall and roof signs. 
(1)  Any activity or group of activities may display wall or roof signs, or a combination of both, subject to the requirements of the Table of Basic Design Elements. Wall signs may be attached flat to or pinned away from the wall, but may not project from the wall by more than 12 inches. For purposes of this Chapter, a "roof sign" is a sign which is displayed above the eaves and under the roof line. 
(2)  The permitted area of wall and roof signs is shown by the Table of Basic Design Elements, which indicates the percentage of the signable area of the building or structure which may be utilized for wall and roof signs. "Signable area" of the building means an area of the facade of the building up to the roof line which is free of windows and doors or major architectural detail. One signable area may be chosen for each activity, and the square footage for such area shall be calculated as an imaginary rectangle or square enclosed therein. 
(3)  In calculating the signable wall area of a building which may be used for wall and roof signs the following provisions also apply: 
(a)  The total area of the sign, including the background, is counted as part of the signable area, if the sign is enclosed by a box or outline. 
(b)  Only the rectangular area of the letter is counted as part of the signable area if the sign consists of individual letters. 
(4)  Wall and roof signs are subject to the following limitations: 
(a)  Wall signs placed in the vertical space between windows may not exceed in height more than ? of the distance between the top of a window and the sill of the window above, or major architectural details related thereto; 
(b)  All or a portion of the signable area may be contained in a roof sign. For commercial activities, no roof sign may be higher than the ground sign permitted by the Table of Basic Design Elements for the same activity at the same location; 
(c)  Wall signs may not extend above the roof line; 
(d)  A sign may not cover or interrupt major architectural features. 
(5)  Where it is obvious that an alternative plan meets the basic intent of this Chapter, the Review Committee has the right to adjust the provisions above. 
(C)  Projecting signs . 
(1)  Any activity or group of activities may display one projecting sign, subject to the requirements of the Table of Basic Design Elements, on each street frontage. 
(2)  The following additional regulations also apply to projecting signs: 
(a)  Projecting signs must clear sidewalks by at least eight feet and may project no more than four feet from the building; 
(b)  Projecting signs must be pinned away from the wall at least six inches; 
(c)  Projecting signs are not permitted at the intersection of corners, except at right angles to a building front; 
(d)  Projecting signs may not extend vertically beyond the roof eave or parapet; 
(e)  No projecting signs may be closer than 25 feet to any other projecting signs. 
(Ord. 75-43. Passed 6-16-75.) 
1179.06 - Conformance requirements. 
(A)  All nonconforming signs must be removed, changed or altered to conform to the provisions of this Chapter, according to the following schedule, except when there is a modification of a sign it must be brought up to conform with this passage: 
Original Cost of Sign Compliance Period Less than $100.00 By end of 6 months 100.00 to 500.00 By end of 12 months 500.00 to 1,000.00 By end of 24 months 1,000.00 to 3,000.00 By end of 48 months More than 3,000.00 By end of 60 months  
(B)  If more than one sign permitted for an activity is or becomes nonconforming, the original cost of all the signs so displayed shall be aggregated for purposes of determining the applicable compliance period. 
(C)  A sign is or becomes "nonconforming" if it is not in conformance with the provisions of this Chapter and the Table of Basic Design Elements. 
(D)  The City, with the guidance of the Review Committee, will survey all existing applicable signs, and all owners having signs which do not conform with this Chapter will be notified in writing by the City. Those cited by the City can elect to be bound by the requirements of the compliance schedule, or may apply within 30 days to the Review Committee for individual consideration. The Review Committee may waive or modify application of compliance provisions when any sign is considered to meet both of the following requirements: 
(1)  General conformity to the spirit of the sign control ordinance; 
(2)  Present special financial or physical problems to move or replace any sign. 
(E)  A final appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals is still available to owners of signs cited under provisions of this Chapter. 
(F)  The compliance period prescribed in subsection (A) of this section shall begin to run on the date on which the notice is given to owner that sign is nonconforming. 
(G)  A change in the ownership of the real estate or a change in the management of the property or business activity does not affect the status of an existing sign under this Chapter. 
(Ord. 75-43. Passed 6-16-75.) 
1179.07 - Areas of special control. 
    It is recognized that the regulations provided in this Chapter cannot sensitively handle all of the sign situations in an area as diverse as that covered by the City of Bay Village. Therefore, the Council on recommendation by the Planning Commission, by ordinance, and following notice and hearing, may designate any of the following areas as areas of special control and locate them on a special map designed for that purpose, and authorize special provisions by ordinance: 
(A)  Architectural, historic or scenic areas whose special and unique visual characteristics, or whose natural beauty, require special sign regulations to insure that all signs used within the area are compatible with each other. Generally it is expected that sign regulations in these areas will be more restrictive than those which would otherwise be applicable under this Chapter. 
(B)  Shopping centers are, by nature, highly individual in design characteristics and therefore require special flexibility in sign design. When so designated, shopping centers will submit their sign plans to the Planning Commission along with site and general building plans when requesting a building permit. 
(Ord. 75-43. Passed 6-16-75.) 
1179.08 - Permits. 
    No signs other than temporary window signs, or those permitted "home" signs (see 1179.10(B)) may be displayed unless Application for Sign Permit is made to the Building Commissioner who refers it to the Review Committee. This Committee by their approval authorizes issuances of a permit for the display of the sign. (See C.O. 1305.02(f) Fees for Sign Permits.) The Review Committee may determine the manner in which application to display a sign is made; may require the application be accompanied by the name, address and telephone number of the owner as well as the applicant; the location of the structure to which or upon which the sign is to be painted, attached, or erected; the position of the sign in relation to other nearby structures; a site plan, drawings, or other suitable illustrations sufficient to indicate the character of the sign and of the surroundings in which it is to be displayed; the illumination source, if any; and may attach to its approval of an application for sign permit, those conditions which in its judgment, are reasonable having regard to the character of the sign and of the surroundings in which it is to be displayed. 
(Ord. 75-43. Passed 6-16-75.)

(Ord. 54-42. Passed 4-29-54. Art. VIII, 2) 
1191.07 - Driveway width; planning commission determination. 
    Driveways providing access to off-street parking spaces, other than driveways for residential lots, shall have a width of not less than ten feet and not more than 12 feet if such driveway constitutes a one-way access to the off-street parking spaces; of not less than 18 feet and not more than 20 feet if it is a two-way access driveway. In the event that the Planning Commission determines that the above stated widths are not suitable for the proposed site and use, it shall have the power to vary such widths. The Planning Commission determination to vary such widths shall be based on the number of off-street parking spaces served by the driveways, the number of driveways serving the off-street parking facility, the width of abutting streets, the amount of traffic on abutting streets, the type and location of traffic control devices controlling traffic on abutting streets, pedestrian traffic in the area, the distance of such driveways from street intersections, traffic pattern within the off-street parking facility and the safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the general area of the off-street parking facility. 
(Ord. 64-26. Passed 4-20-64.) 
1191.08 - Driveway construction. 
    All off-street parking spaces and driveways, for other than residential lots, shall have smoothly graded, stabilized and dustless surfaces with adequate drainage, with such appropriate guards or curbs as the Building Commissioner shall deem necessary to define parking spaces or limit the parking area, and with proper safeguards necessary to prevent injury to adjacent premises as a result of use of such parking spaces or driveways. 
(Ord. 54-42. Passed 4-29-54. Art. VIII, 2) 
1191.09 - Distance from side lot line. 
    Notwithstanding the accessory use provisions of this Zoning Code, no off-street parking space shall be located within five feet of the side line of any lot. 
(Ord. 54-42. Passed 4-29-54. Art. VIII, 2) 
1191.10 - Illumination, apartment and business districts. 
    In Administrative Office and Apartment House Districts and in Business Districts illumination of off-street parking spaces shall be installed, provided, however, that the design and location of such illumination shall be such that Residence Districts and streets shall be shielded from any light source, and provided further, however, that such illumination shall not be of such brightness as to constitute a safety hazard to users or occupants of such parking spaces or adjacent premises.

1191.11 - Commercial loading spaces. 
    All buildings and structures hereafter constructed for or converted to use, in whole or in part, for business, commercial or manufacturing purposes shall be provided with adequate off-street loading or unloading platforms or space located not less than 50 feet from the front street line. Any such platforms or space located beside a building, structure or street shall be so located that a motor vehicle while loading or unloading will not interfere with the pedestrian or vehicular traffic upon any street or alley. For manufacturing, storage, wholesale or rental buildings or structures one off-street loading and unloading space shall be provided for each 20,000 square feet of floor area or fraction thereof. 
(Ord. 54-42. Passed 4-29-54. Art. VIII, 2) 
1191.12 - Variances. 
    When there are existing structures located on lots in either commercial or retail districts, the uses of which are to be changed or which structures are to be increased in size or capacity, the Planning Commission may decrease the number of required off-street parking spaces and/or decrease driveway width as required in this chapter, upon finding that the decrease in the number of spaces and/or decrease in driveway width will not unreasonably interfere with vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area, and that the denial of the decrease will result in a manifest injustice to the property owner.

1306.01 - General provisions. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City Council of Bay Village, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows: 
(b)  Findings of fact. The City of Bay Village has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7)  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions; 
(8)  Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and near flood prone areas; 
(9)  Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the floodplain are maintained; 
(10)  Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values of the floodplain; 
(11)  Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally incompatible; and 
(12)  Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(d)  Methods of reducing flood loss. In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
(4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other development which may increase flood damage; and, 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(e)  Lands to which these regulations apply. These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Bay Village as identified in Section 1306.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by City of Bay Village. 
(f)  Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted: 
(1)  Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both effective December 3, 2010. 
(2)  Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard. 
(3)  Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved by the City of Bay Village as required by Section 1306.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Developments. 
    Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or studies are on file at the City Hall at 350 Dover Center Road, Bay Village, Ohio. 
(g)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations. 
(h)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over these regulations. 
(i)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the City of Bay Village, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(j)  Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. 10-118. Passed 11-22-10.) 
1306.02 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application. 
(a)  Accessory structure is a structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure. 
(b)  Appeal is a request for review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a variance. 
(c)  Base flood means flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the one percent chance annual flood or 100-year flood. 
(d)  Base (100-year) flood elevation (BFE) means the water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one to three feet). 
(e)  Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
(f)  Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
(g)  Enclosure below the lowest floor. See "Lowest Floor." 
(h)  Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative. 
(i)  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is the agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(j)  Fill means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means. 
(k)  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
(l)  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) is usually the initial map, produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas. 
(m)  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) is an official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard. 
(n)  Flood insurance risk zones means zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community. Following are the zone definitions: 
(1)  Zone A means special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are not determined. 
(2)  Zones A1-30 and Zone AE means special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined. 
(3)  Zone AO means special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are determined. 
(4)  Zone AH means special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined. 
(5)  Zone A99 means special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined. 
(6)  Zone B and Zone X (shaded) means areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood. 
(7)  Zone C and Zone X (unshaded) means areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain. 
(o)  Flood insurance study (FIS) means the official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the base flood. 
(p)  Flood protection elevation means the Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator. 
(q)  Floodway. 
(1)  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community. 
(2)  The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces. 
(r)  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed. 
(s)  Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listings on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; or 
(3)  Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office. 
(t)  Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis means an analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries. 
(u)  Letter of map change (LOMC) means a Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following categories: 
(1)  Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) means a revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard area. 
(2)  Letter of map revision (LOMR) means a revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area. 
(3)  Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) means a formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies. 
(v)  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest floor. 
(w)  Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." For the purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
(x)  Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government authority. 
(y)  National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection against flood loss. 
(z)  New construction means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Bay Village Flood Insurance Rate Map, December 1, 1977, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
(aa)  Person includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community college district, technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or any court. 
(bb)  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
(cc)  Registered professional architect means a person registered to engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01 to 4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
(dd)  Registered professional engineer means a person registered as a professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
(ee)  Registered professional surveyor means a person registered as a professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
(ff)  Special flood hazard area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard," it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse. 
(gg)  Start of construction means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building. 
(hh)  Structure means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground. 
(ii)  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
(jj)  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include: 
(1)  Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new construction"; 
(2)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(3)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
(kk)  Variance means a grant of relief from the standards of these regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein. 
(ll)  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with these regulations. 
(mm)  Zone A means areas designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with no base flood elevation determined. 
(Ord. 10-118. Passed 11-22-10.) 
1306.03 - Administration. 
(a)  Designation of the floodplain administrator. The Building Director is hereby appointed to administer and implement these regulations and is referred to herein as the Floodplain Administrator. 
(b)  Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include but are not limited to: 
(1)  Evaluate applications for permits to develop in special flood hazard areas. 
(2)  Interpret floodplain boundaries and provide flood hazard and flood protection elevation information. 
(3)  Issue permits to develop in special flood hazard areas when the provisions of these regulations have been met, or refuse to issue the same in the event of noncompliance. 
(4)  Inspect buildings and lands to determine whether any violations of these regulations have been committed. 
(5)  Make and permanently keep all records for public inspection necessary for the administration of these regulations including Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Letters of Map Amendment and Revision, records of issuance and denial of permits to develop in special flood hazard areas, determinations of whether development is in or out of special flood hazard areas for the purpose of issuing floodplain development permits, elevation certificates, variances, and records of enforcement actions taken for violations of these regulations. 
(6)  Enforce the provisions of these regulations. 
(7)  Provide information, testimony, or other evidence as needed during variance hearings. 
(8)  Coordinate map maintenance activities and FEMA follow-up. 
(9)  Conduct substantial damage determinations to determine whether existing structures, damaged from any source and in special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA, must meet the development standards of these regulations. 
(c)  Floodplain development permits. It shall be unlawful for any person to begin construction or other development activity including but not limited to filling; grading; construction; alteration, remodeling, or expanding any structure; or alteration of any watercourse wholly within, partially within or in contact with any identified special flood hazard area, as established in Section 1306.01(f), until a floodplain development permit is obtained from the Floodplain Administrator. Such floodplain development permit shall show that the proposed development activity is in conformity with the provisions of these regulations. No such permit shall be issued by the Floodplain Administrator until the requirements of these regulations have been met. 
(d)  Application required. An application for a floodplain development permit shall be required for all development activities located wholly within, partially within, or in contact with an identified special flood hazard area. Such application shall be made by the owner of the property or his/her authorized agent, herein referred to as the applicant, prior to the actual commencement of such construction on a form furnished for that purpose. Where it is unclear whether a development site is in a special flood hazard area, the Floodplain Administrator may require an application for a floodplain development permit to determine the development's location. Such applications shall include, but not be limited to: 
(1)  Site plans drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and topography of the area in question; the location of existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing.

Such preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA. 
(4)  The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 1306.05, Appeals and Variances. 
(5)  Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water marks, etc.) shall prevail. 
(l)  Substantial damage determinations. 
(1)  Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall: 
A.  Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood hazard areas; 
B.  Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures located in special flood hazard areas; and 
C.  Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction. 
(2)  Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

(2)  Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted. 
(d)  Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship. 
(1)  Application for a variance. 
A.  Any owner or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to the Appeals Board. 
B.  Such application at a minimum shall contain the following information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use; description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the variance sought; and reason for the variance request. 
C.  To obtain a floodplain variance, the applicant shall file the completed application with the Floodplain Administrator with a fee of $75.00 before issuance of a permit will be considered. 
(2)  Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of these regulations and the following factors: 
A.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others. 
B.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 
C.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. 
D.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
E.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage. 
F.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable. 
G.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development. 
H.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area. 
I.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
J.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site. 
K.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
A.  A showing of good and sufficient cause. 
B.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant. 
C.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws. 
D.  A determination that the structure or other development is protected by methods to minimize flood damages. 
E.  A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations. 
(4)  Other conditions for variances. 
A.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
B.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items in Section 1306.04(d)(2)A.-K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
C.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(e)  Procedure at hearings. 
(1)  All testimony shall be given under oath. 
(2)  A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses. 
(3)  The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony in support of the appeal or variance. 
(4)  The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition to the appeal or variance. 
(5)  All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse party or their counsel. 
(6)  Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become part of the record for appeal. 
(7)  The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and service shall be collected in advance. 
(8)  The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable time after the hearing. 
(f)  Appeal to the court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

(b)  Protect and maintain the receiving stream's physical, chemical, biological characteristics and stream functions. 
(c)  Provide perpetual management of storm water runoff quality and quantity. 
(d)  Establish consistent technically feasible and operationally practical standards to achieve a level of storm water quantity and quality control that will minimize damage to public and private property and degradation of water resources, and will promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the Community. 
(e)  Control storm water runoff resulting from soil disturbing activities. 
(f)  Preserve, to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), the natural drainage characteristics of the building site. 
(g)  Preserve, to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), natural infiltration and groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, wetlands, and wells. 
(h)  Assure that storm water quality controls are incorporated into site planning and design at the earliest possible stage. 
(i)  Reduce the need for costly treatment and mitigation for the damage to and loss of water resources that are the result of inadequate storm water quality control. 
(j)  Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to address problems caused by inadequate storm water quality control. 
(k)  Require the incorporation of water quality protection that encourages and promotes habitat preservation into the construction of storm water management practices. 
(l)  Ensure that all storm water quality practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained. 
(Ord. 11-08. Passed 3-21-11.) 
1308.03 - Disclaimer of liability.

This section shall not apply to a residence that is vacant and which is not subject to condemnation orders by the Building Director. This section shall also not prohibit ordinary repairs to a residence or residential accessory building that are not in conflict with other provisions in this regulation. 
D.  A nonconforming structure or use that is discontinued may be resumed any time within six months from such discontinuance but not thereafter. No change or resumption shall be permitted that is more detrimental to riparian and wetland setbacks, as measured against the intent and objectives of these regulations as determined by the Community, than the existing or former nonconforming structure or use. 
E.  In the case of a nonconforming structure within a riparian or wetland setback, the Community will allow a ten-foot maintenance access zone measured perpendicular to the structure, to temporarily extend further into the setback as long as disturbance to existing vegetation is minimized and vegetation is restored to the pre-existing state, as near as practical, upon completion. If any soil disturbance in a wetland will occur as part of any such maintenance activity, a permit from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers or the Ohio EPA, as appropriate, must be submitted prior to the onset of the soil disturbing activity. 
F.  In the case of a nonconforming residential structure, the Service Director, or their representative may allow minor upgrades to the structure that extend further into the riparian setback, such as awnings and pervious decks/patios, provided the modifications do not extend more than ten feet further toward the watercourse than the original foundation of the structure existing at the time of passage of this regulation, and further provided that the modification will not impair the function of the riparian zone nor destabilize any slope nor stream bank, as determined by the Service Director, or their representative. 
(8)  Variances within riparian setbacks. 
A.  The BZA may grant a variance to this regulation as provided herein. In granting a variance, the following conditions shall apply: 
1.  In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship with respect to the use of a property or practical difficulty with respect to maintaining the riparian setback as established in this regulation, such as to justify the granting of a variance, the BZA shall consider the potential harm or reduction in riparian functions that may be caused by a proposed structure or use. 
2.  The BZA may not authorize any structure or use in a Zoning District other than those authorized in the Zoning Code. 
3.  Variances shall be void if not implemented within one year of the date of issuance. 
B.  In making a determination under Section 1308.08(k)(7) of this regulation, the BZA may consider the following: 
1.  The natural vegetation of the property as well as the percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain. 
2.  The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood control, erosion control, water quality protection, or other functions of the riparian setback. This determination shall be made by the Service Director, or their representative upon reviewing any necessary scientific data and calculations to be provided by the applicant. 
3.  The degree of hardship, with respect to the use of a property or the degree of practical difficulty with respect to maintaining the riparian setback as established in this regulation, placed on the landowner by this regulation and the availability of alternatives to the proposed structure or use. 
4.  Soil-disturbing activities permitted in the riparian setback through variances should be implemented to minimize clearing to the extent possible and to include Best Management Practices necessary to minimize erosion and control sediment. 
5.  The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation such as maintained lawns, in the riparian setback compromises its benefits to the Community. Variances should not be granted for asphalt or concrete paving in the riparian setback. Variances may be granted for gravel driveways when necessary. 
6.  Whether a property, otherwise buildable under the ordinances of the Community, will be made unbuildable because of this regulation. 
C.  In order to maintain the riparian setback to the maximum extent practicable, the BZA may consider granting variations to other area or setback requirements imposed on a property by the Zoning Code. 
D.  In granting a variance under this regulation, the BZA, for good cause, may impose such conditions that it deems appropriate to maintain the purposes of this regulation. These conditions include but are not limited to the following mitigation measures: 
1.  Prohibiting the discharge of a storm drain directly into a watercourse; 
2.  Establishing an end-of-pipe stormwater management practice (e.g., rain garden); 
3.  Re-establishing native trees, shrubs and other vegetation within available riparian setback areas;

H.  For sites less than five acres, but greater than one acre and not part of a common plan of development, where five or more acres are disturbed, the City may approve other BMPs if the applicant demonstrates to the City's satisfaction that these BMPs meet the objectives of this regulation. 
(2)  Development sites five acres or larger. A development site that disturbs five or more acres of land or will disturb less than five acres, but is a part of a larger common plan of development or sale, which will disturb five or more acres of land shall identify: 
A.  Storm Water Detention: The Post-Construction BMP(s) chosen must be able to detain storm water runoff for protection of the stream channels, stream erosion control, and improved water quality. 
B.  Structural BMPs: Structural (designed) Post-Construction storm water treatment practices shall be incorporated into the permanent drainage system for the site. 
C.  Properly Sized BMPs: The BMP(s) chosen must be sized to treat the water quality volume (WQv) and ensure compliance with Ohio's Water Quality Standards in OAC Chapter 3745-1. The WQv shall be equivalent to the volume of runoff from a 0.75-inch rainfall and shall be determined according to one of the two following methods: 
1.  Through a site hydrologic study approved by the local municipal permitting authority that uses continuous hydrologic simulation and local long-term hourly precipitation records; or 
2.  Using the following equation: 
a.  WQv = C * P * A / 12 where: 
WQv = water quality volume in acre-feet 
C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than one inch (either using Table 1 or the following formula: 
C=0.858i-0.78i2 + 0.774i + 0.04 
where i=fraction of post-construction impervious area) 
P = 0.75 inch precipitation depth 
A = area draining into the BMP in acres 
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use 
Land Use Runoff Coefficient Industrial & Commercial 0.8 High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre) 0.5 Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4 Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre) 0.3 Open Space and Recreational Areas 0.2  
D.  Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated using a weighted average. For example, if 60 percent of the contributing drainage area to the storm water treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30 percent is High Density Residential, and ten percent is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3) + (0.3)(0.5) + (0.1)(0.2) = 0.35. 
E.  An additional volume equal to 20 percent of the WQv shall be incorporated into the BMP for sediment storage and/or reduced infiltration capability. The BMPs will be designed according to the methodology included in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, ODOT Post-Construction storm water standards, or other manual that is acceptable to Ohio EPA. 
F.  The BMPs listed in Table 2 below shall be considered standard BMPs approved for general use. However, communities with a regulated MS4 may limit the use of some of these BMPs. BMPs shall be designed such that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment, but short enough to provide storage available for successive rainfall events and avoid the creation of nuisance conditions. The outlet structure for the post-construction BMP must not discharge more than the first half of the WQv in less than one-third of the drain time.

* Dry basins must include forebay and micropool each sized at ten percent of the WQv. 
** Provide both a permanent pool and an EDv above the permanent pool, each sized at 0.75 WQv. 
+ Extended detention shall be provided for the full WQv above the permanent water pool. 
^ The WQv shall completely infiltrate within 48 hours so there is no standing or residual water in the BMP. 
#Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25 percent of the WQv in a pool and 75 percent in marshes. The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal to the WQv. 
G.  The owner may request approval from the Service Director, or their representative to use alternative structural Post-Construction BMPs if the owner can demonstrate, that the alternative BMPs are equivalent in effectiveness to those listed in Table 2 above, and has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA. The use of alternative or vender supplied Post-Construction BMPs should be limited to redevelopment projects where justification is provided that the traditional BMPs in Table 2 are technically and economically infeasible. To demonstrate the equivalency, the applicant must show: 
1.  The alternative BMP has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS) removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol. 
2.  The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected BMP is reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge rate from the BMP will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate one of the following conditions: 
a.  The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater. 
b.  The development will create less than one acre of impervious surface. 
c.  The development project is a redevelopment project with an ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of the project area is already impervious surface and the storm water discharge is directed into an existing storm sewer system. 
d.  The storm water drainage system of the development discharges directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where the development area is less than five percent of the water area upstream of the development site, unless a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) has identified water quality problems in the receiving surface water of the State. 
H.  Construction activities shall be exempt from this condition if it can be demonstrated that the WQv is provided within an existing structural Post-Construction BMP that is part of a larger common plan of development or sale or if structural Post-Construction BMPs are addressed in a regional or local storm water management plan. 
A municipally operated regional storm water BMP can be used as a post-construction BMP provided that the BMP can detain the WQv from the entire drainage area and release it over a 24-hour period upon written permission from the Service Director, or their representative. 
I.  For redevelopment projects (i.e., developments on previously developed property), Post-Construction practices shall either ensure a 20 percent net reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv, or a combination of the two. Where projects are a combination of new development and redevelopment, the total WQv that must be treated shall be calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at 100 percent WQv and redevelopment at 20 percent WQv.

    Any portion of the permanent drainage and soil erosion systems, including on-site and off-site storage facilities that are constructed by the owner, will be continuously maintained into perpetuity. 
(a)  Maintenance plans shall be provided by the permittee to both the Service Director, or their representative and the post-construction operator of the BMP (including homeowner associations) upon completion of construction activities and prior to the Service Director, or their representative giving final approval for the completed construction. 
(b)  Single-family and multi-family residential developments. A Homeowners' Association shall be created and placed in title of the affected lands and shall be continuously responsible for post-construction maintenance and inspections into perpetuity unless such maintenance and inspections become officially accepted by the Community. 
(c)  Apartments, commercial and industrial developments. The plans will clearly state that the owner of the property shall be continuously responsible for post-construction maintenance and inspections into perpetuity unless the Community officially accepts such maintenance and inspections. 
(d)  Maintenance design. All temporary and permanent soil erosion and sediment control practices shall be designed and constructed to minimize maintenance requirements. Multi-use facilities incorporating assets such as aesthetics and recreation may be incorporated into the design of the drainage facilities. All permanent drainage, soil erosion, sediment control, water quality management systems and BMPs, including on-site and off-site structures and vegetation that are constructed or planted, must be inspected and maintained into perpetuity by the responsible party designated in the plans. Inspections and maintenance will be incorporated periodically throughout the year to ensure that the facilities are properly operational. 
(e)  Perpetual maintenance inspections. One inspection with a written report will be performed each year. The written report will be given to the Service Director, or their representative by May 1 of each and every year after the Best Management Practice (BMP) has been completed. 
(1)  Structures that require a permit from the Ohio Division of Water. A written and stamped report from a professional engineer on the status of all structural BMPs that require a permit from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Division of Water. This applies to all BMPs that require a permit either at the time of construction or fall under the jurisdiction of the ODNR Division of Water at any time after construction is completed. 
(2)  Easements. A written report from an inspector on the status of all storm water management easements for each project shall be submitted to the Service Director, or their representative by May 1 of each year into perpetuity. These reports will document if restricted plantings, fences and structures are on the easement and will identify the location of the noted easement restriction violations. 
(3)  Best management practices (BMPs) that do not have a high risk for loss of life, bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure related to imminent failure as determined by the service director, or their representative. A written and stamped report from a professional engineer, landscape architect or Certified Professional In Erosion and Sediment Control (CPESC) on the status of permanent soil erosion, sediment control, water quality management systems and the status of the related easements shall be submitted to the Service Director, or their representative by May 1 of each year into perpetuity. 
(4)  BMPs that have a potential loss of life. A written and stamped report covering the status of all BMPs that have a potential for loss of life, bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure will be prepared by a professional engineer or other individual possessing a valid state license that authorizes them to design the same type of BMP for construction. 
(Ord. 11-09. Passed 3-21-11.) 
1309.12 - Minimum standards. 
    In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or person responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following standards. 
(a)  Plan. The plan shall include measures that control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent soil erosion from occurring. 
(b)  Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap sediment from areas remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. 
(c)  Sediment barriers. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be intercepted by Silt Fence or Diversions to protect adjacent properties and water resources from sediment. Where intended to provide sediment control, Silt Fence shall be placed on a level contour. The relationship between the maximum drainage areas to Silt Fence for a particular slope is shown in the table below (placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the size of the drainage area). 
Table 1: Silt Fence Applicability 
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 linear feet of Silt Fence Range of slope for a particular drainage area (in percent) 0.5 < 2% 0.25 > 2% but < 20% 0.125 > 20% but < 50%  
    This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers designed to control sheet flow runoff. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier shall not exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier. Straw Bale Barriers are not acceptable. 
(d)  Storm water diversion practices. Storm water diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where practicable. Such practices, which include Swales, Dikes or Berms, Pipe Slope Drains and Diversions, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten acres. Storm water diversion practices alone are not considered a sediment control practice unless those are used in conjunction with a sediment settling pond. 
(e)  All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered functional. 
(f)  Clearing and grubbing will be done in two or more phases. The first phase will include only those locations necessary to install the perimeter soil erosion, sediment and storm water control BMPs. After the perimeter controls are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of clearing and grubbing may continue. 
(g)  Timing of sediment trapping practices. Sediment control practices shall be functional throughout all phases of up slope earth disturbing activity. Settling facilities, perimeter controls and other practices intended to trap sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope development area is permanently restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns. 
(h)  Stabilization of denuded areas. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in the tables below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES Storm Water Permit Rules, whichever is most restrictive: 
Table 2: Permanent Stabilization 
Area requiring permanent stabilization Time frame to apply erosion controls Any areas that will lie dormant for one year or more Within seven days of the most recent disturbance Any areas within 50 feet of a stream and at final grade Within two days of reaching final grade Any other areas at final grade Within seven days of reaching final grade within that area  
Table 3: Temporary Stabilization 
Area requiring temporary stabilization Time frame to apply erosion controls Any disturbed areas within 50 feet of a stream and not at final grade Within two days of the most recent disturbance if the area will remain idle for 21 days or more Disturbed areas that will be dormant for more than 21 days but less than one year and not within 50 feet of a stream Within seven days of the most recent disturbance within the area. Residential subdivisions for disturbance which has occurred on building lots Within seven days of the most recent disturbance if housing unit construction on the lot is not scheduled to begin within 21 days of the disturbance. 
In any case, Temporary or Permanent Stabilization will be properly installed, pursuant to the most recent edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual, before the second building permit is issued. Non-residential subdivisions and commercial developments Within seven days of the most recent disturbance if further construction activity will not occur within 21 days of the disturbance. 
Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural instability or are otherwise prohibited, alternative stabilization techniques must be employed. Disturbed areas that will be idle over winter Prior to the onset of winter weather  
    Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques must be employed. 
(i)  Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond is required for any one of the following conditions: 
 Concentrated storm water runoff (e.g., storm sewer or ditch); 
 Runoff from drainage areas, which exceed the design capacity of silt fence or other sediment barriers; 
 Runoff from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of inlet protection; or 
 Runoff from common drainage locations with ten or more acres of disturbed land. 
 Alternative controls can be used if the owner can show, in writing, that the Ohio EPA approved the use of alternatives that the owner demonstrated to be equivalent in effectiveness to a sediment settling pond. 
(1)  Where storm sewer drainage areas include ten or more acres disturbed at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond must be provided until final stabilization of the site. In single-family residential construction, final stabilization is after the houses are built and permanent landscaping is done. 
A.  It is recommended that for drainage locations of less than ten acres, smaller sediment settling basins and/or sediment traps be used. 
(2)  Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than 1,800 cubic feet of dewatering zone area per acre of total contributing drainage area and 1,000 cubic feet per disturbed acre of sediment storage zone area. The storage volume will be measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the primary (principle) spillway. 
(3)  Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to trap sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of sediment-laden water. The draw down time must be at least 48 hours, or meet the criteria in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual whichever is most stringent. 
(4)  The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet of settling ponds must provide at least two units of length for each one unit of width (> 2:1 length to width ratio); a length to width ratio of 4:1 is recommended. 
(5)  The depth of the dewatering zone of the sediment settling pond must be less than or equal to five feet. 
(6)  Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling ponds when the design capacity has been reduced by 40 percent. 
(7)  Public safety, especially as it relates to children, must be considered in the design. Alternative sediment controls must be used where site limitations would preclude a safe design. 
(8)  Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be constructed in any stream channel. 
(j)  Storm sewer inlet protection. 
(1)  All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter the storm sewer, unless the storm drain system drains to a Sediment Settling Pond and is exempted in writing by the Service Director, or their representative. In areas where construction will be ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer protection shall be maintained until all up slope areas reach final stabilization, as determined by the City Engineer. 
(2)  All inlets receiving runoff from drainage areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond. 
(3)  At the end of this period the site owner shall hydraulically clean the storm sewers to the satisfaction of the Service Director, or their representative. All sediments shall be removed from the system and shall not be flushed downstream. 
(k)  Storm sewer and other drainage outlets. All storm sewers, footer drains, roof gutter drains and all other drains will be outletted at the bottom of the slope. The slope below the outlet will be able to control the water being drained through the storm sewer or other drains without causing erosion of the stream or channel banks or channel bottom or other areas that the water is outletted on. 
(l)  Working near, or crossing streams and wetlands. 
(1)  Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources, wetlands, riparian areas, and their setbacks. If construction vehicles must cross these areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall be constructed. Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed and banks, shall be restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or stopped. Erodible materials will not be used in making stream crossings. 
(2)  No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may slough, slip, or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is authorized by the approving authority and, when applicable, the US Army Corps of Engineers and Ohio EPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges, culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures. 
(3)  If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to streams, structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to protect the adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff. 
A.  No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be constructed in a stream channel. 
B.  Streams and wetland setbacks required by the community will be implemented. As a minimum a setback of 25 feet, as measured from the ordinary high water mark of the surface water, will be maintained in its natural state as a permanent buffer. 
(m)  Construction entrance. 
(1)  Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto public roads, or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls. 
(2)  Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be implemented as required by the Service Director, or their representative and the Ohio EPA. These will be planned and installed according to the requirements in the most recent edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual. 
(3)  Where soil is transported onto a public road surface, the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently, in order to ensure public safety. Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by shoveling or sweeping. Street washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer inlet protection is properly installed unless end of sewer sediment ponds exist and are properly functioning. 
(4)  Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to enable equipment to cross curbs. Non-erosive materials (e.g. wood and stone) can be used. 
(n)  Unstable soils. 
(1)  Unstable soils will be as determined by the local county Soil Survey or by a detailed soils report. 
(2)  The Service Director, or their representative may require detailed soil reports when deemed necessary. 
(3)  Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not be graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems. 
(o)  Cut and fill slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization. The minimum final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical ratio of 2:1 (the horizontal will be two times the vertical). 
(p)  Stabilization of outfalls and channels. Outfalls and constructed or modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from the planned post-development frequency storm without eroding. The planned post-construction velocity and flow shall include the entire contributing watershed. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected. 
(q)  Establishment of permanent vegetation. A permanent vegetative cover shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized. Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is achieved which, in the opinion of the Service Director, or their representative, has 80 percent vegetative density over the entire disturbed area and provides adequate cover, and is mature enough to satisfactorily control soil erosion and survive adverse weather conditions. 
(r)  Disposition of temporary practices. All temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer needed, unless otherwise required by the Service Director, or their representative. Trapped sediment shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion. The Construction Maintenance Guarantee shall not be released by the Community until all temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices that are no longer needed have been removed, properly disposed of and any trapped sediment has been stabilized. 
(s)  Underground utility construction. The construction of underground utility lines, pipes, etc. shall be subject to the following criteria: 
(1)  Trenches shall remain open for no more than five days. 
(2)  There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters resulting from dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a sediment settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site or to waters of the state. 
(3)  When discharging clean ground water care must be taken to ensure that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed soils or other pollutant sources. 
(t)  Inspections. 
(1)  If inspections or other information indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be replaced or modified for the site conditions. 
(2)  The owner of the development area shall have the site inspected for soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns every seven calendar days, and within 24 hours of a 0.5 inch or greater rainfall event until the Service Director, or their representative certifies the site as being stable. The Service Director, or their representative certification does not relieve the permittee from meeting the Ohio EPA NPDES inspection requirements. 
(3)  The inspection frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g., the site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen.) A waiver of inspection requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions are expected to result in a discharge if all of the following conditions are met: the project is located in an area where frozen conditions are anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e., more than one month); land disturbance activities have been suspended; and the beginning and ending dates of the waiver period are documented. Once a definable area has been fully permanently stabilized, you may mark this on your plans and no further inspection requirements apply to that portion of the site. 
(4)  Following each inspection, a checklist must be completed and signed by the qualified inspection personnel representative. At a minimum, the inspection report must include: 
 The inspection date; 
 Names, titles, and qualifications of personnel making the inspection; 
 Weather information for the period since the last inspection including the timing, duration, and depth of any storms; 
 Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring at the time of the inspection; 
 Location(s) of discharges of sediment or other pollutants from the site; 
 Location(s) of BMPs that need to be maintained; 
 Location(s) of BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate for a particular location; 
 Location(s) where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the time of the inspection; and 
 Corrective action required including any necessary changes to the Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan and implementation dates. 
(5)  The inspection log will include the date and actions taken to correct problems noted in past inspection logs. 
(6)  If the construction site is subject to Ohio EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for construction activity, a copy of all of the required inspection sheets will be submitted to the Service Director, or their representative within three working days of the date that the inspection was conducted. 
(7)  Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system. 
(8)  Erosion and sediment controls identified in the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. 
(9)  Discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts to the receiving waters. 
(10)  Sensitive areas including riparian and wetland setbacks shall be observed to ensure that they remain well marked and undisturbed. 
(11)  Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking. 
(12)  If the inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of sediment settling ponds, it must be repaired or maintained within three days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten days of the inspection. 
(13)  If any inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its intended function and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the Construction Site Conservation Plan must be amended and the new control practice must be installed within ten days of the inspection. 
(14)  If the inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in the time required by this chapter it must be installed within ten days from the date of inspection. 
(15)  If the inspection reveals that a planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed. 
(u)  Control of materials and debris. Site management practices shall be implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris from entering the Community's and state's water resources or wetlands. These practices shall include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  A covered dumpster shall be made available for the proper disposal of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum and etc. A second covered dumpster will be provided for the proper disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes. 
(2)  The washing of excess concrete material into a street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource shall not occur. A designated area for concrete washouts shall be made available and used for all concrete washouts. 
(3)  All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110 percent of the volume of the largest container in the storage area. All additional requirements of the local fire authority must be followed. If the fuel tanks have a self-contained "dike," the plug will be kept in the "dike" tank at all times. 
(4)  Any toxic or hazardous wastes and/or contaminated soils must be disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and statutes. Local health districts and Ohio EPA can provide guidance on these issues. 
(5)  On a site with a prior industrial land use or a site that is contaminated with gasoline, fuel oil, hydrocarbon based chemicals or other Ohio EPA regulated contaminates, the storm water is considered wastewater. A permit from Ohio EPA is required to address these sites. 
(6)  Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid waste landfill sites. 
(7)  Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints and other paint wastes are considered solid wastes and shall be disposed of in accordance with applicable state regulations. Appropriate handling of these wastes shall occur at the site so as to prevent the discharge of these wastes into surface or ground waters. 
A.  Water based paint washing liquids and small quantities of excess water based paints may be disposed of by flushing down a connected sanitary sewer but may not be disposed of in an on-lot disposal system. 
B.  All other paints, paint thinners, and paint cleaning materials will be disposed of in the site's hazardous waste disposal dumpster. 
(8)  Restroom facilities will be provided for site workers at all times that workers are present on the site and during all phases of the construction 
(9)  All required permits from appropriate federal, state, or local agencies are required to develop land with a previous industrial or commercial use or another use that may have led to soil contamination by a regulated pollutant. 
(v)  Pre-winter stabilization. If the development area will, or is planned to remain, active through the winter months, the owner of the development area shall hold a Pre-Winter Stabilization Meeting. The meeting will be held before October 1. The owner shall invite the operator, developer, engineer, contractor, Service Director, or their representative and anyone else requested by the Service Director, or their representative to the meeting. 
(w)  Storm water basins. 
(1)  Pool geometry. The minimum length-to-width ratio for the pond is 3:1 (the length will be three times the width). 
(2)  Riser in embankment. The riser shall be located within the embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by manholes. 
(3)  Water drains. Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that can completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the pond to prevent sediment deposition from plugging the drain. 
(4)  Adjustable gate valves. Both the storm water management and water quality basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall be located inside the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be operated in a safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the valves shall be fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying official shall attest to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism, the handwheel shall be chained to a ringbolt or manhole step. 
(5)  Principal spillway. Each principal spillway shall be designed in accordance with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the county. Each principal spillway shall have the capacity to pass the 100-year design storm flow. The inlet or riser size for the pipe drops shall be designed so that the flow through the structure goes from weir flow control to pipe flow control without going into orifice control in the riser. The crest elevation of the primary spillway shall be no less than one foot below the emergency spillway crest. Premium joint pipe is required and a removable trash rack shall be installed at each location. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all pipe conduits through an embankment. 
(6)  Emergency spillway. An emergency spillway shall be provided on each storm water management basin. Emergency spillways shall convey flood flows safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in accordance with NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the local county. Emergency spillways shall have a 100-year design storm capacity unless exempted in writing by the Service Director, or their representative. 
(7)  Embankments. Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the county that the project is located in. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all pipe conduits through an embankment. 
(8)  Safety features. 
A.  The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to the public and other non-maintenance personnel. 
B.  The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than three feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following: 
1.  A safety bench, with a maximum slope of three percent, which extends outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum of 25 feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and maintenance vehicles that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may be landscaped, without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water pool. 
2.  Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench shall not be steeper than 3:1 (three feet horizontal for every one foot vertical). 
3.  An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15 inches below the normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to prevent access to the deeper water pool. 
4.  Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (two feet horizontal for every one foot vertical). 
5.  The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to eliminate drop-offs and other hazards. 
6.  Side slopes getting to the pond shall not exceed 3:1 and shall terminate on a safety bench. 
7.  Soil erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the current edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, NRCS Field Office Technical Guide for the local county or the Ohio EPA, which ever is most stringent. 
(x)  These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the right of the Service Director, or their representative to impose at any time additional, more stringent requirements, nor shall the standards limit the right of the Service Director, or their representative to waive, in writing, individual requirements. 
(y)  Soil limitations shall be determined by using the current edition of the county soil survey written by the NRCS, USDA. 
(z)  Methods for controlling increases in storm water runoff peaks and volumes may include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction; for example, grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical, discharging roof water to vegetated areas, or grass and rock-lined drainage channels. 
(2)  Grading and use of grade control structures to provide a level of control in flow paths and stream gradients. 
(3)  Induced infiltration of increased storm water runoff into soil, where practical; for example, constructing special infiltration areas where soils are suitable, retaining topsoil for all areas to be vegetated, or providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities. 
(4)  Provisions for detention and retention, for example, permanent retention ponds and lakes, dry detention basins, and subsurface detention tanks. 
(Ord. 11-09. Passed 3-21-11.) 
1309.13 - Stream channel and floodplain erosion design criteria. 
(a)  Runoff rate. The peak runoff rate from the development area shall not be greater after development than it was before development. The applicant shall provide calculations proving no increase in the runoff rates from the one, two, five, ten, 25, 50, and 100-year storms. 
(b)  Runoff volume. Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset by further restricting runoff rates. Based on the increase in runoff volume, the applicant shall determine the critical storm for the development area. The runoff rate from the critical storm shall be restricted to the one year pre-development storm runoff rate. The critical storm shall be calculated as follows: 
(1)  Determine the total volume of runoff from a one-year frequency, 24-hour storm, occurring on the development area before and after development. 
(2)  From the volumes in paragraph (1) determine the percent of increase in volume of runoff due to development according to the equation (Q after divided by the Q before) X 100 and, using this percentage, select the critical storm from this table: 
Table 4: Critical Storm Selection 
The Percentage Increase In Volume Of Runoff Is: Equal To Or Greater Than And Less Than The 24-Hour "Critical Storm" For Discharge Will Be 0 10 1 Year 10 20 2 Years 20 50 5 Years 50 100 10 Years 100 250 25 Years 250 500 50 Years 500 -- 100 Years  
(c)  Detention or retention basin exemption for redevelopment or for expansion of existing facilities. 
(1)  For any development regulated by this chapter, the construction of a detention or retention basin may not be required for the development if the post-development peak discharge for a 100-year frequency 24-hour storm increases the existing peak discharge by one cubic foot per second or less using the TR-55 method of calculation or other method approved by the Service Director, or their representative. The Service Director, or their representative can waive this requirement if existing storm sewers and drainage structures can safely handle the expected increase in flow. 
(2)  Only one exemption will be allowed per parcel. Any subsequent expansion must provide for detention or retention and must include the previously exempted area. 
(d)  Where the Service Director, or their representative determines that site constraints exist in a manner that compromises the intent of this chapter to improve the management of storm water runoff as established in this section, practical alternatives may be used to result in an improvement of water quality and/or a reduction of storm water runoff. Such alternatives must be in keeping with the intent and likely cost of those measures that would otherwise be required to meet the objectives of this section. When possible, all practical alternatives shall be implemented within the drainage area of the proposed development project. Practical alternatives can include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Fees shall be paid in an amount specified by the Service Director, or their representative. These fees shall be applied by the Community to storm water management practices that reduce existing storm water runoff. 
(2)  Implementation of off-site storm water management practices. 
(3)  Watershed or stream restoration. 
(4)  Retrofitting of an existing storm water management practice. 
(5)  Other practices approved by the Service Director, or their representative in keeping with the intent of this section.

1309.14 - Compliance with other rules and regulations. 
(a)  Ohio Dam Safety Laws. The provisions of the Ohio Dam Safety Laws shall be followed. Proof of compliance with the Ohio Dam Safety Law administered by the ODNR Division of Water shall be, but is not limited to, a copy of the ODNR Division of Water permit number or a copy of the project approval letter from the ODNR Division of Water or a letter from the site owner explaining why the Ohio Dam Safety Law is not applicable. The written proof will be provided to the Service Director, or their representative before a construction permit will be issued. 
(b)  NPDES permits. The provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permits, issued by the Ohio EPA, shall be followed. Proof of compliance shall be, but is not limited to, a copy of the Ohio EPA NPDES Permit number or a letter from the site owner explaining why the NPDES Permit is not applicable. The written proof will be provided to the Service Director, or their representative before a construction permit will be issued. 
(c)  Federal and state wetland permits. The provisions of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dredge and fill permits for federally-protected wetlands shall be followed. The provisions of Ohio EPA's Isolated Wetlands Permits shall also be followed. Wetlands and other waters of the United States shall be delineated by protocols accepted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Ohio EPA at the time of the application of these regulations. Written proof of compliance with both permit programs will be provided to the Service Director, or their representative before a construction permit will be issued. Proof of compliance shall be, but is not limited to, the following: 
(1)  A copy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Individual Permit, if required for the project, showing project approval and any restrictions that apply to site activities; 
(2)  A site plan showing that any proposed fill of waters of the United States conforms to the general and specific conditions specified in the applicable Nationwide Permit; or 
(3)  A letter from the site owner verifying that a qualified professional has surveyed the site and found no wetlands or other waters of the United States. Such a letter shall be noted on site plans submitted to the Community.

1367.04 - Standards of review. 
    In its review of applications, the Planning Commission shall: 
(a)  Consider the historical and architectural nature of existing buildings, signs and structures within the Designated Historical Area and the compatibility of proposed changes or proposed new buildings, signs and structures with such existing buildings, signs and structures; 
(b)  Consider the design standards for era when constructed; 
(c)  Follow the guidelines set forth below: 
(1)  Preservation of features. The distinguishing original qualities or character of a Historically Significant Property shall not be destroyed. Removal or alteration of historic material or distinctive architectural features shall be avoided. 
(2)  Replacement of features. Deteriorated or damaged architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced. In the event that the Planning Commission determines that replacement of architectural features on a Historically Significant Property is necessary, the new material should closely match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. 
(3)  Compatibility. Alterations, additions and new development shall be compatible in scale, material and character with the design of the subject property and any Historically Significant Property in Proximity to the subject property. New structures may be constructed in accordance with a different architectural style than Historically Significant Properties. 
(4)  Contemporary design. All structures shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations, additions and new development which have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall not be required. Conversely, compatible contemporary design shall not be prohibited or discouraged except where such design would clearly detract from the architectural unity of an ensemble or group of Historically Significant Properties. 
(5)  Cleaning. The surface cleaning of Historically Significant Property shall be undertaken by the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be permitted. 
(6)  Accessory structures. Fences, walkways, street lights, benches and other accessory structures located in proximity to Historically Significant Properties shall be compatible in design with the character of such properties. 
(7)  Signs. In addition to meeting the requirements of Chapter 1179, signs located on or in proximity to Historically Significant Properties shall be compatible in color, material, placement and character with the architectural style of such Properties. 
(d)  Apply the following burdens of proof when evaluating applications under this Chapter: 
(1)  Any person asserting that a structure is an Historically Significant Property bears the burden of proving the assertion by a preponderance of the evidence; provided, that any structure built prior to 1900 and meeting the criteria of Section 1367.05(a) shall be presumed to be an Historically Significant Property, and any party asserting that such structure is not an Historically Significant Property shall bear the burden of proving the same by a preponderance of the evidence. 
(2)  If new construction is proposed, the design of the new construction shall be permitted unless it is proven that, by a preponderance of the evidence, the new building is not compatible with a Historically Significant Property that is in proximity to the proposed new building. Nothing herein shall limit the authority of the Planning Commission to require a property owner to adhere to proper architectural principles in the design, use of materials, finished grade lines and orientation of the construction of the new building or to make recommendations to the applicant regarding the proposed design. 
(3)  If an addition to, or exterior alteration of, an existing Historically Significant Property is proposed, the applicant shall bear the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the proposed addition or alteration is consistent with the historically significant features of the structure such that the historically significant features shall be preserved.

(b)  That the fire lane is incident to a retail, commercial or manufacturing use or other use where it can reasonably be expected that the public will assemble in sufficient numbers so that the presence of the public and their motor vehicles, if not controlled, will interfere with the operation of fire-fighting equipment and personnel and the egress of occupants in the case of fire. 
(Ord. 63-10. Passed 2-18-63.) 
1721.02 - Width and markings. 
    Fire lanes shall be of such width as is reasonably determined by the Chief of the Division of Fire as necessary to permit access and operation of fire-fighting equipment and personnel and the egress of occupants.

Any such permitted barricade or fence may not be locked in any manner. 
(Ord. 63-10. Passed 2-18-63.)

(Ord. 63-10. Passed 2-18-63.) 
1721.05 - Removal of obstructions.

(Ord. 63-10. Passed 2-18-63.) 
1721.06 - Notice and appeal. 
    Whenever the Chief of the Division of Fire designates a fire lane, written notice thereof shall be given to the owner, occupant or person in charge of the premises. Such designation may be appealed within ten days by filing a written objection to such designation with the Fire Chief. The appeal shall be heard by the members of Council, a majority of whom may affirm, disaffirm or modify the designation and whose decision shall be final. 
(Ord. 63-10. Passed 2-18-63.) 
1721.07 - Enforcement.

(Ord. 78-34. Passed 3-20-78.)

Each day of such violation or failure to comply shall constitute a separate offense. The imposition of a fine or penalty shall not excuse the violation or permit it to continue, and such violations shall be remedied.
