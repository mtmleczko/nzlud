CODE OF THE
CITY OF OGDENSBURG, NEW YORK
Updated 04-15-2019
i
City of Ogdensburg, NY
The City of Ogdensburg has, over the years, passed through a process of
legislative change common to many American communities. While only a few
simple laws were necessary at the time of the establishment of the City, subsequent
growth of the community, together with the complexity of modern life, has created
the need for new and more detailed legislation for the proper function and
government of the city. The recording of local law is an aspect of municipal
history, and as the community develops and changes, review and revision of old
laws and consideration of new laws, in the light of current trends, must keep pace.
The orderly collection of these records is an important step in this ever-continuing
process. Legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in
the pages of old records. It must be available and logically arranged for convenient
use and must be kept up-to-date. It was with thoughts such as these in mind that the
City Council ordered the following codification of the City's legislation.
Contents of Code
The various chapters of the Code contain all currently effective legislation (local
laws, ordinances and certain resolutions) of a general and permanent nature
enacted by the City Council of the City of Ogdensburg, including revisions or
amendments to existing legislation deemed necessary by the City Council in the
course of the codification.
Division of Code
The Code is divided into three (3) major divisions. The first division includes the
Charter of the city. The second division includes the Administrative Regulations of
the city as Part I. The third division includes all legislation of a general and
permanent nature as Parts II and III. Part II, Administrative Legislation, contains
all city legislation of an administrative nature, such as that dealing with the
administration of government, that establishing or regulating municipal
departments and that affecting officers and employees of the municipal
government and its departments. Part III, General Legislation, contains all other
city legislation of a regulatory nature. Items of legislation in this part generally
impose penalties for violation of their provisions, whereas those in Part II do not.
PREFACE
ii
City of Ogdensburg, NY
Grouping of Legislation and
Arrangement of Chapters
The various items of legislation are organized into chapters, their order being an
alphabetical progression from one subject to another. Wherever there are two or
more items of legislation dealing with the same subject, they are combined into a
single chapter. Thus, for example, all legislation pertaining to the regulation of
streets and sidewalks may be found in Part II, in the chapter entitled "Streets and
Sidewalks." In such chapters, use of Article or Part designations has preserved the
identity of the individual items of legislation.
Table of Contents
The Table of Contents details the alphabetical arrangement of material by chapter
as a means of identifying specific areas of legislation. Wherever two or more items
of legislation have been combined by the editor into a single chapter, titles of the
several Articles or Parts are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate
location of the individual item of legislation.
Reserved Chapters
Space has been provided in the Code for the convenient insertion, alphabetically,
of later enactments. In the Table of Contents such space appears as chapters
entitled "(Reserved)." In the body of the Code, reserved space is provided by
breaks in the page-numbering sequence between chapters.
Pagination
A unique page-numbering system has been used, in which each chapter forms an
autonomous unit. One hundred pages have been allotted to each chapter, and the
first page of each is the number of that chapter followed by the numerals "01."
Thus, Chapter 6 begins on page 601, Chapter 53 on page 5301, etc. By use of this
system, it is possible to add or to change pages in any chapter without affecting the
sequence of subsequent pages in other chapters, and to insert new chapters without
affecting the existing organization.
iii
City of Ogdensburg, NY
Numbering of Sections
A chapter-related section-numbering system is employed, in which each section
of every item of legislation is assigned a number which indicates both the number
of the chapter in which the legislation is located and the location of the section
within that chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 6 is § 6-1, while the fourth
section of Chapter 53 is § 53-4. New sections can then be added between existing
sections using a decimal system. Thus, for example, if two sections were to be
added between §§ 53-4 and 53-5, they would be numbered as §§ 53-4.1 and 53-
4.2.
Scheme
The Scheme is the list of section titles which precedes the text of each chapter.
These titles are carefully written so that, taken together, they may be considered as
a summary of the content of the chapter. Taken separately, each describes the
content of a particular section. For ease and precision of reference, the Scheme
titles are repeated as section headings in the text.
Histories
At the end of the Scheme in each chapter is located the legislative history for that
chapter. This History indicates the specific legislative source from which the
chapter was derived, including the enactment number (e.g., ordinance number,
local law number, bylaw number, resolution number, etc.), if pertinent, and the
date of adoption. In the case of chapters containing Parts or Articles derived from
more than one item of legislation, the source of each Part or Article is indicated in
the History. Amendments to individual sections or subsections are indicated by
histories where appropriate in the text.
Codification
Amendments and Revisions
New chapters adopted during the process of codification are specifically
enumerated in chapter Histories with reference to "Ch. 1, General Provisions,"
where the legislation adopting this Code and making such revisions will appear
after final enactment. Sections amended or revised are indicated in the text by
means of Editor's Notes referring to the chapter cited above.
iv
City of Ogdensburg, NY
General References; Editor's Notes
In each chapter containing material related to other chapters in the Code, a table
of General References is included to direct the reader's attention to such related
chapters. Editor's Notes are used in the text to provide supplementary information
and cross-references to related provisions in other chapters.
Appendix
Certain forms of local legislation are not of a nature suitable for inclusion in the
main body of the Code but are of such significance that their application is
community-wide or their provisions are germane to the conduct of municipal
government. The Appendix of this Code is reserved for such legislation and for
any other material that the community may wish to include.
Disposition List
The Disposition List is a chronological listing of legislation adopted since the
publication of the Code, indicating its inclusion in the Code or the reason for its
exclusion. The Disposition List will be updated with each supplement to the Code
to include the legislation reviewed with said supplement.
Index
The Index is a guide to information. Since it is likely that this Code will be used
by persons without formal legal training, the Index has been formulated to enable
such persons to locate a particular section quickly. Each section of each chapter
has been indexed. The Index will be supplemented and revised from time to time
as new legislation is added to the Code.
Instructions for
Amending the Code
All changes to the Code, whether they are amendments, deletions or complete
new additions, should be adopted as amending the Code. In doing so, existing
material that is not being substantively altered should not be renumbered. Where
new sections are to be added to a chapter, they can be added at the end of the
existing material (continuing the numbering sequence) or inserted between existing
sections as decimal numbers (e.g., a new section between §§ 45-5 and 45-6 should
be designated § 45-5.1). New chapters should be added in the proper alphabetical
sequence in the appropriate division or part (e.g., Part I, Administrative
v
City of Ogdensburg, NY
Legislation, or Part II, General Legislation), utilizing the reserved chapter
numbers. New chapter titles should begin with the key word for the alphabetical
listing (e.g., new legislation on abandoned vehicles should be titled "Vehicles,
Abandoned" under "V" in the table of contents, and a new enactment on coinoperated
amusement devices should be "Amusement Devices" or "Amusement
Devices, Coin-Operated" under "A" in the table of contents). Where a reserved
number is not available, an "A" chapter should be used (e.g., a new chapter to be
included between Chapters 45 and 46 should be designated Chapter 45A). New
Articles may be inserted between existing Articles in a chapter (e.g., adding a new
district to the Zoning Regulations) by the use of "A" Articles (e.g., a new Article to
be included between Articles XVI and XVII should be designated Article XVIA).
The section numbers would be as indicated above (e.g., if the new Article XVIA
contains six sections and existing Article XVI ends with § 45-30 and Article XVII
begins with § 45-31, Article XVIA should contain §§ 45-30.1 through 45-30.6).
Supplementation
Supplementation of the Code will follow the adoption of new legislation. New
legislation or amendments to existing legislation will be included and repeals will
be indicated as soon as possible after passage. Supplemental pages should be
inserted as soon as they are received and old pages removed, in accordance with
the Instruction Page which accompanies each supplement.
Acknowledgment
The assistance of the City officials is gratefully acknowledged by the editor. The
codification of the legislation of the City of Ogdensburg reflects an appreciation of
the needs of a progressive and expanding community. As in many other
municipalities, officials are faced with fundamental changes involving nearly every
facet of community life. Problems increase in number and complexity and range in
importance from everyday details to crucial areas of civic planning. It is the
profound conviction of General Code Publishers Corp. that this Code will
contribute significantly to the efficient administration of local government. As
Samuel Johnson observed, "The law is the last result of human wisdom acting
upon human experience for the benefit of the public."
Acknowledgment by Editor
The editors gratefully acknowledge Rebecca J. Claxton, CMC, for her assistance
in bringing this project to culmination.

longer by the first day of December, they shall be added, with accrued penalties, by the City
Comptroller to the tax rolls for the ensuing year against the proper delinquent parcels of taxable
property. Items thus added to the tax rolls shall become in all respects part of the tax levy and
subject to all the penalties applicable to such levy for nonpayment.
§ C-78. Unpaid charges to be added to tax rolls. [Amended 3-8-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]
A. Sewer rents, water bills, rubbish collection, lawn mowing charges, demolition, grading and
other special charges for municipal services relating to real property are due and payable
when billed and, if unpaid for 30 days or longer after the first day of December, shall be
added by the City Comptroller to the tax rolls for the ensuing year against the proper
delinquent parcels of taxable property. Items thus added to the tax rolls shall become in all
respects part of the tax levy and subject to the same penalties as provided for in § C-77.
B. As an alternative method of collecting unpaid charges for sewer rents, water bills, rubbish
collection, lawn mowing charges, demolition, grading or other special charges relating to real
property, the City of Ogdensburg may institute any action or proceeding authorized by law
against the property owner and/or recipient or beneficiary of said service. Said action or
proceeding may seek any remedy allowed by law.
§ C-79. (Reserved)
§ C-80. Recovery of unpaid taxes. [Amended 9-10-2007 by L.L. No. 3-2007]
All taxes and assessments charged upon real estate, including those for local improvements and
other charges, shall be a lien upon the same from the time of completing the tax roll therefor, and
such lien shall be prior and superior to all other liens and encumbrances. All such taxes,
assessments and other charges may also be recovered in an action brought by the City against
any person liable therefor and the lien thereof may be foreclosed by action in the same manner
and by the same proceedings as in an action for the foreclosure of a mortgage upon real estate. In
any action to recover any taxes or assessments or to foreclose the lien thereof, the assessment or
tax roll shall in all cases be prima facie evidence of the right of recovery of the amount of such
tax and assessment, and interest, and penalties, and no property shall be exempt from levy and
sale for the payment of the same. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Charter, tax liens
owned by the City and due and unpaid for at least two years from the date on which the tax and
other legal charges represented thereby became a lien shall be foreclosed by an action in rem in
accordance with Title 3 of Article 11 of the Real Property Tax Law.
§ C-81. Sale of property for nonpayment of tax. [Amended 6-12-1995 by L.L. No. 2-1995]
A. Whenever any tax or assessment, and the penalties and interest thereon, shall remain unpaid
nine months from the date of levy thereof, the Comptroller shall advertise and sell the real
estate charged therewith in accordance with the Real Property Tax Law. However, at such sale,
rates of interest shall be bid in multiples of 1% or a flat bid of no interest whatsoever and
parcels shall be bid and sold separately. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Comptroller
shall award such bill to the person bidding the lowest rate of interest or no interest. If more than
one person bids the same rate of interest, the Comptroller or other authorized person conducting
such sale shall sell the parcel to whichever of such bidders as he in his sole discretion shall
determine. In any case, however, and as to any parcel, the Comptroller may reject any and all
C: 34
OGDENSBURG CODE
bids and bid in and purchase the same for the City at the maximum rate of interest, in which
event the bid of the City shall be preferred over all other bids. The City shall likewise be
deemed the purchaser at the maximum rate of interest of all parcels which are not otherwise
sold at such sale.
B. Conveyance of the real estate; cancellation of the tax sale certificate.
(1) If any parcel or lot so sold shall not be redeemed as provided, the Comptroller, as soon
as is reasonably practical after the expiration of two years from the date said tax and
other charges shall become a lien, may execute and deliver to the purchaser, his heirs or
assigns or to the City or its assigns, as the case may be, a conveyance of the real estate
so sold, which conveyance shall vest in the grantee an estate in fee, subject only to the
liens, if any, of unpaid taxes, assessments or other charges levied pursuant to § C-78.
Alternatively, as soon as is reasonably practicable after the expiration of said two years,
where the City is the holder of the certificate of sale, the Comptroller may cancel the
certificate by a proper entry on the records of the Office of the Comptroller or on the
records of the County Clerk. The Comptroller may cancel said tax sale certificate for
one or more of the following reasons:
(a) There is reason to believe that there may be a legal impediment to the enforcement
of the tax lien affecting such parcel.
(b) The tax has been canceled or is subject to cancellation pursuant to § 558 of the Real
Property Tax Law or, in the case of a tax district to which such section does not
apply, the tax would be subject to cancellation if such section were applicable to the
tax district.
(c) The enforcement of the lien has been stayed by the filing of a petition pursuant to the
Bankruptcy Code of 1973 (Title Eleven of the United States Code).
(d) If the tax district were to acquire the parcel, there is a significant risk that it might be
exposed to a liability substantially in excess of the amount that could be recovered
by enforcing the tax lien.
(2) Upon the cancellation of the tax sale certificate, the Comptroller shall issue a certificate
of cancellation setting forth the facts which render the tax sale certificate eligible for
cancellation. The cancellation of the tax sale certificate shall have no effect upon the tax
lien or other liens against the affected parcel. On cancellation of said certificate, the City
may sue for the full amount due on the real estate as determined by the last day for
redemption and recover in an action against any person(s) and/or business entity liable
therefor. A judgment in such action in favor of the City shall not operate to release any
lien of such amount due on the real estate until fully satisfied.

application before the taxable status date with the City Assessor of the City and
simultaneously therewith files the application with the State Board of Equalization and
Assessment and the State Job Incentive Board.
B. Upon submission of the aforesaid application and proof, the City Assessor, with or without a
hearing, shall consider the application for such exemption and, if found to be in order,
determine the assessed value of the exemption in accordance with the certificate of eligibility
and enter such value on the exempt portion of the assessment roll.
C. The City Assessor, in his/her determination, shall grant a one-hundred-percent tax credit or
exemption, and the exemption as granted shall continue for five years only; and thereafter the
exemption shall be at the rate of 50% during the period of years so approved only if the
certificate of eligibility is not revoked or modified and is renewed or extended by the State
Job Incentive Board.
D. Any exemption so granted by the City Assessor shall commence with the assessment roll
prepared on the next following taxable status date of the City of Ogdensburg.
§ C-83. Remittance of county taxes. [Amended 2-26-1985 by L.L. No. 3-1985]
The City Comptroller shall remit to the County Treasurer county taxes collected by the office of
the City Comptroller. Remittances of currently due taxes actually collected shall be made on or
before May 25, August 25 and December 1 of each fiscal year. Taxes delinquent for more than
nine calendar months, plus applicable penalties and interest, shall be remitted to the
County Treasurer on or before the 30th day of the month during which said delinquent taxes are
actually collected.

General Provisions
§ AR-1. Purpose; approval and modification.
A. The City Charter gives the City Manager authority to "direct and supervise the administration
of all departments, offices and agencies of the City" (except as otherwise provided by Charter
or local law) and makes the City Manager "responsible to the Council for the administration
of all City affairs placed in his charge."
B. In discharging this responsibility, the City Manager will prepare Administrative Regulations,
which will be reviewed and revised as necessary by the City Council prior to
implementation. It shall be the purpose of these Administrative Regulations to provide
standard administrative policies and procedures to be followed uniformly by all City agencies
and departments.
C. All Administrative Regulations will be kept in loose leaf form by all departments, bureaus
and offices. Each City department must issue its own departmental procedural manual to
amplify and supplement these Administrative Regulations and to set forth practices peculiar
to the department.
D. These Administrative Regulations shall be approved and may be modified by a resolution of
the City Council.
§ AR-2. Relationship of administrative staff and Council.
A. The following policy is to be considered by all department heads as the basis for
relationships between the City administrative staff and the City Council:
(1) That the Council-Manager form of government be reaffirmed and supported by this
Council.
(2) That all matters considered by the Council be presented on an agenda prepared by the
City Manager who will recommend action to be taken in each specific case or by the
City Clerk in accordance with actions taken previously by the City Council. Items for
the agenda may originate in accordance with §§ AR-17 and AR-18.
(3) That all matters referred to the City Council by the Planning Board be placed on the City
Council agenda after Planning Board minutes and/or recommendation have been
furnished to members of the City Council.
(4) That the agenda be closed each Thursday noon, be prepared each Thursday and be
placed in the hands of each member of the City Council each Thursday night.
(5) That persons appearing before the City Council do so only in accordance with the above
agenda.
(6) That all instructions and directions to the Manager will come from the City Council as a
whole after approval of the majority of the City Council.
AR: 5
(7) That no instructions and/or directives will be given by the City Council or individual
Councillor to department heads or to other City employees who are directed to refer
such instructions immediately to the City Manager who in turn is directed to bring such
improper actions to the attention of the entire City Council for such action as may be
appropriate in each individual case.
B. Interpretation.
(1) Subsection A(1) through (6) above are self-explanatory.
(2) With reference to Subsection A(7):
(a) City Councillors will be expected to visit departments from time to time for the
purpose of inspecting and securing information concerning departmental operations
and problems, and the department heads are requested to fully cooperate with the
Councillors in requests for information where the same is immediately available.
However, any request for special studies, investigations or reports involving
considerable staff time for preparation shall be forwarded to the City Manager.
Depending upon the nature of the request, it may be necessary for the City Manager
to place the item on the agenda for action by the majority of the City Council.
(b) No Councillor will give any orders or directives, either directly or indirectly, to any
employees of the City government or interfere in the conduct of any department.
(c) No member of the administrative staff or employee of the City shall be summoned
for the purpose of inquiry relating to his conduct or the operation of the department,
except at the direction of the CityManager.
(d) All City employees are directed to report infractions of City Council policy to the
CityManager.

ARTICLE II
Personnel Policies and Procedures
§ AR-4. Purpose; conflicts with collective bargaining agreements.
A. The purpose of Article II of the Administrative Regulations is to define personnel policies
and procedures not addressed by City collective bargaining agreements. It is designed to be a
working guide for supervisory and staff personnel in the day-to-day administration of the
City's personnel program. Its purpose is also to standardize personnel practices and
procedures among all City departments.
B. These written policies should increase understanding, eliminate the need for ad hoc decisions
on matters of citywide policy, and help to assure uniform personnel administration. It is the
responsibility of each and every member of management to administer these policies in a
consistent and impartial manner.
C. Procedures and practices in the field of personnel relations are subject to modification and
further development in the light of experience. Each member of management can assist in
keeping our personnel program up to date by notifying the Personnel Aide (City Clerk) or
City Manager whenever problems are encountered or improvements can be made in the
administration of our personnel policies.
D. In the event that a provision of these regulations, either now or in the future, is found to be in
conflict with a collective bargaining agreement, the collective bargaining agreement shall
take precedence.
AR: 7
§ AR-5. Employment policies.
A. Equal employment opportunity. The City of Ogdensburg is an equal employment opportunity
employer. All decisions concerning employees and applicants for employment are made
without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or sexual
preference. The City complies with all applicable federal, state and local laws governing
nondiscrimination. The policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including
but not limited to hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of
absence, compensation and training.14 [Amended 9-11-1995]
B. Affirmative action. It is and shall continue to be the goal of the City to establish and maintain
an integrated and balanced work force with a sexual and racial composition similar to that of
the area's total labor force (see Council resolution dated January 22, 1979, Appendix A15)
C. Training and development. The City shall develop training programs and support career
education programs that provide academic knowledge and job skills for permanent
employees. Employees shall be encouraged to participate in career development programs.
Subject to budget limitations and department head approval, employees shall be afforded
time off from work to attend job related training and work schedules shall be adjusted to
allow regular classroom attendance.
§ AR-6. Employment procedures.
A. Personnel requisition. The first step to be followed in the process of filling a position is for a
department head to complete and submit to the City Manager a personnel requisition form
(see Appendix C16). The personnel requisition form certifies that the position must be filled,
that budgeted funds are available for the position and that the position has been authorized by
the City Council in the personal service detail of the City budget. One copy of the approved
form will be retained in the City Manager's office and one copy will be returned to
requisitioning department. If the position is a classified, budgeted position, then the
recruitment process may begin as soon as the requisition form is approved.
B. Position classification. New positions, informally authorized to be filled by the Manager, but
not previously classified by the St. Lawrence County Human Resources Department, must be
described on a position classification questionnaire. In addition, the department requesting the
new position should prepare a position description for St. Lawrence County Human Resources
Department review. The St. Lawrence County Human Resources Department will approve the
job specification and title and classify the position. Once the new position has been titled and
classified, the City Manager will request the City to amend the department's personnel service
detail and budget (if necessary). Only after the position has been appropriately titled, classified
and budgeted, will the City Manager sign the personnel requisition form, thereby authorizing
commencement of the recruiting process.
C. Recruiting. In accordance with the City's affirmative action plan, department heads shall
aggressively seek qualified minorities and women for all job levels, including professional,
supervisory and managerial positions. The City Clerk, who has been designated by the City
Manager as Personnel Aide and Affirmative Action Officer shall be responsible for
coordinating all recruitment efforts and for ensuring that affirmative action procedures are
followed (see Appendix A18).
D. Testing and selection.
AR: 8
(1) Department heads have the primary responsibility for the final selection of employees,
subject to the approval of the City Manager and subject to applicable rules and
regulations of the St. Lawrence County Human Resources Department. Department
heads will be appointed by the City Manager, subject to City Council approval.
Provisional appointments to competitive positions may be made in the absence of a civil
service list, but this practice shall be discouraged when the position requires expensive
on-the-job training that could be wasted if the provisional appointment is not made
permanent.
(2) All candidates for City positions must complete the standard New York State Civil
Service employment application form (see Appendix E19).
(3) All new permanent or probationary appointments shall be made subject to a preemployment
physical examination. In addition, appointments to uniform police and fire
positions shall be made subject to agility examinations. [Amended 1-11-2010 by Ord.
No. 1-2010]
(4) In order to reduce the City's exposure to unemployment, compensation claims, summer,
seasonal, temporary and part-time appointments shall be restricted to applicants who
provide evidence that they will be returning to school or other full-time employment
following their period of employment with theCity.
E. Appointments.
(1) Appointments shall be recorded on supplemental payroll certification and report of
personnel change forms, MSD 426, (see Appendix F20). New appointments, promotions,
suspensions, and forced terminations must be recorded on an MSD 426 form, which
must be signed by the Department Head and counter signed by the City Manager and St.
Lawrence County Human Resources Department. One copy of the approved MSD 426
shall be forwarded to the Payroll Office, a second copy will be forwarded to the
Personnel Office, and a third will be returned to the department.
(2) Appointees must report to the Payroll Clerk for employment processing prior to their
first day of scheduled City work. A checklist will be given to each new employee to
ensure that all enrollment materials have been issued and all benefit options explained
(see Appendix G21). [Amended 1-11-2010 by Ord. No. 1-2010]
§ AR-6.1. Seasonal employees.
A. Hiring preference. The following preference ranking will be assigned for the hiring of
seasonal or temporary student employees by departments within the City of Ogdensburg.
[Amended 9-9-2013 by Ord. No. 14-2013]
(1) First hiring preference: City of Ogdensburg residents.
(a) College students first (maximum four years of employment with the City as a
college student); then
(b) High school students over 16 years of age (maximum of two years of employment
with the City as a high school student).
(2) Second hiring preference: employees with previous satisfactory employment experience
AR: 9
with the City of Ogdensburg in the area that they are being considered for.
ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS
(3) Third hiring preference: where necessary skills, education or certification (for example,
lifesaving) is not available through the first or second preference categories, then
department heads are permitted to hire temporary employees residing within the
Enlarged Ogdensburg City School District. Should a qualified employee not be found
within the school district, department heads are free to hire from within St. Lawrence
County.
B. Internships. Where a college or university student is employed through an internship or co-op
program sponsored by that institution in the student's major field of study, the above
preference directive shall not pertain. However, an Ogdensburg City resident in such a
program should still receive priority over an intern applicant from another area.
C. Written evaluation. All seasonal and/or temporary employees shall be evaluated at the end of
their term of employment by their supervisor and/or department head using the appended
evaluation form.22 Such employees shall be rehired for future temporary terms only with a
satisfactory evaluation from a preceding term of employment.
§ AR-7. Employment records.
A. Central records.
(1) A single personnel file on each employee shall be maintained by the St. Lawrence
County Human Resources Department. Each personnel file shall contain the following
only:

correspondence relevant to examination.
(b) Copies of all MSD 426 forms.
(c) Annual performance evaluations.
(d) Letters of reprimand and commendation.
(e) Medical and civil service test results and certified civil service lists.
(2) In addition, the Personnel Aide shall maintain a permanent historical record (roster card)
of each employee's appointment, position changes, salary increases, civil service status,
etc.
(3) Payroll withholding forms, including W-4's, union deductions, savings bond deductions
and deductions for life insurance, disability insurance, sick and accident insurance,
supplemental life insurance and insurance enrollment cards shall be maintained by the
Payroll Clerk in the Department of Finance. The Payroll Clerk shall also maintain
retirement enrollment records.
22 Editor's Note: The evaluation form is on file in the office of the CityManager.
AR: 10
OGDENSBURG CODE
B. Record maintenance. All personnel records shall be reviewed by the Personnel Aide at least
once every three years. Performance evaluations and letters of reprimand or commendation
or related materials that are more than five years old shall be removed from the file and
returned to the employee. Unsubstantiated complaints against an employee should not be
retained after an adequate investigation of the complaint has been conducted.
C. Record access.
(1) Employees shall be entitled to review and receive copies (upon request) of all materials
within their personnel file. Only the employee's immediate supervisor, department head,
City Manager and Personnel Aide may have access to an individual's personnel file.
(2) Employees shall have the right to insert in their personnel file a response or explanation
to any item contained in their file.
§ AR-8. Performance evaluations.
A. Every employee of the City shall receive at least an annual evaluation of their job
performance. Every probationary employee shall receive at least a quarterly job performance
evaluation.
B. Performance evaluations shall be used for the following purposes:
(1) For feedback and counseling, specifically for determining areas of employee
dissatisfaction, frustration, etc.; for eliciting employee suggestions for improvements to
the work environment, work flow, productivity, etc.
(2) For commending the employee for work well done or particularly strong performance
and for pointing out areas of job performance that need improvement.
(3) For identification of training needs and career aspirations, for identifying what
additional training employees believe they need for their present job and for their next
job; and for providing an opportunity for supervisors to discuss with employees areas
where they think additional training would be helpful.
(4) For establishing performance goals and objectives so that employees have a clear
understanding as to what is expected of them and so that performance can be objectively
evaluated.
(5) For future promotions and job transfers where the competition for a promotion or
transfer is between two or more qualified individuals.
(6) For disciplinary documentation to record failure to meet established performance
objectives or behavioral standards (chronic tardiness, excess absenteeism, etc.).
(7) For merit pay increases, as per the City Executive Compensation Program.
AR: 11
ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS
C. Evaluation procedures.
(1) A standard evaluation form is provided for use by supervisors (Appendix A);23 however,
the actual form used (if any) and the evaluation procedure followed shall be left to the
discretion of each department head, since specific performance requirements and skills
vary between departments. Evaluation procedures must, however, be applied uniformly
and consistently within each department. All forms must conform to the standards as
described in the City's executive compensation program.
(2) At a minimum, an annual counseling session with each employee shall be held for the
purpose of discussing the employee's job performance and supervisor's evaluation. In
lieu of a formal evaluation form, a written summary of the counseling session may be
prepared by the supervisor for filing in the employee's personnel file. Where more than
one individual supervises an employee, each supervisor should participate in the
evaluation process.
§ AR-9. Executive compensation program.
A. Salary administration policies.
(1) Introduction.
(a) The basic purpose of the administrative salary program is to ensure that the City of
Ogdensburg is able to attract, retain and motivate competent non-represented
personnel. To this purpose, the following five objectives are established for the
executive compensation program:
[1] To establish a salary and benefits structure that is competitive in the external
marketplace.
[2] To establish proper internal position relationships based on job content and
responsibilities.
[3] To provide a system whereby individual salary increases are related to
satisfactory performance and to experience in title.
[4] To provide a system that allows management to take proper salary action within
prescribed limits.
[5] To provide an annual administrative budget based on objective criteria such as
cost-of-living factors, market conditions, negotiated settlement with the CSEA
salaried unit and the City's ability to pay increased salaries and benefits.
(b) All administrative positions not represented by a collective bargaining agreement
will be covered.
(2) Maintaining a competitive position in themarketplace.
23 Editor's Note: The standard evaluation form(Appendix A) is on file in the office of the City Manager.
AR: 12
OGDENSBURG CODE
(a) To implement this policy, the administrative salary structure will be reviewed
annually by the City Manager and Executive Compensation Committee (appointed
by the Mayor and Council). Such review will include consideration of:
[1] Published salary information.
[2] Specialized municipal salary surveys that would provide pertinent and specific
information.
[3] Consumer price index changes from the previous year.
(b) This Executive Compensation Committee will also be responsible to maintain proper
internal position relationships.
(c) The Executive Compensation Committee consisting of three Council members
shall be appointed by the Mayor and City Council, for one-year terms, at each
January 1 reorganizational meeting. [Amended 11-10-2014 by Ord. No.
15-2014]
(d) Each year, the salary ranges for each position will be adjusted for Tier I employees
within the CSEA salaried unit. Such an increase for non-represented employees will
take place at the same time as it does for said CSEA employees. A percentage
adjustment to the range will be reflected also for each step in that range.
(e) Adjustments will be effective January 1 of the new fiscal year, to the extent that the
negotiated CSEA salaried contract is also effective on that date.
(f) Salary increases will be administered as outlined in Part II of this program.
(3) Starting salaries.
(a) A newly hired or promoted employee with minimal experience is normally assigned
a salary at the minimum of the salary range. Starting salaries in excess of the
minimum may be warranted because of experience and current market condition.
Newly hired or promoted employees may receive a salary below minimum of the
established range if such action is felt justified by the immediate supervisor and City
Manager. However, the salary level should be increased to at least the minimum of
the range within three to six months after hire or promotion, following a successful
evaluation.
(b) A starting salary within the middle 50% of the range would be warranted if the
following conditions exist:
[1] The scarcity of well-qualified individuals makes it impossible to hire the desired
candidate at a lesser salary.
[2] The level of experience and competence exceeds that of other administrative
personnel in salary range whose compensation is less than that of the candidate.
AR: 13
ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS
[3] The level of experience is equal to that of other administrative personnel in the
position or range.
[4] Indications of professional competence and achievement from an accreditation
agency such as a professional engineer's license, a CPA, a CMC, Certified
Manager, AICP, etc.
(c) Starting salaries above the midpoint of the range must be approved by the City
Manager before a salary offer is extended.
(4) Progression through the salary range.
(a) Employees will progress through the salary range on the basis of satisfactory
performance. Personnel will be reviewed annually by the City Manager or their
immediate supervisor.
(b) If it is determined that a person's performance does not warrant a salary increase, he
or she will be counseled by the immediate supervisor, and a date will be established
at which time performance will again be reviewed. If there has been no improvement
in performance by the next review date, termination may be considered.
(5) Position descriptions.
(a) A description will be prepared and maintained for each administrative position.
(b) The description will contain a summary of responsibilities and basic goals and
objectives of the position.
(c) Descriptions will be reviewed annually by an individual designated by the City
Manager to determine if there has been any substantial change in responsibility.
(6) Reclassification of positions.
(a) It is recognized that from time to time changes in responsibility may warrant
reclassification of a position into a higher (or lower) grade level.
(b) The following procedures will be followed in requesting reclassification of a
position:
[1] A new description will be prepared by the recommending supervisor and
submitted to the City Manager or his or her designee;
[2] The Executive Compensation Committee will review the position to determine
the proper grade level, and a recommendation on the grade level will be made
by the City Manager; and
[3] Reclassification will not be effective without approval of the City Manager and
the City Council.
AR: 14
OGDENSBURG CODE
(c) A position will not be reclassified in a higher level grade merely to support a salary
increase for an individual. There must be a measurable change of responsibilities
that can be compared with other positions in the recommended grade level.
(d) In some instances, new or increased responsibilities may be reflected in an annual
flat-rate stipend.
B. Administration of the executive compensation system. The City Manager will be responsible
for administration and maintenance of the executive compensation system.
(1) Step/grade schedule.
(a) Schedule A reflects the 1990 non-represented employees salary schedule with
respective schedule steps underlined for each position.24
(b) Each step on each schedule will be adjusted by the negotiated percentage increase as
applied to the Tier I CSEA salaried unit schedule; such adjustments will be made
effective with that of the CSEA salaried unit.
(c) Each position covered by these policies will have a job-specific performance
evaluation to be filled out annually for each individual on or before December 15. A
satisfactory evaluation will be required as a prerequisite for movement from Step A
to Step B. All increases covered by this section will be effective with the CSEA
salaried unit negotiated contract. Personnel hired or promoted to a new position after
July 1 will not be eligible for movement from step to step during the following
calendar year. The City Manager will be responsible for the development or
amendment of the format used to establish satisfactory or unsatisfactory
performance.
(2) Salary approval process.
(a) The Executive Compensation Committee will evaluate and establish the salary level
for the City Manager based on performance and external market trends.
(b) The form and content of the City Manager's evaluation conducted by the Executive
Committee shall be determined by the Executive Compensation Committee.
(c) The City Manager will approve the evaluation and salary increases for the
individuals covered by this policy (all non-agreement personnel) in accordance with
established increase guidelines.
(d) It will be the responsibility of the City Manager to review and monitor all salary
increase recommendations for consistency and equity.
24 Editor's Note: Schedule A and the annual adjustments are on file in the City Comptroller's office.
AR: 15
ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS
(3) Promotional increases. Personnel promoted to a higher salary grade will receive an
increase at the time of promotion (and will be reviewed annually thereafter). The basic
adjustment will be at least the minimum of the new salary grade.
(4) Salaries above the range maximum.
(a) Personnel will not be paid beyond the maximum of the approved salary range except
in rare and unusual circumstances and on the approval of the Executive
Compensation Committee and the City Council. Salaries paid above the maximum
of the salary range will be considered "red circle rates."
(b) Except in rare and unusual circumstances, personnel paid at these rates will not
receive additional increases until the salary range for their position exceeds their
current base compensation level. Occasionally the market demand may warrant
salaries beyond the established range maximum. These will be handled on an
exception basis. Before any employment offer or salary increase recommendation is
made in such cases, it will be the responsibility of the City Manager to ensure that
the recommendation is justified and will not adversely affect established internal
salary relationships.
§ AR-10. Distribution of payroll checks.
A. All undelivered paychecks are to be returned to the City Treasurer's office not later than one
working day subsequent to the day on which paychecks are distributed, except in cases where
an employee's supervisor has knowledge that an employee will return to work within 48
hours.
B. Employees who wish to obtain their paychecks prior to the designated payday must satisfy
the following criteria:
(1) Employees must have an approval for a vacation, personal or compensation day off on
the payday.
(2) Employees obtain prior approval for an early check from the supervisor.
(3) Paychecks will never be dated earlier than their regular day.
(4) Employees are to receive their paychecks from their supervisors only.
(5) The Finance Department can only release paychecks to designated management
personnel.
§ AR-11. Overtime administration.
A. When the work of a department cannot be completed during the regularly scheduled work
period or if unusual conditions arise, a supervisor may ask an employee to work extra hours.

(2) Monthly overtime report. On a monthly basis, the department head is to report to the
City Manager the following:
(a) Monthly overtime expenditure.
(b) Year-to-date overtime expenditure.
(c) Year end projection of overtime expenditure.
§ AR-12. Workers' compensation for non-uniformed personnel.
A. Policy. All non-uniformed part-time, temporary, seasonal and full-time employees are
covered by workers' compensation insurance for any injury occurring on the job. Workers'
compensation insurance shall be provided through the self-insurance pool administered by
Saint Lawrence County.
B. Compensation procedure.
(1) Department heads must complete and sign a C-2 form (see Appendix A26) when
informed of an on-duty injury. If there is any doubt as to the validity of the claim,
phraseology must be used such as "it is alleged by the employee that . . . . ." or "the
employee claims that . . . . ." If the validity of the claim is questioned, a note should be
attached to the claim drawing attention to any possible discrepancy. Five copies of the
C-2 form must be completed and submitted to the Comptroller's office for distribution as
follows: one copy (original) to the New York State Worker's Compensation Board, one
copy to the Administrator of the County Plan, one copy to the City Attorney, one copy
to the Personnel Office and one copy to the City Manager's office.
25 Editor's Note: The memo dated 7-24-1984 is on file in the office of the CityManager.
26 Editor's Note: The C-2 form (Appendix A) is on file in the office of the CityManager.
AR: 17
ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS
(2) During the first seven days following the incident, the employee's absence shall be
charged to accumulated sick leave.
(3) If the absence is greater than seven days, but less than 15 days, workers' compensation
will reimburse the City for 66 2/3% of the employee's salary (up to $215 per week) for
Days 8 to 14 (assuming the injury is found to be compensable). The employee's sick
leave accrual should be credited with 66 2/3% of the sick days used between Day 8 and
Day 14.
(4) If the absence is 15 days or longer, worker's compensation will reimburse the City for
66 2/3% of the employee's salary from Day 1. The employee's sick leave accrual should,
therefore, be credited with 66 2/3% of the sick days used during the entire period of
compensable absence.
(5) If or when accumulated sick leave is exhausted, the employee will only receive a
maximum allowable workers' compensation allowance. The City will continue to
contribute towards the employee's individual and dependent healthcare coverage during
a compensable absence.
(6) All medical claims incurred as a result of a compensable injury must be submitted to and
will be paid by workers' compensation.
(7) Departmental operating budgets will be reimbursed by any salary payments received
from workers' compensation.
§ AR-13. Workers' compensation for uniformed personnel.
A. Policy. All uniformed personnel are covered by workers' compensation benefits under
General Municipal Law § 207-a (fire personnel) and § 207-c (police personnel), which call
for full salary payments during the period of compensable absence (until retirement).
B. Compensation procedure.
(1) Department heads must complete and sign a C-2 form when informed of an on-duty
injury. Any injury that might conceivably be permanently disabling must also be
reported to the State Retirement System (return receipt requested). If there is any doubt
as to the validity of the claim, phraseology must be used such as "it is alleged by the
employee that . . . . ." or "the employee claims that . . . . ." If the validity of the claim is
questioned, a note should be attached to the claim drawing attention to any possible
discrepancy. Five copies of the C-2 form must be completed and submitted to the
Comptroller's office for distribution as follows: one copy (original) to the New York
State Worker's Compensation Board, one copy to the Administrator of the County Plan,
one copy to the City Attorney, one copy to the City Manager's office.
AR: 18
OGDENSBURG CODE
(2) Unless the validity of the claim is questioned, the employee's accumulated sick leave
will not be charged during the compensable absence. If the validity of the claim is
questioned, the employee's accumulated sick time will be charged until the validity of
the claim is established. If the claim is then found to be valid, the employee's
accumulated sick leave will be credited for sick time used as a result of the injury.
(3) The employee will remain on the payroll at full pay until he or she is able to return to
work.
(4) During a compensable absence, the City will continue to contribute towards the
employee's individual and dependent healthcare coverage.
(5) All medical claims incurred as a result of a compensable injury must be submitted to and
will be paid by workers' compensation.
(6) Departmental operating budgets will be reimbursed by any salary payments received
from workers' compensation.
(7) Immediately upon a determination that a compensable injury will be permanently
disabling, the employee or the department head shall make an application to the New
York State Retirement System for accidental disability retirement.

§ AR-20. Suggestion award program.
A. Policy. The purpose of the City's suggestion award programs is to recognize and reward
nonsupervisory employees for suggestions that lead to more efficient and effective means of
delivering municipal services.
B. Suggestion procedures.
(1) Suggestion will be recorded on forms that may be obtained from department heads and
union officials (see Appendix A28). No unsigned suggestions will be considered by the
Merit Award Board, consisting of the Mayor, City Manager, City Attorney and two
union representatives appointed by the City Manager. Suggestions shall be submitted
directly to the CityManager.
(2) The following criteria shall be considered by the Board when reviewing suggestions:
(a) Is it practical? Does it use existing technology? Can it be accomplished under
existing legal and contractual obligations?
(b) Is it cost effective? Do projected savings outweigh projected implementation costs?
(c) Can it be implemented within the present City operating budget?
(3) If these questions can be answered affirmatively, the City Manager will assign
implementation responsibilities.
(4) After a three-month trial period, the effectiveness and/or efficiencies projected will be
evaluated by the City Manager or his designee. The resulting evaluation report will be
reviewed by the Merit Award Board.
(5) Based upon the evaluation report, the Board shall agree on the size and amount of the
award, if any, to be presented. Decisions of the Board shall be final.
§ AR-21. Interdepartmental coordination.
This policy is for the purpose of developing closer coordination between the various departments
of City government.
A. Where two or more departments are involved in a project or work program, coordination
should be established between department heads at the department level, either through the
department head or his/her subordinates. The administrative personnel of the various
departments should be instructed that if disagreements develop between departments during
the course of the work, the department heads involved should endeavor to resolve the matter,
but if that is not possible, the point in controversy should be referred to the City Manager for
decision either by memorandum or at a conference.
AR: 27
ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS
B. Where the City Manager has requested recommendations from a department head on certain
matters and another department or departments may be affected by his/her decision, the
answering department is instructed to send a copy of the memorandum addressed to the City
Manager to the other department or departments which may be concerned, or to call the
attention of the City Manager to the fact in the memorandum that another department may be
concerned with the decision.
C. Where the department head originates a recommendation to the City Manager on any subject,
if another department may be affected by the decision, he/she should send a copy of the
memorandum to the department head who may be affected, or call to the attention of the City
Manager in the memorandum that a decision in this matter may affect another department or
departments.
D. The department head receiving a copy of a memorandum from another department should
promptly advise the City Manager by alerting him to the problem areas affecting various
departments and to encourage closer coordination between the various departments. Any
conflict between the policies or programs of two or more different departments should be
brought to the attention of the City Manager immediately.
§ AR-22. Reporting of street and sidewalk defects.
A. One source of some major problems is the minor trouble spot that too long has been
neglected. The City and its employees usually provide service as quickly as the need is noted.
But too often a street defect, an inoperative traffic signal, defective sidewalk or other minor
problem goes unreported because no one has taken the time to call the proper City
department.
B. An appropriate form should be distributed to the drivers of every City vehicle by each
department. On most occasions it will take only a minute to note the trouble spot, its nature
and the address. Drivers should give these to their department or division head for
forwarding to the department involved.
C. Each department and division head is asked to instruct those employees driving City cars and
trucks to keep alert for such trouble spots and to report them. Drivers should be instructed to:
(1) Note the date.
(2) State the location: "The following street defect at. . ."
(3) State the nature: "Defect noticed."
(4) Sign the form by name and department.
D. An effective operating policy of this nature is one of the many ways through which the
departments and divisions can create a good public attitude towards the City of Ogdensburg
and must be considered as an important part of a public relations program.
AR: 28
OGDENSBURG CODE
§ AR-23. City staff interactions with citizens.
A. At various times, members of the City staff are called upon to have contact with members of
the public. Staff members are to conduct themselves as representatives of the City of

rules of basic human conduct.
B. However, it is recognized that staff members themselves are entitled to the same courteous

privately only for the purposes of rendering services authorized herein or by the Code of the City

Purchasing Policy
§ AR-39. Legislative authority.
Section 104-b of the General Municipal Law, effective January 1, 1992, required all
municipalities and districts therein to adopt procurement policies for goods and services which
are not required by law to be publicly bid. This regulation sets forth standard City-wide
procedures for ordering and purchasing services and supplies.
§ AR-40. General policies.
A. It is and shall remain the policy of the City that all City purchases of goods and services shall
be made without regard to the age, sex, race, religion, color, national origin, physical
handicap or political affiliation of the vendor or provider of services.
OGDENSBURG CODE
B. Provided quality and service are at least comparable, it is and shall remain the policy of the
City that all City purchases of goods and services shall be made at the lowest possible price
available.
C. Provided quality, service and price are at least comparable, preference in purchases will be
given to vendors who have a place of business within the City limits of Ogdensburg.
§ AR-41. Procedures.
A. Every purchase made will be initially reviewed to determine whether it is a purchase contract
or a public works contract. Once that determination is made, a good faith effort will be made
to determine whether it is known or can reasonably be expected that the aggregate amount to
be spent on the item of supply or service is not subject to competitive bidding, taking into
account past purchases and the aggregate amount to be spent in a year. The following items
are not subject to competitive bidding pursuant to § 103 of the General Municipal Law:
purchase contracts under $20,00037 and public works contracts under $35,00038; emergency
purchases; goods purchased from agencies for the blind or severely handicapped; goods
purchased from correctional institutions; purchases under state and county contracts; and
surplus and secondhand purchases from another governmental entity.
B. The decision that a purchase is not subject to competitive bidding will be documented in
writing by the individual making the purchase. This documentation may include written or
verbal quotes from vendors, a memo from the purchaser indicating how the decision was
arrived at, a copy of the contract indicating the source which makes the item or service
exempt or a memo from the purchaser detailing the circumstances which led to an emergency
purchase.
C. All goods and services, except those goods and services purchased through a county or state
contract, from agencies for the blind or severely handicapped, from correctional institutions
or purchases pursuant to Subsection G of this policy, will be secured by use of written
requests for proposals, written quotations, verbal quotations or any other method that assures
that goods will be purchased at the lowest price and that favoritism will be avoided.
D. Method of purchase. [Amended 9-13-10 by Council resolution]
(1) The following method of purchase will be used in order to achieve the highest savings,
except purchase contracts under $20,000 and public works contracts under $35,000;
goods purchased from agencies for the blind or severely handicapped; goods purchased
from correctional institutions; purchases under state and county contracts; or purchases
pursuant to Subsection G of this policy:
AR: 50
Estimated Amount of Purchase Contract Method
$250 to $2,999 2 verbal quotations
$3,000 to $19,999 3 written/fax quotations or
ADMINISTRATIVE
REGULATIONS
Estimated Amount of Public Works Contract Method
$250 to $2,999 2 verbal quotations
$3,000 to $4,999 2 written/fax quotations
$5,000 to $34,999 3 written/fax quotations or
Written request for proposals
(2) A good faith effort shall be made to obtain the required number of alternate proposals. If
the purchaser is unable to obtain the required number of alternate proposals, the
purchaser will document the attempt made at obtaining the proposals. But, in no event
shall the failure to obtain the proposals be a bar to the procurement.
E. Documentation is required of each quotation or proposal taken in connection with each
procurement.
F. Documentation and an explanation is required whenever a contract is awarded to other than
the lowest responsible offeror. This documentation will include an explanation of how the
award will achieve savings. The purchaser will be responsible for determining if the offeror
is responsible.
G. In the following circumstances it is not in the best interests of the City of Ogdensburg to
solicit quotations or document the basis for not accepting the lowest bid. In these
circumstances, the individual or company must be chosen based on accountability, reliability,
responsibility, skill, education and training, judgment, integrity, moral worth and the ability
to have a close relationship with the governing body. These qualifications are not necessarily
found in the individual or company that offers the lowest price and the nature of these
services are such that they do not readily lend themselves to competitive procurement
procedures. The citizens of the municipality deserve the benefit of expertise in these types of
services as it may ultimately save the taxpayers money.
(1) Service of an attorney.
(2) Services of a physician.
(3) Technical services of an engineer or architect engaged to prepare plans, maps, estimates
or other technical consultant services.
(4) Securing insurance coverage and/or services of an insurance broker.

H. In addition, in the following situations it is not in the best interests of the municipality to
secure alternate proposals because of the time required and type of purchase:

(2) Purchases of surplus and secondhand goods pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 6, of the
General Municipal Law;
(3) Purchases under $250; and
(4) Goods and services with sole source vendors.
I. PIGGYBACKING - General Municipal Law §103(16) allows procurement of certain goods
(including apparatus, materials, equipment and supplies) and services through contracts let by
the United States or any agency thereof, any state or any other political subdivision or district
therein, if such contract was let in a manner consistent with competitive bidding, and has been
made available for use by other governmental agencies. Approval for the use of “piggybacking”
will be through the City Manager in collaboration with the City Attorney.
J. BEST VALUE – Pursuant to General Municipal Law § 103(1) purchase contracts or public
works contracts (except those subject to New York State Labor Law Article 8) may be awarded
on the basis of the Best Value to the Offeror that optimizes quality, cost and efficiency, among
responsive and responsible Offerors. Best Value solicitations shall prescribe the minimum
specifications or requirements that must be met in order to be considered responsive and shall
describe and disclose the general manner in which the evaluation and selection shall be
conducted. The Basis of Award of the solicitation shall identify the relative importance and/or
weight of cost and the overall technical criterion to be considered by a Procuring Agency in its
determination of Best Value. The evaluation may also identify a quantitative factor for small
businesses or certified minority-or women-owned business enterprises, as defined in Executive
Law §300 (1), (7), (15) and (20). The basis of Award shall reflect, wherever possible, objective
and quantifiable analysis. Documentation in the Procurement Record shall, where practicable,
include a quantification of the application of the evaluation criteria to the rating of proposals and
the evaluation results, or, where not practicable, such other justification which demonstrates that
Best Value will be achieved. If Best Value is authorized as a procurement method eligible for
piggybacking consideration, then any potential piggyback contract should be evaluated for
substantial compliance with the above. All procurements based upon Best Value are subject to
review and/or approval by the City Manager or their designee.
K. This policy shall go into effect January 1, 1992, and will be reviewed annually.

AR- 73. RESPONSIBILITIES OF CITY EMPLOYEES.
AR- 74. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CITY.
§AR-71 HARASSMENT PROHIBITED.
The City of Ogdensburg is committed to maintaining a workplace free from sexual harassment.
Sexual harassment is a form of workplace discrimination. All employees are required to work in a
manner that prevents sexual harassment in the workplace. This Policy is one component of the City
of Ogdensburg’s commitment to a discrimination-free work environment. Sexual harassment is
against the law1 and all employees have a legal right to a workplace free from sexual harassment
and employees are urged to report sexual harassment by filing a complaint internally with the
appropriate designee as outlined in Policy, Section 3 below. Employees can also file a complaint
with a government agency or in court under federal, state or local antidiscrimination laws.
A. The City of Ogdensburg’s policy applies to all employees, applicants for employment,
interns, whether paid or unpaid, contractors and persons conducting business, regardless of
immigration status, with the City. In the remainder of this document, the term “employees”
refers to this collective group and the term “city” refers to the City of Ogdensburg.
B. Sexual harassment will not be tolerated. Any employee or individual covered by this policy
who engages in sexual harassment or retaliation will be subject to remedial and/or
disciplinary action (e.g., counseling, suspension, termination).
C. Retaliation Prohibition: No person covered by this Policy shall be subject to adverse action
because the employee reports an incident of sexual harassment, provides information, or
otherwise assists in any investigation of a sexual harassment complaint. The City will not
tolerate such retaliation against anyone who, in good faith, reports or provides information
about suspected sexual harassment. Any employee of the City who retaliates against anyone
involved in a sexual harassment investigation will be subjected to disciplinary action, up to
and including termination. All employees, paid or unpaid interns, or non-employees2
working in the workplace who believe they have been subject to such retaliation should
inform their direct supervisor, department head, Safety Committee Chair or City Manager.
All employees, paid or unpaid interns or non-employees who believe they have been a
target of such retaliation may also seek relief in other available forums, as explained below
in the section on Legal Protections.
D. Sexual harassment is offensive, is a violation of our policies, is unlawful, and may subject
the City to liability for harm to targets of sexual harassment. Harassers may also be
individually subject to liability. Employees of every level who engage in sexual harassment,
including department heads and supervisors who engage in sexual harassment or who allow
such behavior to continue, will be penalized for such misconduct.
E. The City will conduct a prompt and thorough investigation that ensures due process for all
parties, whenever management receives a complaint about sexual harassment, or otherwise
knows of possible sexual harassment occurring. The City will keep the investigation
confidential to the extent possible. Effective corrective action will be taken whenever sexual
harassment is found to have occurred. All employees, including department heads and
supervisors, are required to cooperate with any internal investigation of sexual harassment.
F. All employees are encouraged to report any harassment or behaviors that violate this policy.
The City will provide all employees a complaint form for employees to report harassment
and file complaints.
G. Department heads and supervisors are required to report any complaint that they receive, or
any harassment that they observe or become aware of, to the City Manager.
H. This policy applies to all employees, paid or unpaid interns, and non-employees and all
must follow and uphold this policy. This policy must be provided to all employees and
1 While this policy specifically addresses sexual harassment, harassment because of and discrimination against persons of all protected
classes is prohibited. In New York State, such classes include age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, military status,
sex, disability, marital status, domestic violence victim status, gender identity and criminal history.
2 A non-employee is someone who is (or is employed by) a contractor, subcontractor, vendor, consultant, or anyone providing services
in the workplace. Protected non-employees include persons commonly referred to as independent contractors, “gig” workers and
temporary workers. Also included are persons providing equipment repair, cleaning services or any other services provided pursuant to
a contract with the employer.
should be posted prominently in all work locations to the extent practicable (for example, in
a main office, not an offsite work location) and be provided to employees upon hiring.
§AR- 72. SEXUAL HARASSMENT DEFINED.
A. Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination and is unlawful under federal, state, and
(where applicable) local law. Sexual harassment includes harassment on the basis of sex,
sexual orientation, self-identified or perceived sex, gender expression, gender identity and
the status of being transgender.
B. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome conduct which is either of a sexual nature, or which
is directed at an individual because of that individual’s sex when:
1. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an
individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive
work environment, even if the reporting individual is not the intended target of
the sexual harassment;
2. Such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of
employment; or
3. Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for employment
decisions affecting an individual’s employment.
4. A sexually harassing hostile work environment includes, but is not limited to,
words, signs, jokes, pranks, intimidation or physical violence which are of a
sexual nature, or which are directed at an individual because of that individual’s
sex. Sexual harassment also consists of any unwanted verbal or physical
advances, sexually explicit derogatory statements or sexually discriminatory
remarks made by someone which are offensive or objectionable to the recipient,
which cause the recipient discomfort or humiliation, which interfere with the
recipient’s job performance.
C. Sexual harassment also occurs when a person in authority tries to trade job benefits for
sexual favors. This can include hiring, promotion, continued employment or any other
terms, conditions or privileges of employment. This is also called “quid pro quo”
harassment.
D. Any employee who feels harassed should report so that any violation of this policy can be
corrected promptly. Any harassing conduct, even a single incident, can be addressed under
this policy.
E. Examples of sexual harassment
The following describes some of the types of acts that may be unlawful sexual harassment
and that are strictly prohibited:
1. Physical acts of a sexual nature, such as:
a. Touching, pinching, patting, kissing, hugging, grabbing, brushing against
another employee’s body or poking another employee’s body;
b. Rape, sexual battery, molestation or attempts to commit these assaults.
2. Unwanted sexual advances or propositions, such as:
a. Requests for sexual favors accompanied by implied or overt threats
concerning the target’s job performance evaluation, a promotion or other
job benefits or detriments;
b. Subtle or obvious pressure for unwelcome sexual activities.
3. Sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks or jokes, or comments about a person’s
sexuality or sexual experience, which create a hostile work environment.
4. Sex stereotyping occurs when conduct or personality traits are considered
inappropriate simply because they may not conform to other people's ideas or
perceptions about how individuals of a particular sex should act or look.
5. Sexual or discriminatory displays or publications anywhere in the workplace, such
as:
a. Displaying pictures, posters, calendars, graffiti, objects, promotional
material, reading materials or other materials that are sexually demeaning
or pornographic. This includes such sexual displays on workplace
computers or cell phones and sharing such displays while in the workplace.
6. Hostile actions taken against an individual because of that individual’s sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity and the status of being transgender, such as:
a. Interfering with, destroying or damaging a person’s workstation, tools or
equipment, or otherwise interfering with the individual’s ability to perform
the job;
b. Sabotaging an individual’s work;
c. Bullying, yelling, name-calling.
F. Who can be a target of sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment can occur between any individuals, regardless of their sex or gender.
New York Law protects employees, paid or unpaid interns, and non-employees, including
independent contractors, and those employed by companies contracting to provide services
in the workplace. Harassers can be a superior, a subordinate, a coworker or anyone in the
workplace including an independent contractor, contract worker, vendor, client, customer or
visitor.
G. Where can sexual harassment occur?
Unlawful sexual harassment is not limited to the physical workplace itself. It can occur
while employees are traveling for business or at employer sponsored events or parties.
Calls, texts, emails, and social media usage by employees can constitute unlawful
workplace harassment, even if they occur away from the workplace premises, on personal
devices or during non-work hours.
§AR- 73. RESPONSIBILITIES OF CITY EMPLOYEES.
Reporting Sexual Harassment
A. Preventing sexual harassment is everyone’s responsibility. The City cannot prevent or
remedy sexual harassment unless it knows about it. Any employee, paid or unpaid intern or
non-employee who has been subjected to behavior that may constitute sexual harassment is
encouraged to report such behavior to their direct supervisor, department head, Safety
Committee Chair or City Manager. Anyone who witnesses or becomes aware of potential
instances of sexual harassment should report such behavior to their direct supervisor,
department head, Safety Committee Chair or City Manager.
B. Reports of sexual harassment may be made verbally or in writing. A form for submission of
a written complaint is attached to this Policy, and all employees are encouraged to use this
complaint form. Employees who are reporting sexual harassment on behalf of other
employees should use the complaint form and note that it is on another employee’s behalf.
C. Employees, paid or unpaid interns or non-employees who believe they have been a target of
sexual harassment may also seek assistance in other available forums, as explained below in
the section on Legal Protections.
D. If you feel conduct is of a criminal nature, please notify the Police Department, see section
H. Contact the Local Police Department.
§AR- 74. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CITY.
A. Retaliation
1. Unlawful retaliation can be any action that could discourage a worker from coming
forward to make or support a sexual harassment claim. Adverse action need not be
job-related or occur in the workplace to constitute unlawful retaliation (e.g., threats
of physical violence outside of work hours).
2. Such retaliation is unlawful under federal, state, and (where applicable) local law.
The New York State Human Rights Law protects any individual who has engaged
in “protected activity.” Protected activity occurs when a person has:
a. made a complaint of sexual harassment, either internally or with any antidiscrimination
agency;
b. testified or assisted in a proceeding involving sexual harassment under the
Human Rights Law or other anti-discrimination law;
c. opposed sexual harassment by making a verbal or informal complaint to
management, or by simply informing a supervisor or department head of
harassment;
d. reported that another employee has been sexually harassed; or
e. encouraged a fellow employee to report harassment.
3. Even if the alleged harassment does not turn out to rise to the level of a violation of
law, the individual is protected from retaliation if the person had a good faith belief
that the practices were unlawful. However, the retaliation provision is not intended
to protect persons making intentionally false charges of harassment.
B. Supervisory Responsibilities
1. All supervisors and department heads who receive a complaint or information
about suspected sexual harassment, observe what may be sexually harassing
behavior or for any reason suspect that sexual harassment is occurring, are required
to report such suspected sexual harassment to the Safety Committee Chair and City
Manager.
2. In addition to being subject to discipline if they engaged in sexually harassing
conduct themselves, supervisors and department heads will be subject to discipline
for failing to report suspected sexual harassment or otherwise knowingly allowing
sexual harassment to continue.
3. Supervisors and department heads will also be subject to discipline for engaging in
any retaliation.
C. Complaint and Investigation of Sexual Harassment
1. All complaints or information about sexual harassment will be investigated,
whether that information was reported in verbal or written form. Investigations will
be conducted in a timely manner, and will be confidential to the extent possible.
2. An investigation of any complaint, information or knowledge of suspected sexual
harassment will be prompt and thorough, commenced immediately and completed
as soon as possible. The investigation will be kept confidential to the extent
possible. All persons involved, including complainants, witnesses and alleged
harassers will be accorded due process, as outlined below, to protect their rights to
a fair and impartial investigation.
3. Any employee may be required to cooperate as needed in an investigation of
suspected sexual harassment. The City will not tolerate retaliation against
employees who file complaints, support another’s complaint or participate in an
investigation regarding a violation of this policy.
4. While the process may vary from case to case, investigations should be done in
accordance with the following steps:
a. Upon receipt of complaint, the direct supervisor, department head, Safety
Committee Chair and/or City Manager will conduct an immediate review
of the allegations, and take any interim actions (e.g., instructing the
respondent to refrain from communications with the complainant), as
appropriate. If complaint is verbal, encourage the individual to complete
the “Complaint Form” in writing. If he or she refuses, prepare a
Complaint Form based on the verbal reporting.
b. If documents, emails or phone records are relevant to the investigation,
take steps to obtain and preserve them.
c. Request and review all relevant documents, including all electronic
communications.
d. Interview all parties involved, including any relevant witnesses;
e. Create a written documentation of the investigation (such as a letter,
memo or email), which contains the following:
i. A list of all documents reviewed, along with a detailed summary
of relevant documents;
ii. A list of names of those interviewed, along with a detailed
summary of their statements;
iii. A timeline of events;
iv. A summary of prior relevant incidents, reported or unreported;
and
v. The basis for the decision and final resolution of the complaint,
together with any corrective action(s).
f. Keep the written documentation and associated documents in a secure and
confidential location.
g. Promptly notify the individual who reported and the individual(s) about
whom the complaint was made of the final determination and implement
any corrective actions identified in the written document.
h. Inform the individual who reported of the right to file a complaint or
charge externally as outlined in the next section.
D. Legal Protections And External Remedies
1. Sexual harassment is not only prohibited by the City but is also prohibited by state,
federal, and, where applicable, local law.
2. Aside from the internal process at the City, employees may also choose to pursue
legal remedies with the governmental entities named in the following sections.
While a private attorney is not required to file a complaint with a governmental
agency, you may seek the legal advice of an attorney.
3. In addition to those outlined below, employees in certain industries may have
additional legal protections.
E. State Human Rights Law (HRL)
1. The Human Rights Law (HRL), codified as N.Y. Executive Law, Art. 15, § 290 et
seq., applies to all employers in New York State with regard to sexual harassment,
and protects employees, paid or unpaid interns and non-employees, regardless of
immigration status. A complaint alleging violation of the Human Rights Law may
be filed either with the Division of Human Rights (DHR) or in New York State
Supreme Court.
2. Complaints with DHR may be filed any time within one year of the harassment. If
an individual did not file at DHR, they can sue directly in state court under the
HRL, within three years of the alleged sexual harassment. An individual may not
file with DHR if they have already filed a HRL complaint in state court.
3. Complaining internally to the City does not extend your time to file with DHR or
in court. The one year or three years is counted from date of the most recent
incident of harassment.
4. You do not need an attorney to file a complaint with DHR, and there is no cost to
file with DHR.
5. DHR will investigate your complaint and determine whether there is probable
cause to believe that sexual harassment has occurred. Probable cause cases are
forwarded to a public hearing before an administrative law judge. If sexual
harassment is found after a hearing, DHR has the power to award relief, which
varies but may include requiring your employer to take action to stop the
harassment, or redress the damage caused, including paying of monetary damages,
attorney’s fees and civil fines.
6. DHR’s main office contact information is: NYS Division of Human Rights, One
Fordham Plaza, Fourth Floor, Bronx, New York 10458. You may call (718) 741-
8400 or visit: www.dhr.ny.gov.
7. Contact DHR at (888) 392-3644 or visit dhr.ny.gov/complaint for more
information about filing a complaint. The website has a complaint form that can be
downloaded, filled out, notarized and mailed to DHR. The website also contains
contact information for DHR’s regional offices across New York State.
F. Civil Rights Act of 1964
1. The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces
federal anti-discrimination laws, including Title VII of the 1964 federal Civil
Rights Act (codified as 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.). An individual can file a
complaint with the EEOC anytime within 300 days from the harassment. There is
no cost to file a complaint with the EEOC. The EEOC will investigate the
complaint, and determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that
discrimination has occurred, at which point the EEOC will issue a Right to Sue
letter permitting the individual to file a complaint in federal court.
2. The EEOC does not hold hearings or award relief, but may take other action
including pursuing cases in federal court on behalf of complaining parties. Federal
courts may award remedies if discrimination is found to have occurred. In general,
private employers must have at least 15 employees to come within the jurisdiction
of the EEOC.
3. An employee alleging discrimination at work can file a “Charge of
Discrimination.” The EEOC has district, area, and field offices where complaints
can be filed. Contact the EEOC by calling 1-800-669-4000 (TTY: 1-800-669-
6820), visiting their website at www.eeoc.gov or via email at info@eeoc.gov.
4. If an individual filed an administrative complaint with DHR, DHR will file the
complaint with the EEOC to preserve the right to proceed in federal court.
G. Local Protections
1. Many localities enforce laws protecting individuals from sexual harassment and
discrimination. An individual should contact the county, city or town in which
they live to find out if such a law exists. For example, employees who work in
New York City may file complaints of sexual harassment with the New York City
Commission on Human Rights. Contact their main office at Law Enforcement
Bureau of the NYC Commission on Human Rights, 40 Rector Street, 10th Floor,
New York, New York; call 311 or (212) 306-7450; or visit
www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/html/home/home.shtml.
H. Contact the Local Police Department
1. If the harassment involves unwanted physical touching, coerced physical
confinement or coerced sex acts, the conduct may constitute a crime. Contact the
local police department at (315) 393-1555.
§ AR-73. Responsibilities of City employees.
All City employees are responsible to help assure that we avoid harassment. If you feel that you
have experienced or witnessed harassment, you are to notify your supervisor immediately.
If you feel uncomfortable reporting to your supervisor, you should report to the City Manager or
the City Attorney.
§ AR-74. Responsibilities of the City.
The City forbids retaliation against anyone for reporting sexual harassment, assisting in making a
sexual harassment complaint or cooperating in a sexual harassment investigation. The City's
policy is to investigate all such complaints thoroughly and promptly. To the fullest extent
practicable, the City will keep complaints and terms of their resolution confidential. If an
investigation confirms that harassment has occurred, the City will take corrective action,
including any discipline that is appropriate up to and including immediate termination of
employment.

A. Purpose and Goals
E-mail is one of the City of Ogdensburg’s core internal and external communication
methods. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that e-mail systems used by City staff
support City business functions to their fullest capacity. This policy advises staff and
management of their responsibilities and provides guidance in managing information
communicated by e-mail. All City e-mail is the property of the City of Ogdensburg.

E-Mail services are provided to staff whose job functions require it and as resources
allow. Access requests must be made by Department Heads for each employee to the
Email Administrator. The Department Head must notify the Email Administrator
immediately when an e-mail user separates employment (retirement, resignation, etc.)
with the City. The Email Administrator will be responsible for removing user
credentials immediately.
C. Use of E-Mail
E-mail services, like other means of communication, are to be used to support City
business. Staff may use e-mail to communicate informally with others in the City so

to communicate outside of the City when such communications are related to
legitimate business activities and are within their job assignments or responsibilities.
Staff will not use e-mail for illegal, disruptive, unethical or unprofessional activities,
or for personal matters or for any purpose that would jeopardize the legitimate
interests of the City.
D. Privacy and Access
E-mail messages are not personal or private. E-mail system administrators will not
routinely monitor individual staff member's e-mail and will take reasonable
precautions to protect the privacy of e-mail. However, management and City network
administrators may access an employee's e-mail:
(1) for a legitimate business purpose (e.g., the need to access information when
an employee is absent for an extended period of time);
(2) to diagnose and resolve technical problems involving system hardware,
software, or communications;

retained for extended periods of time. Users should remove all e-mail
communications in a timely fashion. If a user needs to retain
information in an e-mail message for an extended period, he or she
should transfer it from the e-mail system to an appropriate electronic
or other filing system (e.g. Microsoft Outlook).
(2) Applicable to records communicated via e-mail

(1) Records communicated using e-mail need to be identified, managed,
protected and retained as long as they are needed to meet operational, legal,
audit, research or other requirements. Records needed to support program
functions should be retained, managed and accessible in an existing filing
system outside the e-mail system in accordance with the appropriate
program unit's standard practices.
(2) Records communicated via e-mail will be disposed of within the record
keeping system in which they have been filed in accordance with a Records
Disposition Authorization (RDA) approved by State Archives and Records
Administration (SARA). Management should consult with the City Records
AR:76
Management Officer concerning RDAs applicable to their program's
records.

• dispose of copies of records in e-mail after they have been filed in a
record keeping system; and,

Management will develop and/or publicize record keeping practices in their
area of responsibility including the routing, format and filing of records
communicated via e-mail. They will train staff in appropriate use and be
responsible for ensuring the security of physical devices, passwords and

employees and persons legitimately affiliated with the City of Ogdensburg
for the efficient exchange of information and the completion of assigned

2. Using anti-virus software to scan for viruses on all files that
are downloaded from the Internet or any other outside source.

free applications come with spyware and other malware
including viruses.

with State laws.

GENERAL REFERENCES
Code of Ethics -- See Ch. 27.
§ 17-1. Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide legal and financial protection for those individuals
serving the City of Ogdensburg, from suits which may be brought against them in their
individual capacity for acts taken while in the performance of their official duties and
responsibilities. In enacting this chapter, the City Council finds that the State of New York has
enacted similar provisions for the legal and financial security of its officers and employees and
further finds that such security is also required for local personnel. By enactment of this chapter,
the City Council does not intend to limit or otherwise abrogate any existing right or
responsibility of the City or its employees with regard to indemnification or legal defense. It is
solely the intent of this chapter to provide similar coverage for local employees as is presently
provided for state employees, so as to continue to attract qualified individuals to local
government service.

As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms shall have the

complaint to have occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his public
employment or duties or which is brought to enforce a provision of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 or

is brought by or on behalf of the City of Ogdensburg.
B. Subject to the conditions set forth in Subsection A of this section, the employee shall be
entitled to be represented by the City Attorney; provided, however, that the employee shall
be entitled to representation by private counsel of his choice in any civil judicial proceeding
whenever the City Attorney determines, based upon his investigation and review of the facts
and circumstances of the case, that representation by the City Attorney would be
inappropriate, or whenever a court of competent jurisdiction upon appropriate motion or by a
special proceeding, determines that a conflict of interest exists and that the employee is
entitled to be represented by private counsel of his choice. The City Attorney shall notify the
employee in writing of such determination that the employee is entitled to be represented by
private counsel of his choice. The City Attorney may require, as a condition to payment of
the fees and expenses of such representation, that appropriate groups of such employees be
represented by the same counsel. If the employee or group of employees is entitled to
representation by private counsel under the provisions of this section, the City Attorney shall
so certify to the City Council. Reasonable attorneys' fees and litigation expenses shall be paid
by the City to such private counsel from time to time during the pendency of the civil action

section on behalf of the employee to avoid entry of a default judgment pending resolution of
any question pertaining to the obligation to provide for a defense.
§ 17-4. Indemnification of City employees; exceptions.
A. The City shall indemnify and save harmless its employees in the amount of any judgment
obtained against such employees in any state or federal court, or in the amount of any
settlement of a claim, provided that the act or omission from which such judgment or
settlement arose occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his public
employment or duties; the duty to indemnify and save harmless prescribed by this section
shall not arise where the injury or damage resulted from intentional wrongdoing or
recklessness on the part of the employee.

submit such settlement and certification to the City Attorney. The Attorney shall review such
proposed settlement as to form and amount, and shall give his approval if in his judgment the

authorize the City to indemnify or save harmless an employee with respect to a settlement
not so reviewed and approved by the City Attorney.

employee shall cause to be served a copy of such judgment or settlement, personally or by
certified or registered mail, within thirty (30) days of the date of entry or settlement, upon the

original or a copy of any summons, complaint, process, notice, demand or pleading within five
(5) days after he is served with such document; and the full cooperation of the employee in the
defense of such action or proceeding and in defense of any action or proceeding against the City
based upon the same act or omission, and in the prosecution of any appeal. Such delivery shall
be deemed a request by the employee that the City provide for his defense pursuant to this
chapter.
§ 17-6. Applicability limited.

§ 66-1. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
ALARM SYSTEM -- A device or an assembly of equipment which emits an audible
response which is intended to alert persons outside the premises to the existence of a hazard
or emergency or which is intended to alert emergency agencies by automatically dialing an
emergency agency or which is connected to a private answering point for the purposes of
reporting such alarms to the emergency agencies or which is directly connected to the
emergency communications center or other emergency agency.
ALARM USER -- Any person who owns, leases or uses an alarm system in the City of
Ogdensburg, except for a person whose alarm is on a mobile vehicle or is a proprietary
system.
AVOIDABLE ALARM -- The activation of an alarm system through mechanical failure,
malfunction, improper installation or the negligence of the owner, user, custodian or lessee of
an alarm system or of his employees or agency or through any other cause which, through
direct connection through an emergency agency, or which, through notification of any
emergency via a private answering point or an automatic dialing service, or which, through
notification to an emergency agency by any other second party or means, indicates that
emergency situations exist requiring an emergency response within the City of Ogdensburg
when, in fact, an emergency situation does not exist. An "avoidable alarm" also includes the
knowing or intentional activation of an alarm to an emergency agency and the activator
knows that an emergency situation does not exist. "Avoidable alarm" does not include alarms
activated by violent conditions of nature, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes or any
Chapter 66
ALARM SYSTEMS
66:2
OGDENSBURG CODE
other similar cause beyond the control of the user of an alarm system. Activation of alarm
systems under any circumstances in which the activator reasonably believes that emergency
situations exist is not an "avoidable alarm."
EMERGENCY AGENCY -- The Police Department or Fire Department, when summoned to
respond to an emergency situation by the fire/police dispatch center.
LOCAL ALARM SYSTEM -- A signaling system which, when activated, causes an audible
signaling device to be activated outside the premises within which the system is installed.
PRIVATE ANSWERING POINT -- A business which offers the services of receiving
emergency signals, monitoring said signals and relaying them to an emergency agency.
PROPRIETARY SYSTEM -- An alarm, sounding and/or recording alarm and supervisory
signals at a control center located within the premises protected by the alarm which is not
intended to alert persons outside the premises on which the alarm system is located of a
possible hazard and not intended to alert an emergency agency, the control center being
under the supervision of the proprietor of the protected premises. If a "proprietary system"
includes a signal line connected directly to or by means of an automatic dialing device to an
emergency or to a private answering point or to a local alarm system, it thereby becomes an
alarm system as defined in this section.
§ 66-2. Proprietary alarm systems; new systems.
The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to proprietary alarm systems. Additionally, a thirtyday
grace period will be allowed for new alarm systems.
§ 66-3. Avoidable alarms; excessive use fees.
A. The City shall notify an alarm user, in writing, by means of first class mail sent to the home
address listed at the dispatch center of all avoidable alarms during the calendar year. Such
notice shall inform the alarm user that if the alarm user has three (3) avoidable alarms within
a calendar year, then he will be subject to an excessive use fee. The excess use fee shall be as
follows:
Number of Excessive
Avoidable Alarms Use Fee
4 or 5 $ 50.00
6 or 7 100.00
8 or more 250.00
B. The City shall notify each alarm user, in writing, by means of first class mail of each
avoidable alarm incurred and the amount to be charged. Should the City not receive prompt
payment within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice, the City reserves the right to
disconnect the user from the emergency control center panels for excessive abuse.
66:3
ALARM SYSTEMS
§ 66-4. Classification of alarms; review.
The Chief of Police and the Fire Chief shall establish policy and procedures whereby an alarm
user who has been notified of an avoidable alarm may present evidence as to why any such alarm
should not be classified as an avoidable alarm. The Chief of Police and the Fire Chief shall
designate members of their Departments to collect such evidence and make a recommendation
and findings of fact concerning such classification. The Chief of Police or Fire Chief shall make
the final determination concerning a classification, which determination shall be reviewable only
pursuant to procedures established under Article 78 of the Civil Service Practice Law and Rules.
In order to challenge the classification of an alarm as an avoidable alarm, an alarm user must
notify the Chief of Police, in writing, within twenty (20) days after the notification to the alarm
user of the avoidable alarm. The failure to give timely notice shall be deemed a waiver of the
right to challenge the classification.
§ 66-5. Disconnection.
The decision to disconnect users from the fire control center shall be at the sole and absolute
discretion of the Fire Chief of the Fire Department. The decision to disconnect users from the
intrusion alarm system shall be at the sole and absolute discretion of the Police Chief of the
Police Department.
§ 66-6. Rules and regulations.
The Chief of Police and Fire Chief shall have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations
concerning alarm systems. The Ogdensburg Police and Fire Departments will monitor both
telephone and direct alarms, as long as the owner's alarm is compatible with the present
equipment and resources.

ARTICLE II
Game Rooms
[Adopted 5-14-1984 by Ord. No. 4-1984
(Ch. 19, Art. IV, of the 1975 Ogdensburg Municipal Code)]
§ 71-11. Title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Licensing of Coin-Operated Amusement
Devices Law of the City of Ogdensburg, New York."
§ 71-12. Policy; findings.
A. It is hereby declared as the policy of the City of Ogdensburg that it is necessary to regulate
and control the operation of coin-operated amusement devices for the purpose of fostering
and promoting the public order, including but not limited to the public interests hereinafter
set forth.
B. The City Council has been made aware of crowd congestion in and near establishments
which have as their principal source of business the playing of coin-operated amusement
devices, including electronic and computerized game machines, and the City Council hereby
determines that such crowded conditions tend to threaten the orderly conduct of business in
such establishments as well as in other nearby businesses. Such crowded and noisy
conditions also disturb persons passing by on the sidewalks, as well as adjacent and nearby
residences.
C. Further, the City Council determines that, because of the number of persons who frequent
establishments which have as their principal source of business the playing of such
amusement devices, it is in the interest of the public good to determine whether premises
containing game rooms comply with all fire, health, sanitary and building codes and other
applicable state and local laws and to adopt rules and regulations governing the occupancy
and use of such game rooms. The City Council further determines that a particularly large
segment of those playing the machines are teenagers, some of whom patronize such
establishments during school hours rather than attend required school classes and thereby
undermine their health and welfare as well as place an unnecessary financial and social cost
on the taxpayers of the City of Ogdensburg.
D. The City Council thus declares that the above-stated policy will best be carried out by
establishing the licensing procedure set forth in this article and that such licensing procedure
is necessary and will enhance the public's health, safety and order by reasonably providing
safeguards for the community in the conduct of such businesses. It is further determined that
the hereinafter imposed license fee is reasonably related to the City's cost of implementing
and enforcing the license requirements. The City Council determines that the concerns set
forth above are increased as the number of devices in a location is increased. The City
Council further determines that the concerns addressed by this legislation are likely to be
magnified and increased as the number of amusement devices is increased in a particular
location.

§ 87-1. Title.
The title of this chapter shall be the "Child Protection Act."
§ 87-2. Legislative findings and intent.
A. It is the intent of this chapter to serve the City's compelling interest to promote, protect and
improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City by creating areas around
locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain
sexual offenders are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence.
B. The City Council of the City of Ogdensburg finds that one of the highest priorities of local
government is the protection of the health and safety of its citizens. This is especially true for
children and other vulnerable members of society. The City Council further finds that Level
3 convicted sex offenders pose a significant continuing risk to society.
C. The City Council finds that the protection of the victims and potential victims of sexual
offenders in Ogdensburg is a matter of unique local concern not fully and adequately
addressed by state law. The City Council finds that the disclosures required and the
limitations contained herein will protect the citizens of Ogdensburg and in protecting
children who may come into proximity with a sex offender in the scope of employment with
the City.
D. The City Council finds that the City of Ogdensburg agrees with the New York State Division
of Criminal Justice Services risk assessment of sex offenders and has made no determination
that conflicts with restrictions placed on any particular sex offender or level of sex offenders.
Rather, the Council finds that this chapter is remedial in nature and designed to fill certain
gaps in state law as well as to provide protections for residents of the City who receive
certain services from the City. The Council further finds this chapter to be the most narrowly
Chapter 87

available to address any event described in Subsection A of this section, and the authority to
issue a stop-work order shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for or limitation of, the

D. In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect
of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain
management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles;
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with conducting search and
rescue operations during period of flooding;
(11) The expected heights velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the
floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions,
including search and rescue operations, maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D and the purposes of this chapter, the
Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including technical
information, and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
§ 105-17. Variances.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots
with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that §§ 105-16D(1)
through (12) has been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2)
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration or structures and
contributing structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State
Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the contributing structures procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements
and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use,
provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D and F of this section are met.
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood
damages during the base flood and create no additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to
the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense or create nuisances,
cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
G. Any applicant who is granted a variance for a building with the lowest floor below the base
flood elevation shall be given written notice that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from lowest floor elevation.

[Adopted 11-26-1979 as L.L. No. 6-1979
(Ch. 146 of the 1975 Ogdensburg Municipal Code)]
ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 177-1. Legislative authority; rents established.
Pursuant to the authority granted by Article 14-F of the General Municipal Law of the State of
New York, the City Council of the City of Ogdensburg does hereby establish a scale of rents to
be called "sewer rents" which are hereby levied and assessed against every lot, parcel of land,
building or premises now or hereafter having any connection with the sewer system of said City
or otherwise discharging domestic sewage, commercial and industrial waste, water or other
liquids either directly or indirectly into the sanitary sewer system of the City, the revenue from
which shall be used for the payment of the cost of operations, maintenance and repairs of the
sewer system or such part or parts thereof for which sewer rents have been and are hereby
established and imposed, the interest on and amortization of, payment of, indebtedness which has
been or shall be incurred for the construction and repair of the sewer system or such parts or part
thereof for which sewer rents have been and are established or imposed (other than indebtedness,
and the interest thereon, which is to be paid in the first instance from assessments upon benefited
real property) and for the construction of sewage treatment and disposal works with necessary
appurtenances, including pumping stations, or for the extension, enlargement or replacement of
or additions to such sewer systems or a part or parts thereof.
§ 177-2. Determination of sewer rents.
A. City resident users. In addition to any and all fees and charges provided by law, the owner of
any parcel of real property within the City limits connected with the sewer system of the City
of Ogdensburg shall pay a sewer rent for the use of such sewer system based upon
consumption of water, both metered or flat rate, to said premises in an amount to be fixed
and determined as hereinafter provided.
B. Nonresident users. In order that property lying outside the corporate limits of the City of
Ogdensburg being served by its sewage disposal system shall bear proportionate share of the
cost of such system, the charge made for such property shall be determined by the City
Council as hereinafter provided and as authorized by § 451, Subdivision 1, of the General
Municipal Law, such charge to be collected and the collection enforced as herein provided
for other rental charges.
177: 4
OGDENSBURG CODE
C. User whose water source is not from City water system. For the purpose of determining the
amount to be charged, premises using the sewer system whereon the water used is derived in
whole or in part from sources independent of the City water system such water shall be
measured by a City water meter or by a meter acceptable to the City Engineer, to be installed
and maintained by the owner or occupant thereof, at his own cost, and subject to the
supervision, control and inspection by said City Engineer. The sewer rent charged against
such property shall be determined by the metered consumption of water used on said
premises regardless of the source from which supplied according to the schedule herein and
hereinafter adopted by the City Council. Whenever the owner or occupant fails to install such
meter or when the City Council finds it impractical to insist upon such meter, the City
Council may accept the report of said property owner as to the amount of water used on said
premises or the City Council may fix and determine the amount ordinarily consumed upon
said premises by such method as it may find practicable in the light of the conditions and
attendant circumstances of the case, in order to determine the sewer rental charge, all in
accordance with corresponding rates assessed against other similar property.
§ 177-3. Rules and regulations.
The City Council shall have power to make and enforce such general rules and regulations, both
as to public and private water supply, for the collection, rebating and refunding or adjustment of
such charges for any reason, including diversion of water from the sewer system as may be
reasonably necessary to avoid injustice, to the end that all property discharging sewage in the
sewer system will bear its equitable proportionate share with other property of the cost of
construction, operation, maintenance and repairs of said sewer system or any extension,
enlargement, replacement or additions to such sewer system or any part or parts thereof.
§ 177-4. Deposit and use of funds.
All revenues derived from the sewer rents imposed hereunder, together with all penalties and
interest thereon, shall be kept by the City Comptroller in a separate account to be known as the
"Sewer Rent Fund" to be deposited and used as provided by § 453 of the General Municipal
Law.
§ 177-5. Rates for metered premises. [Last amended 11-13-2017 by L.L. No. 5-2017]
The following rates for sewer rents are hereby fixed and established to every lot, parcel of land,

§ 177-6. Flat rates within corporation limits. [Last amended 11-13-2017 by L.L. No. 5-2017]
The following schedule of rates for sewer rents is hereby fixed and established for every lot,
parcel of land, building or premises now or hereafter being charged at a flat rate for sewer
service within the City of Ogdensburg, New York, effective the first billing date after January 1,
2018:
A. Single-family residence, per year: $405.
B. Multifamily residence for each family unit or each tenant, per year: $405.
C. Combination residential/commercial for each individual unit, per year: $405.
D. Apartment houses, for each individual unit: $405.
E. Rooming houses (private homes with additional rooms to rent or commercial rooming
houses):
(1) Minimum annual rent: $405.
(2) Additional rooms to hire (annual rent): $101.25.
§ 177-7. Rates for nonresident users.
The sewer rent rate for any lot, parcel of land, building or other premises located outside the
corporate limits of the City of Ogdensburg and serviced by the wastewater collection and
treatment facilities of the City of Ogdensburg shall be the same rate as that charged for the
equivalent type of structure within the corporate limits of the City.
§ 177-8. Surcharge for high-strength wastes.
A. Any user of the City wastewater treatment facilities who contributes high-strength
wastewater shall pay a surcharge, the measure of which is normally the concentration of
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS) above a certain limit. A
regular sampling and analysis program will be instituted on the wastewater from those users
with suspected high-strength wastes in order to obtain data to determine the magnitude of the
surcharge (if any).
177: 6
OGDENSBURG CODE
B. Table A shows the system whereby the surcharge is calculated when concentrations above
300 parts per million BOD and 350 parts per million SS are found from sampling and
analysis. The sampling and analysis program, including the calculations, will be geared to a
quarterly surcharge rather than monthly, although sampling once each week provides more
consistent and reliable data.

increase in charge.]
§ 177-9. Billing; payment; penalties.
A. Metered premises. Where water is supplied by the City on a metered rate, meters shall be
read periodically (not less frequently than quarterly) and the charges shall be payable upon
rendering of bills to the owners of the City Comptroller.
B. Unmetered premises. Where water is supplied by the City on a flat rate, the sewer rent
established by this Part 1 shall become due and payable on the fifth day of February and
August of each year. [Amended 5-10-1982 by L.L. No. 2-1982]
C. Payment period; penalties; enforcement. Each such installment shall be paid to the City
Comptroller within a period of 30 days after it is due and payable. If said sewer rent is not
paid within said 30 days, a penalty of 10% for nonpayment of said sewer rents shall be
assessed and collected. It is hereby made the duty of the City Comptroller to collect such
penalties for failure to pay the sewer rental charge when due.
177: 7
SEWERS
(1) Where water is not supplied by the City, the sewer rent established by this Part 1 shall be
payable upon rendering of bills to the owners by the City Comptroller. If such charge is
not paid when due it shall be subject to the same penalty as above and the City
Comptroller is hereby required to collect such penalty. In the event that any bill for
sewer rent for premises where water is not supplied by the City of Ogdensburg is not
paid within 30 days after rendering thereof, said City Comptroller shall certify the same,
together with such penalty, and the same shall be collected and the collection thereof
enforced in the same manner in all respects as City, county and state taxes and they shall
be added to said taxes subject to like penalty, costs and interest charges.
(2) All sewer rents for premises using City water shall be payable, collectible and
enforceable in the manner provided by law for the collection of City taxes and when
remaining unpaid shall be added to the annual City taxes or state and county tax on the
property to and for which sewer service was furnished and rendered.
§ 177-10. Refunds.
The claims for refunds of flat-rate sewer rents on whatever basis shall first be approved by the
City Comptroller. Claims for refunds shall not be allowed for a longer period than one year from
the date such claims are filed and, in no event, shall claims for refunds for less than 1/4 of a year
be allowable.
§ 177-11. Industrial cost recovery system.
A. Under the ICR system, industrial users of the wastewater collection and treatment facilities
will be charged for the portion of the federal grant amount applicable to the treatment of their
wastes. An "industrial user" is defined as a nongovernmental nonresidential user discharging
more than the equivalent of 25,000 gallons per day (gpd) of sanitary wastes and identified in
the Standard Industrial Classification Manual 1972, under Division A, B, G, E or I. In
determining the amount of discharge for ICR purposes, the City, at its option, may include or
exclude the strictly domestic-type discharge from such users. If the domestic type discharge
is excluded and the remaining amount of discharge is greater than the equivalent of 25,000
gpd of sanitary wastes, the user is then considered to be an industrial user. Also, any user
discharging toxic materials into the sewers in sufficient quantities to affect the treatment of
the waste stream or the ultimate processing and disposal of sludge is considered to be an
industrial user. Regulations outlining the ICR system requirements, including the preceding
definitions, appear in United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulations
as published in the Federal Register of September 27, 1978.
B. Under the present USEPA system, users who are classified as industrial users are required to
repay their share of the federal grant amount in addition to any user charges. The federal
grant is normally 75% of the total, eligible capital cost of the project. (Costs related to the
detection, rehabilitation and treatment of excessive infiltration/inflow to the sewer system are
not included.)
177: 8
OGDENSBURG CODE
C. Industrial users will be charged based on their relative waste contributions to the plant. The
following format shall be used to calculate the ICR charges:
Fa x Gf + BODa x Gb + SSa x Gs
Fc BODC SSc
IC =
30
Where:
IC = Annual charge to a specific industrial user for industrial cost recovery
(dollars).
Fa = Average daily flow from an industrial user throughout the year (gallons per
day) (determined by metering flow to the municipal sewers).
Fc = Average daily flow capacity at treatment plant (gallons).
Gf = Portion of total federal grant amount allocated to flow (dollars).
BODa = Average daily biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) input from the industrial
user's waste throughout the year (pounds per day) (determined by regular
sampling and analysis of industrial discharge).
BODc = Average daily biochemical oxygen demand capacity at treatment plant
(pounds per day).
Gb = Portion of total federal grant amount allocated to BOD (dollars).
SSa = Average daily suspended solids input from the industrial user throughout
the year (pounds per day) (determined by regular sampling and analysis of
industrial discharge).
SSc = Average daily suspended solids capacity of the treatment plant (pounds per
day).
Gs = Portion of total federal grant amount allocated to suspended solids (dollars).
NOTE: Total federal grant amount = Gf = Gb = + Gs
D. Any industry which contributes the following approximate amounts would be subject to ICR:
(1) ICR (flow): 25,000 gpd or greater.
(2) ICR (BOD): 43,000 pounds per day or greater.
(3) ICR (SS): 50 pounds per day or greater.
177: 9
SEWERS
E. The City may exclude inputs from strictly sanitary conveniences located within the industry,
using the following amounts:
(1) Sanitary flow = (number of workers) x 40 gallons per day per worker.
(2) Sanitary BOD = (number of workers) x 0.8 pounds per day per worker.
(3) Sanitary SS = (number of workers) x 0.94 pounds per day per worker.
F. Calculated sanitary parameter levels are subtracted from measured total industrial (sanitary
and process) levels to obtain ICR parameter levels. If any of the three ICR parameter levels
are higher than the minimum ICR parameter levels listed above, the user is considered to be
an industrial user and is subject to ICR charges.
G. Moneys collected by the City under the ICR program must be allocated in the following
manner:
(1) Fifty percent of the ICR moneys collected and all accrued interest may be returned to the
Federal Treasury by way of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
(2) Forty percent of the ICR moneys collected must be retained by the City to be used for
upgrading or expanding the sewerage works to meet applicable pollution discharge
requirements in the future.
(3) The remaining 10% may be used in any manner the City sees fit, provided that it is not
used for rebates to industries or the construction of pretreatment works.
H. Industrial cost recovery charges are hereby suspended until their imposition is mandated by
the federal government.

the discharge and corrective action taken to prevent future discharges shall be filed by
the responsible industrial facility within five days of the occurrence of the noncomplying
discharge.
B. This notification will not relieve users of liability for any expense, loss or damage to
the sewer system, treatment plant, treatment process or any other damage to person or
property, nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may be imposed by this article or on the municipality under applicable state
and federal regulations.
(1) Excessive discharge. No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any
way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment in order to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the Federal
Categorical Pretreatment Standards, as amended, or in any other pollutant-specified
limitation developed by the state or City.
(2) Accidental and Slug discharges. Each user shall provide protection from accidental
and slug discharge of prohibited materials or of exceeding the limitations of other
substances regulated by this Part 2. If deemed necessary by the City Engineer,
177: 25
SEWERS
facilities to prevent accidental and slug discharge shall be provided and maintained at
the owner's expense. Detailed plans, showing facilities and operation procedures
to provide this protection, shall be submitted to the City Engineer for review and
shall be approved by the City Engineer prior to construction of the facility. Review
and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial or
commercial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to
meet the other requirements of this Part 2. At the request of the City, the user shall
develop a slug control plan which includes a description of the discharge practices
including non-routine batch discharges; a description of the stored chemicals;
procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges and if necessary
procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills. The slug control plan
shall be updated by the User as changes are made to the facility.
(3) The industrial user shall develop a compliance schedule including milestone dates for
the installation of technology required to meet a pretreatment standard, as necessary.
The POTW shall develop compliance schedules and report requirements to the POTW.
The industrial users shall be required to comply with the compliance schedule and any
succeeding revisions to that schedule.
C. UpsetProvision
(1) Definition. For the purposes of this section, Upset means an exceptional incident in
which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
Industrial User. An Upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment
facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(2) Effect of an upset. An Upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements of
paragraph (3) are met.
(3) Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. An Industrial User who wishes to
establish the affirmative defense of Upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(a) An Upset occurred and the Industrial User can identify the cause(s) of the Upset;
(b) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner
and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures;
(c) The Industrial User has submitted the following information to the POTW and
Control Authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the Upset (if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five
days):
(i) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
(ii) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not
corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue;
(iii) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of
the noncompliance.
(4) Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the Industrial User seeking to establish
the occurrence of an Upset shall have the burden of proof.
177: 26
OGDENSBURG CODE
(5) Reviewability of agency consideration of claims of upset. In the usual exercise of
prosecutorial discretion, EPA enforcement personnel should review any claims that
non-compliance was caused by an Upset. No determinations made in the course of the

the accurate observation, sampling and measurement of wastes. Such equipment shall be
maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all times.
D. The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the industrial user's premises
outside of the building. When such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship
on the user, the City Engineer may allow such facility to be constructed in the public street or
sidewalk area, with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction over such street or
sidewalk, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or
parked vehicles.
E. When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the City Engineer may require
installation of separate monitoring equipment for each user. When there is a significant
difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different operations of
a single user, the City Engineer may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed
for each separate discharge.
F. Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be
constructed in accordance with the City's requirements and all applicable construction
standards and specifications.
§ 177-63. Inspections; sampling; analysis.
A. Compliance determination. Compliance determinations with respect to Article IX
prohibitions and limitations may be made on the basis of either instantaneous grab samples or
composite samples of wastewater. Composite samples may be taken over a twenty-four-hour
period or over a longer or shorter time span, as determined necessary by the City Engineer, to
meet the needs of specific circumstances.
177: 39
SEWERS
B. Analysis of industrial wastewaters. All wastewater sampling and analysis for the local
pretreatment program must be conducted using methods and procedures in 40 CFR Part 136.
Analysis of those pollutants not covered by 40CFR Part 136 Laboratory analysis of industrial
wastewater samples shall be performed in accordance with the current edition of Standard
Methods or Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Waste, published by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency.
C. Sampling frequency. Sampling of industrial wastewater for the purpose of compliance
determination with respect to Article IX prohibitions and limitations will be done at such
intervals as the City Engineer may designate. However, it is the intention of the City
Engineer to conduct compliance sampling or to cause such sampling to be conducted for all
major contributing industries at least once in every one-year period. The City Engineer shall
have the power to take samples and make tests necessary to determine the nature and
concentration of such wastes, and shall have the right to reassess his determination by taking
samples and tests at any time or by periodic rechecks without notice to the person
discharging such wastes:
(1) Samples shall be taken and flow measurements made at the control manhole or
manholes which are specifically identified with the user unit.
(2) In the event that a control manhole or manholes have not been required, the samples
shall be taken at a suitable and accessible point or points to be selected by the City
Engineer and are specifically identified with the user unit.
(3) An aliquot portion of the sample(s) taken will be made available to the person whose
premises are being tested if he so requests.
§ 177-64. Determination of pollutant concentrations.
A. The pollutant concentration of any sewage, industrial waste or other wastes shall usually be
determined from representative samples of the effluent discharged to public sewers, taken by
the City Engineer at sampling stations, at any period or time and of such duration and in such
manner as the City Engineer may elect or at any place or manner mutually agreed upon
between the user and City Engineer. The intent of any sampling procedure is to establish the
pollutant concentration in the sewage discharged during an average or typical working day.
This concentration may be derived according to the best judgment of the City Engineer, by
combination of repeated sub-samplings during any one day, by combination of a series of
such days or by combination of a number of multiple samples. The analysis of samples taken
shall be performed in a laboratory designated by the City Engineer and the surcharge and/or
the acceptability of the wastes shall be determined from said analyses.
B. All charges shall be based on the analysis of the wastes from any plant or premises related to
total volume of wastes. The concentration of pollutants in sewage, industrial waste or other
waste shall be used in calculating the sewer surcharge in accordance with the billing
procedure of the City for the collection of charges and shall remain in effect until the person
shall prove or the City shall determine that a change in the manufacturing process,
production or waste treatment of said company warrants a reanalysis for the determination of
a new pollutant concentration of its wastes discharged from such premises into the public
sewer system. The new pollutant concentration shall then be used in calculating new charges
and shall become effective as of the date of the subsequent billing period.
177: 40
OGDENSBURG CODE
C. Whenever the wastes discharged from a premises to the public sewer might to be expected to
show appreciable periodic variations during the year due to manufacturing process or
production variation due to seasonal changes, the City Engineer may average the results of
two or more series of analyses taken to reflect these variations and thereby determine an
average pollutant concentration.
§ 177-65. Determination of volume.
The City Engineer may use, as the figure representing the number of cubic feet and/or gallons of
sewage discharged into the sewer system the amount of water supplied to the premises by the
City or if such premises are used for an industrial or commercial purpose of such nature that the
water supplied to the premises cannot be entirely discharged into the sewer system made by the
City Engineer or the number of cubic feet of sewage discharged into the sewer system as
determined by measurements and samples taken at a manhole installed by the owner of the
property served by the public sewer system, at his own expense, in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the permit issued by the City Engineer pursuant to § 177-11 of these rules and
regulations.
§ 177-66. Disputed pollutant concentrations; resampling.
In the event that the pollutant concentration of the waste discharged from a premise to a public
sewer is disputed by a person, a program of resampling and gauging with subsequent chemical
determination may be instituted as follows:
A. The person must submit a request for resampling and gauging of the wastes to the City
Engineer and bind himself to bear all of the expenses incurred by the City in the resampling
and gauging and subsequent analysis of the wastes.
B. A consultant or agency of recognized professional standing in the employment of the person
must confer with representatives of the City in order that an agreement may be reached as to
the various factors which must be considered in a new sampling program.
C. The consultant or agency of recognized professional standing employed by the person must
be present or represented during the resampling operation.
D. Resampling must be performed when all waste producing processes are contributing wastes
of normal concentrations at their normal rate.
E. The results of the resampling and the reanalysis in a laboratory designated by the City
Engineer shall be considered to be the current analysis of the wastes discharged to the public
sewer system and shall be used for determining the surcharge and/or acceptability of the
wastes.

permits. It is prohibited to place yard waste in the street. Collection will start no later than
May 1 of each year and will run through the week leading up to Memorial Day. The last day to
place material out for pick up is the second to last Sunday in May (i.e. if Memorial Day is May
28th, then the last day to put material out for pick up is May 20th). There will be no penalties for
putting out yard waste early during this cleanup cycle.
The fall cleanup will start during the last full week of October, but no later than November 1st.
As with the spring cleanup, yard waste may be placed between the edge of the street and the
sidewalk or along the edge of the street if no sidewalk exists on the home owners’ property. It
is prohibited to place yard waste in the street. DPW will continue the fall collection process
until late November or until weather no longer permits. The last day to place material out for
pick up is the Sunday before Thanksgiving.
Storm related debris will be picked up by the City’s DPW on an on-call basis. City residents
can contact DPW during regular business hours to schedule a pickup.
Free, year-around drop off of yard waste is available to all City residents at the City’s land
clearing debris landfill located on outer Champlain Street on scheduled drop-off days.
B. "Yard waste" shall be defined as:
(1) Leaves
(2) Brush
(3) Small branches, sticks and twigs cut to manageable sizes.
(4) Tree limbs and small trees less than six (6) inches in diameter. They must be cut into

Note: Larger trees and limbs taken down by the home owner or a contractor may be dropped
off at no charge at the City’s land clearing debris landfill located on outer Champlain Street on
scheduled drop-off days or on an on-call basis. The City will not pick up trees taken down by a
contractor.
C. One Time Summer Pickup
1) In addition to the Spring and Fall pickups, the City will conduct one summer pickup just
before the Annual Seaway Festival (last full week in July).
2) Property owners can place their yard waste out for pick up two weeks before the festival,
but no later than the Sunday prior to the commencement of the festival. DPW will conduct
City wide pick-up Monday – Friday before the festival (see example below).
Seaway Festival – Saturday – July 21st to Sunday – July 29th
Material can start to be placed out for pickup on Sunday – July 8th
Last day to put out material, Sunday – July 15th

[Amended 12-12-2016 by Ord.No.21-2016]
A. No person shall construct, improve, renew or replace any sidewalk unless the grade and width
thereof be fixed and material and the manner of construction be prescribed by the Director of

B. When the City Council deems that it is in the interest of the general public that sidewalks
should be constructed or that unsafe existing sidewalks be reconstructed, the city, by written
notice, shall require the owner of adjoining lands, or may, at its option, construct or replace
said sidewalks.
(1) Such sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the standard specifications for
installation of public sidewalks. The standard specifications for installation of public
sidewalks shall be developed by the Director of Public Works and revised from time to
time in accordance with generally accepted engineering practices for sidewalk
construction and installation. The Director of Public Works is also responsible for
establishing the reimbursement rate for sidewalk construction on an annual basis in
the spring of the year.
(2) The written notice shall be served upon the owner of adjoining lands, either
personally or by first-class prepaid mail, addressed to the last known address of the
owner as said address is shown on the records of the Assessor. If the name of the owner
or his last known address cannot be ascertained, notice shall be given by posting in a

STREETS AND SIDEWALKS
D. In cases where required the construction has been performed and verified, the cost of such

corner lots, which shall be assessed 50% for the shorter street frontage of the parcel and 25% for
the longer frontage. Tax-exempt entities shall pay the full cost of such construction.
E. Assessment of costs.
(1) Whenever expenditures are to be shared pursuant to §189-8D, the City Council shall
serve a notice of at least 10 days upon the owner of such property stating that such
expenditure has been made, its purpose and amount and that at a specified time and
place it will meet to make an assessment of the expenditure upon such land. The City
Council shall meet at the time and place specified. It shall hear and determine all
objections that may be made to such assessment, including the amount thereof, and shall
assess upon the land the amount as determined pursuant to § 189-8D, not exceeding the
amount stated in the notice.
(2) If the amount so assessed is not paid within 30 days after such assessment, an action to
recover the amount may be maintained by the city against the owner, or the amount
thereof may be included in the next annual tax levy, or if such sidewalk construction was
financed with municipal bonds, the amount may be levied annually during the term of
such municipal bonds. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prohibit the
financing of the amount of such unpaid assessments pursuant to the Local Finance Law.
F. If/when monies are made available by the Council during the annual budgetary process
for sidewalk construction, property owners are eligible for reimbursement in accordance
with paragraph “D” (above) based upon the established reimbursement rate until funds
have been exhausted. This is a first-come, first-serve program. Property owners wishing to
take advantage of this program are required to provide a “paid in full” invoice to the
Department of Public Works. The DPW will verify all work has been properly completed

snow and ice. The owner of every building or lot adjoining which there is a sidewalk shall
maintain the same in a state of good repair to provide safe passage to pedestrians. If any such
person shall fail, neglect, or refuse to comply with the requirements of this section, the Director
of Public Works may perform such work and the cost of the same, together with an additional
charge of 50% thereon to cover cost of supervision and administration by the city, shall
constitute a lien upon filing in the office of the City Comptroller and shall be collected at the
same time and in the same manner as general City taxes.
§ 189-10. Moving buildings or oversize loads.

§ 193-5. Application; review procedures.
A. Application. Whenever any subdivision of land showing a new street or highway is proposed
to be made, the subdivider shall apply in writing to the City Planning Board for approval of
such subdivision. The application of the subdivider shall conform to the requirements of §§
193-6, 193-7, 193-8 and 193-9 of this chapter. It is suggested that the proposed layout be
discussed informally with the Planning Board as early as possible and before any engineering
details are done. After the contours are prepared a sketch plan should be developed roughly
indicating street and lot location. The Planning Board's knowledge of development activities
and requirements should be of material assistance at this stage. It is further suggested that
sketches showing the future development of the total area, if larger than the initial
submission, be made and submitted for informal consideration by the Board prior to formal
submission of any portion thereof.
B. Required copies of preliminary layout plan.
(1) The subdivider shall submit to the City Planning Board three (3) copies of each:
193: 4
OGDENSBURG CODE
(a) The preliminary layout plan as described in § 193-8, at a scale of not more than
one hundred (100) feet to one (1) inch;
(b) A topographic map at the same scale; and
(c) Proposed street profile cross section and grading maps at appropriate scales.
(2) The preliminary layout will be jointly studied in connection with topography of the
area, Chapter 221, Zoning, and the requirements of local plans for the area. Particular
consideration will be given to the general requirements of the community, the best use
of the land to be subdivided and the suitability of the land for development. Provisions
for parks, playgrounds, school sites and other public use will be considered.
C. Tentative approval of preliminary plan. Upon tentative approval of the preliminary plan by
the City Planning Board, it will communicate in writing within thirty (30) days to the
subdivider, giving notice of:
(1) The specific changes to be made on the plan;
(2) The character and extent of the public improvements to be installed as a requirement of
final plan approval; and
(3) The amount of performance bond or other assurances acceptable to the Planning Board,
that the Planning Board will require in lieu of actual improvement construction.
D. Final approval of preliminary plan; time limit; filing of final subdivision plan.
(1) Upon completion of the changes requested by the City Planning Board, the subdivider
will receive final approval of the preliminary plan. Such approval will remain in full
force and effect for one (1) year thereafter, and within such time, the subdivider shall
file with the Planning Board original drawings, on tracing cloth, of the final subdivision
plan, grading plan and street profiles. These drawings shall be as described in § 193-9,
at a scale of not more than one hundred (100) feet to the one (1) inch.
(2) This may consist of all or part of the preliminary plan as finally approved by the
Planning Board. If it is only part of the total preliminary plan, the remainder must be
submitted for final approval within a reasonable period of time.
(a) Offer of cession. The subdivider shall tender offers of cession in a form certified
as satisfactory by the City Attorney of all land included in streets, highways or
parks, not specifically reserved by him, but approval of the plan by the Planning
Board shall not constitute an acceptance by the city of the dedication of any street,
highway, park or other public open space.
193: 5
SUBDIVISION OF LAND
(b) Public hearing; approval or disapproval of final plan. A public hearing shall be
held by the City Planning Board which hearing shall be advertised at least once in
a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Ogdensburg at least five (5) days
before such hearing. Upon receiving certificates of approval regarding the
adequacy and completion of improvements from the appropriate City
departments, the Planning Board shall then, within forty-five (45) days from the
date of submission of the final plan and such certificates, approve, modify and
approve or disapprove such plan; otherwise such plan shall be deemed to have
been approved and a certificate of the City Clerk as to the date of the submission
of the plan for approval and the failure to take action thereon within such time
shall be issued on demand and shall be sufficient in lieu of the written
endorsement or other evidence of approval herein required. The ground of refusal
of any plans submitted shall be stated upon the records of the City Planning
Board.
(c) Expiration of approval. The approval by the Planning Board or the certificate of
the City Clerk as to the date of the submission and the failure of the Planning
Board to take action thereon within forty-five (45) days, shall expire ninety (90)
days from the date of such approval or such certificate, unless within such ninety
(90) days such plan shall have been duly filed or recorded by the owner in the
office of the County Clerk or registrar.
E. Completion of improvements before final plat approval. The developer shall complete in
accordance with the requirements of the Planning Board all improvements listed in § 193-7
of this chapter; provided, however, that the Planning Board may waive, subject to appropriate
conditions and guarantees, for such period as it may determine, the provision of any or all
such improvements as in its judgment of the special circumstances of a particular plat or plats
are not requisite in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare. During and
after installation of the improvements, official inspection shall be made by the Director of
Planning and Development or his representatives who shall be at all times free to enter the
development area during the period of improvement installation. The Director of Planning
and Development shall issue certificates of approval to the City Planning Board upon
completion of the improvements in accordance with the standards and specifications herein
contained, such certificates to be a requirement to final plat approval. [Amended 12-12-1989
by Ord. No. 17-1989]
F. Performance bond in lieu of improvements. Alternatively, a performance bond sufficient to
cover the full cost of the required improvements as estimated by the Planning Board or other
appropriate city departments designated by the Planning Board shall be furnished to the city
by the subdivider. Such performance bond shall be issued by a bonding or surety company
approved by the City Attorney or by the subdivider with security acceptable to the City
Council, and shall also be approved by the City Attorney as to form, sufficiency and manner
of execution. Such performance bond shall run for a term to be fixed by the Planning Board,
but in no case for a longer term than three (3) years; provided, however, that the term of such
performance bond may be extended by the Planning Board with consent of the parties
thereto. [Amended 12-12-1989 by Ord. No. 17-1989]
193: 6
OGDENSBURG CODE
G. Modification. If the Planning Board shall decide at any time during the term of the
performance bond that the extent of building development that has taken place in the
subdivision is not sufficient to warrant all the improvements covered by such performance
bond or that required improvements have been installed as provided in these regulations and
by the Planning Board in sufficient amount to warrant reduction in the face amount of said
bond or that the character and extent of such development requires additional improvements
previously waived for a period stated at the time of fixing the original terms of said bond, the
Planning Board may modify its requirements for any or all such improvements, and the face
value of such performance bond shall thereupon be reduced or increased by an appropriate
amount so that the new face value will cover the cost in full of the amended list of
improvements required by the Planning Board and any security deposited with the bond may
be reduced or increased proportionately. [Amended 12-12-1989 by Ord. No. 17-1989]
H. Default. In the event that any required improvements have not been installed as provided in
this section within the term of such performance bond, the City Council may thereupon
declare said performance bond to be in default and collect the sum remaining payable
thereunder, and upon the receipt of the proceeds thereof the city shall install such
improvements as are covered by such performance bond and are commensurate with the
extent of building development that has taken place in the subdivision but not exceeding in
cost the amount of such proceeds.
§ 193-6. Design standards.
In addition to all other standards, specifications and codes adopted by the city, the following
principles of land subdivision, minimum requirements and standards of good design shall be
observed by the developer in all instances:
A. Land subject to flooding. Land subject to flooding and land deemed by the Planning Board to
be uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy, nor for such other uses as may
involve danger to health, life or property or aggravate the flood hazard, but such land within
the plan shall be set aside for such uses as shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional
inundation.
B. Streets and roads.
(1) Street system.
(a) The development plan shall conform to such plan or plans for the city as shall
have been prepared and adopted by the City Planning Board.
(b) Local residential streets in a new development should be so laid out as to

major streets into and from adjoining areas is required. If the subdivision abuts a
present or proposed primary or major thoroughfare, marginal interceptor streets
running parallel to the thoroughfare should be provided.
(c) At all times, the street layout should be logically related to the topography of the
land, as may be determined by the Planning Board.
193: 7
SUBDIVISION OF LAND

(g) Intersecting minor and secondary streets leading from the same subdivision shall
not empty into the same side of a major thoroughfare at intervals less than eight
hundred (800) feet.
(2) Street alignment.
(a) The minimum radius at the center line for curves on primary roads or major
thoroughfares shall be five hundred (500) feet; for collector streets or roads, three
hundred (300) feet; and for local residential streets it shall be one hundred fifty
(150) feet.
(b) Except for local residential streets, there shall be a tangent of at least one hundred
(100) feet measured at the center line between reverse curves.

vertical alignment. Measured along the center line, this should be four hundred
(400) feet for primary roads or major thoroughfares; two hundred (200) feet for
collect streets or roads; and one hundred (100) feet for local residential streets.
(d) Proper sight lines should be maintained at all intersections of streets. Measured
along the center line, there should be a clear sight triangle of seventy-five (75)
feet from point of intersection. No present or future building or obstruction will be

residential streets for distances of one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet
maximum.
193: 8
OGDENSBURG CODE
(b) Vertical curves shall be used in changes of grade exceeding one percent (1%) and
should be designed for maximum visibility. Intersections shall be approached on
all sides by leveling areas. Where the grade exceeds seven percent (7%), such
leveling areas shall have a minimum length of fifty (50) feet within which no
grade shall exceed a maximum of four percent (4%). The grade of actual
intersections shall not exceed one percent (1%) in any direction.
(4) Street widths.
(a) Minimum street and pavement widths are shown on the accompanying chart of
typical street cross sections.77
(b) Additional widths may be required by the Planning Board:
[1] Where required for public safety and convenience.
[2] For parking in commercial or public use areas.
[3] Where old streets do not provide the proper widths and additional dedication
is necessary.
(5) Street intersections.
(a) Multiple intersections involving the junction of more than four (4) roadways shall
be avoided, and where such avoidance is impossible, such intersections shall be
designed with extreme care for both vehicular and pedestrian safety.
(b) Right angle intersections shall be used whenever practicable especially when local
residential streets empty into major or collector thoroughfares, there shall be no
intersection angle, measured at the center line, of less than sixty degrees (60°)
minimum.
(c) Street curb intersections shall be rounded by a tangential arc with a minimum
radius of twenty (20) feet for local residential streets and thirty (30) feet for
intersections, including collector streets or roads and primary roads or major
thoroughfares.
(6) Other requirements.
(a) The dedication of half streets at the edge of a new subdivision is prohibited. If
circumstances rendered this impracticable, adequate provision for the concurrent
dedication of the remaining half of the street must be furnished by the subdivider.
The existence of a half street in an adjoining subdivision will require the
provision of the remaining half in the proposed subdivision.
77 Editor's Note: The chart of typical street cross sections is on file in the Planning Office.

streets shall bear the names of the existing streets, subject to the approval of the
Planning Board.
C. Blocks and lots.
(1) Blocks. In large blocks with interior parks, in exceptionally long blocks or where access
to a school or shopping center is necessary, a crosswalk with a minimum right-of-way
of ten (10) feet and a paved walk of at least four (4) feet in width shall be provided.
(2) Lots.
(a) The minimum lot size and frontage shall be controlled by the provisions of
Chapter 221, Zoning, of the Code of the City of Ogdensburg.
(b) All corner lots shall be one and one-half (1 1/2) times the minimum width of the
interior lots of the same block. All lots shall abut on a street, but double frontage
lots are prohibited. If, after subdividing, there exists remnants of land, they shall
be included in proposed or existing lot areas.
D. Building lines, utility easements and alleys.

forth in Chapter 221, Zoning, of the Code of the City of Ogdensburg.
(2) Utility easements. If easements are used at the rear of lots to provide sewer, water, gas
or electrical facilities, a minimum of ten (10) feet from the rear of each lot must be
provided.
(3) Alleys. Alleys are prohibited in residential developments. In commercial or industrial
districts without expressly designed loading areas, alleys with a minimum width of
twenty-two (22) feet shall be required. Where such alleys dead-end, they shall be
provided with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of not less than
seventy-five (75) feet.
E. Dedications and reservations for public land use. Areas for parks and playgrounds shall be
dedicated to the city and shall be of reasonable size. The Planning Board does not require an
arbitrary percentage of area, but in most cases, the developer should set aside not less than
ten percent (10%) of the area for these purposes. Where combinations of such areas with
adjoining developments are feasible, this should be done. In all instances, full compliance
with City plans is required, and the subdivider shall dedicate or reserve the needed portion of
his area for whatever public purpose is determined by such plans and indicated thereon.

operating income is hereby imposed from and after July 1, 1937, upon every other utility doing
business in the City of Ogdensburg which has a gross operating income for the 12 months ending
May 31 of each year, in excess of $500, which taxes shall have application only within the

199: 4
OGDENSBURG CODE
§ 199-3. Records to be kept.
Every utility subject to tax under this article shall keep such records of its business and in such
form as the City Comptroller may require, and such records shall be preserved for a period of
three years, except that the City Comptroller may consent to their destruction within that period
or may require that they be kept longer.
§ 199-4. Filing of returns.
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file on or before September 25, December 25, March
25 and June 25 of each year a return for the three calendar months preceding each such return
date, including any period for which the tax imposed hereby or by any amendment hereof is
effective, each of which returns shall state the gross income or gross operating income for the
period covered by each such return. Returns shall be filed with the City Comptroller on a form to
be furnished by him for such purpose and shall contain such other data, information or matter as
the City Comptroller may require to be included therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this section, any utility whose average gross income or average gross operating
income, as the case may be, for the aforesaid three-month periods is less than $1,500 may file a
return annually on June 25 for the 12 preceding calendar months and the City Comptroller may
require any utility to file an annual return, which shall contain any data specified by him,
regardless of whether the utility is subject to tax under this chapter. Every return shall have
annexed thereto a certification by the head of the utility making the same or of the owner or of a
copartner thereof or of a principal officer of the corporation, if such business be conducted by a
corporation, to the effect that the statements contained therein are true.
§ 199-5. Payment of tax.
At the time of the filing of a return as required by this chapter, each utility shall pay to the City
Comptroller the tax imposed by this article for the period covered by such return. Such tax shall
be due and payable at the time of filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last
day in which the return is required to be filed.
§ 199-6. Insufficient or unsatisfactory returns.
In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or unsatisfactory to the City
Comptroller and if a corrected or sufficient return is not filed within 20 days after the same is
required by notice from him or if no return is made for any period, the City Comptroller shall
determine the amount of tax due from such information as he is able to obtain and, if necessary,
may estimate the tax on the basis of external indices or otherwise. He shall give notice of such
determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably
fix such tax, unless the person against whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days, after the giving
of notice of such determination, apply to the City Comptroller for a hearing, or unless the City
Comptroller, of his own motion, shall reduce the same. After such hearing, the City Comptroller
shall give notice of his decision to the person liable for the tax. Such decision may be reviewed
by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York if
application therefor is made within 30 days after the giving of notice of such decision. An order
to review such decision shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed,
with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the City Comptroller and
an undertaking filed with him, in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme
199: 5
TAXATION
Court shall approve, to the effect that, if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the
applicant will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding,
or at the option of the applicant, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the tax,
interest, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which event the applicant shall not be required
to pay such tax, interest and penalties as a condition precedent to the granting of such order.
Except in the case of willfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no
assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the
date of the filing of a return; provided, however, that where no return has been filed as required
by this article the tax may be assessed at any time.
§ 199-7. Notices.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may be given by mailing
the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a postpaid envelope, addressed to such person
at the address given by him in the last return filed by him under this article or, if no return has
been filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice shall be
presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of
time which is determined according to the provisions of this article by the giving of notice shall
commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 199-8. Failure to file.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax or any portion thereof
within the time required by this article shall be subject to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax
due, plus 1% of such tax for each month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month,
after such return was required to be filed or such tax became due, but the City Comptroller, for
cause shown, may extend the time for filing any return and, if satisfied that the delay was
excusable, may remit all or any portion of the penalty fixed by the foregoing provisions of this
article.
§ 199-9. Refunds.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof shall make
application for a refund thereof and the City Comptroller or the court shall determine that such
tax or penalty or any portion thereof was erroneously or illegally collected, the City Comptroller
shall refund the amount so determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund may
be so made on the initiative of the City Comptroller. However, no refund shall be made of a tax
or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the Comptroller as hereinbefore provided unless
the City Comptroller, after a hearing as hereinbefore provided or of his own motion, shall have
reduced the tax or penalty or if it shall have been established in a proceeding under Article 78 of
the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York that such determination was
erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made out of moneys collected under this article,
deposited to the credit of the City Comptroller with the approval of the City Comptroller. An
application for a refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for the
revision of any tax or penalty complained of and the City Comptroller may receive additional
evidence with respect thereto. After making its determination, the City Comptroller shall give
notice thereof to the person interested, and he shall be entitled to commence a proceeding to
review such determination, subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained relating to the
commencement of such a proceeding.
199: 6
OGDENSBURG CODE
§ 199-10. Taxes not to be added to bills.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the utility and shall not be
added as a separate item to bills rendered by the utility to customers or others but shall constitute
a part of the operating costs of such utility.
§ 199-11. Failure to pay tax.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this article, the City
Attorney shall, upon the request of the City Comptroller, bring an action to enforce payment of
the same. The proceeds of any judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the City
Comptroller. Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person liable to
pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the tax and penalty imposed by
§ 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 199-12. Rules and regulations.
In the administration of this article, the City Comptroller shall have power to make such
reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, as may be necessary to the exercise
of his powers and the performance of his duties, and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and
other records relating to the administration and enforcement of the tax, to take testimony and
proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter within the line of his official duty under this
article and to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books,
papers and documents.
§ 199-13. Confidential information; exceptions.
Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be
unlawful for the City Comptroller or any agent, clerk or employee of the City of Ogdensburg,
New York, to divulge or make known in any manner the amount of gross income or gross
operating income or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any return under this article. The
officer charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or
evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on
behalf of the City of Ogdensburg, New York, in an action or proceeding under the provisions of
this article or on behalf of the State Tax Commission in an action or proceeding under the
provisions of the Tax Law of the State of New York, or on behalf of any party to any action or
proceeding under the provisions of this article when the returns or facts shown thereby are
directly involved in such action or proceeding; in either of which events the court may require
the production of and may admit in evidence so much of said returns or of the facts shown
thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding, and no more. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit the delivery to a person or his duly authorized representative of a copy of
any return filed by him, nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the
identification of particular returns and the items thereof, or the publication of delinquent lists
showing the names of persons who have failed to pay their taxes at the time and in the manner
provided for by this article, together with any relevant information which in the opinion of the
City Comptroller may assist in the collection of such delinquent taxes; or the inspection by the
City Attorney or other legal representative of the City of Ogdensburg, New York, of the return of
any person who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon, or against whom
an action has been instituted in accordance with the provisions of this article. Any offense
against the foregoing secrecy provisions shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by
199: 7
TAXATION
imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both, and if the offender is an officer, agent, clerk or
employee of the City of Ogdensburg, New York, he shall be dismissed from office and shall be
incapable of holding any office or employment for the City of Ogdensburg, New York, for a
period of five years thereafter. Notwithstanding any provisions of this article, the City
Comptroller may exchange with the chief fiscal officer of any city or any village of the State of
New York information contained in returns filed under this article, provided that such city or
village grants similar privileges to the City of Ogdensburg, New York, and provided that such
information is to be used for tax purposes only, and the City Comptroller shall, upon request,
furnish the State Tax Commission with any information contained in such returns.
§ 199-14. Disposition of taxes and penalties.
All taxes and penalties received by the City Comptroller under this article shall be paid into the
treasury of the City of Ogdensburg, New York, and shall be credited to and deposited in the
general fund of the City.

also a time of ownership by the transferee spouse and such ownership shall be deemed
continuous for the purpose of computing such period of 24 consecutive months, and provided
further that where property of the owner or owners has been acquired to replace property

Any conviction of having made any willful false statements in the application for such
exemption shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $100, and shall disqualify the applicant

ARTICLE IV
Veterans Tax Exemption
[Adopted 3-26-1984 as L.L. No. 3-1984
(Ch. 182 of the 1975 Ogdensburg Municipal Code)]
§ 199-35. Legislative intent.
The City of Ogdensburg has fully complied with all of the mandatory terms and provisions of
New York State Real Property Tax Law § 458. However, since the City of Ogdensburg
voluntarily changed its manner of assessment so as to implement full value assessment, the City
Council of the City of Ogdensburg has been required to review the applicability of Real Property
Tax Law § 458 to the newly completed assessment roll. On this review, it was determined that
the remedial action authorized by Real Property Tax Law § 458, Subdivision 5(a), should be
taken. It is for these reasons and pursuant to Real Property Tax Law § 458 that this article is
being enacted.
§ 199-36. Exemption increased.
The amount of the exemption granted to any qualifying veteran pursuant to Real Property Tax
Law § 458 prior to the date of the enactment of this article be and the same is hereby increased.
The increase granted in the allowable exemption shall be in the same proportion as the total
assessed valuation of property heretofore eligible for a veteran's exemption has been increased
by reason of the conversion to full value assessment.
§ 199-37. Conditions.
The following terms and conditions shall be applied in the implementation of this article:
199: 10
OGDENSBURG CODE
A. No application on behalf of any owner of property heretofore declared to be eligible for a
veteran's exemption pursuant to Real Property Tax Law § 458 shall be required. The
Assessor shall make the exemption adjustment based on previously allowed exemptions.
B. On adjustment of the allowable exemption, the Assessor shall make the appropriate entry
upon the assessment roll opposite the description of such property and subtract the total
amount of such adjusted exemption from the total amount assessed.
C. All other applicable provisions of Real Property Tax Law § 458 shall continue to be
complied with by the Assessor.
§ 199-38. Optional exemption. [Added 1-28-1985 by L.L. No. 2-1985; amended 3-10-2008
by L.L. No. 1-2008]
A. Qualifying residential real property shall be exempt from taxation to the extent of 15% of the
assessed value of such property; provided, however, that such exemption shall not exceed the
lesser of $12,000 or the product of $12,000 multiplied by the latest state equalization rate for
the City of Ogdensburg.
B. In addition to the exemption provided by Subsection A of this section where the veteran
served in a combat theater or combat zone of operations, as documented by the award of a
United States campaign ribbon or service medal, qualifying residential real property also
shall be exempt from taxation to the extent of 10% of the assessed value of such property;

A. Pursuant to § 458-b of the Real Property Tax Law of the State of New York, qualifying
residential real property owned by one or more persons qualifying as a Cold War veteran
shall receive an exemption from taxation equal to 15% of the assessed value of such
property; provided, however, that such exemption shall not exceed $12,000 or the product of
$12,000 multiplied by the latest state equalization rate for the City of Ogdensburg, whichever
is less.
B. In addition to the exemption provided by Subsection A of this section, where the Cold War
veteran received a compensation rating from the United States Department of Veterans

will be served upon all delinquents by leaving said notice at the last known address of the owner

on until measures for preventing such waste have been taken.
§ 215-21. Use by unauthorized persons.

nor any tap introduced into or connection made with said standpipe or tank.

persons are forbidden to interfere with them.
§ 215-29. Severing of pipes from main.
Whenever the water is shut off from any consumer for any reason and the Director of Public
Works shall deem such turning off is not sufficient prohibition against the further use of water
from such pipes, he may cause the pipes to be severed from the main.
§ 215-30. Inspections.
All premises where water is taken may, at any reasonable time, be inspected by a properly
authorized officer of the Department, and full authority is given the Director of Public Works to
order such inspection whenever he deems it for the good of the service.
§ 215-31. Sudden water stops; nonliability of City.

shut off the street mains for the purpose of making repairs, when there is no time to give notice

having boilers upon their premises, not supplied from tanks, are cautioned against danger from
collapse and owners of hydraulic lifts or of fixtures liable to injury from the sudden withdrawal
of water are hereby notified that the City will not be liable and shall not be held responsible for
such damage, in all cases where boilers are supplied; suitable check, vacuum, and air valves must
be applied to minimize danger from collapsing or water ram.

off.

A. Billing periods for metered customers.

OGDENSBURG CODE
D. Lien of flat-rate charges; collection. In the case of delinquent flat-rate charges, the proper
water charge or aggregate of various charges for all facilities as provided herein shall be
extended on the general tax roll at the same time as property taxes and other charges are
extended on such roll. The total water charges shall be added to the general City taxes and all
other charges appearing on said roll, which shall be payable as a part of the total charges.
Said water charges shall become a lien against the respective properties, upon delivery of
said tax roll to the City Comptroller for collection.
E. Delinquent water meter charges; collection. All delinquent water meter charges, as set forth
in Subsection B above, remaining unpaid at the close of a calendar year shall be added to the
general tax roll for the subsequent year. All such delinquent water meter charges shall be
collectible in the same manner and at the same time as other delinquent charges appearing on
the tax roll, and such delinquent water meter charges, upon being extended on the tax roll and
said roll being delivered to the City Comptroller for collection, shall become a lien upon such
property.
F. Fine for unreported flat-rate residential or commercial units.
(1) It is the responsibility of the property owner to verify that all units owned by him,
whether in single-family or multiple-dwelling residences or in commercial/residential
mixed structures, are recorded by the Comptroller's office and are being billed to the
property owner or his assignee. Failure to report individual billing units for the purpose
of flat rate billing to the Comptroller's office shall result in a fine of $500 per unit, upon
verification of such unit(s) by the City.
(2) Notice of such fine due shall be placed on the property owner for collection within 30
days of notice. An additional ten-percent penalty shall be added after 30 days from date
of billing. Unpaid fines remaining unpaid at the close of a calendar year shall be added
to the general tax roll for the subsequent year. Such unpaid fines shall be collectable in
the same manner and at the same time as other delinquent charges appearing on the tax
roll, and such fines, upon being extended on the tax roll and said roll being delivered to
the City Comptroller for collection, shall become a lien upon such property.
G. Vacant residential units.
(1) Flat rate billing for residential water service makes no distinction with regard to the
volume of water used over the course of a twelve-month period. Therefore, existing
units vacant less than twelve months in any calendar year will be subject to the full
annual water (and sewer) service charge.
(2) However, where a service is disconnected for an entire structure, the flat-rate fire
protection charge will apply. The fee for a service disconnect or seal is established at
$46 for a disconnect or seal and $46 for a reconnection of service.

than one year from date of filing of such claims. In no event shall claims for refunds for less
than one-fourth (1/4) of a year be allowable.

the minimum annual rate for fire protection, as herein provided, shall first be deducted from
total charges paid, and the refund for whatever fraction of a year is claimed shall be
computed against the remainder. In no event shall claims for refunds be allowed until the

§ 221-9. Interpretation of district boundaries.
A. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any zoning district, as shown on
the Official City of Ogdensburg Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
(1) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines,
such lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
(2) Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center lines of
roads or highways, or highway right-of-way lines, such center lines or right-of-way
lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
(3) Where the boundary of a district follows a river, stream, lake or other body of water,
said boundary shall be deemed to run down the center line of such body of water
between mean high water levels.
(4) Where the boundary of a district appears to follow a utility easement, such boundary
shall be deemed to be located in the middle of such easement.
B. In cases where the preceding rules do not clarify the true district boundary line, the Zoning
Administration Officer shall render a determination, which may be appealed to the Zoning
Board of Appeals. The Zoning Administration Officer or the Planning Board may request
the Zoning Board of Appeals to interpret the spirit and intent of this chapter to render a
determination on any specific case. [Amended 10-22-2007 by Ord. No. 10-2007]
C. Lots divided by zoning districts. [Amended 10-24-2011 by Ord. No. 4-2011]
(1) Whenever a single lot two acres or less in size is located within two or more different
zoning districts, the district regulation applicable to the district within which the
larger portion of the lot lies shall apply to the entire lot, provided that the combined
lot does not span a public right-of-way. If the combined lot spans a public right-ofway,
the district regulation applicable to the district within the larger portion of the lot
lies shall only apply if the total lot size is one acre or less.
(2) Whenever a single lot greater than two acres in size is located within two or more
different zoning districts, each portion of that lot shall be subject to all the regulations
applicable to the district in which it is located, if the combined lot does not span a
public right-of-way. If the combined lot does span a public right-of-way, each
portion of that lot shall be subject to all the regulations applicable to the district in
which it is located if the total lot size is one acre or less. Dimensions of each portion
of the lot shall be determined by the use of scale shown on the official City of
Ogdensburg ZoningMap.

Adaptive Reuse District (ARD) [Added 7-20-15 by Ord. No. 15-2015]
§221-22. District and Map.
Ogdensburg’s Adaptive Reuse District (ARD) is specifically mapped to include parcels that
exhibit pre-existing nonconforming land use patterns customarily associated with public, quasipublic
and institutional development across the City. The parcels that make up this district have
property class codes 600’s (community service land uses) or 800’s (public service land uses) and
are less than 2 acres in size. Over time, parcels may be added into or removed from this zoning
district as necessary through the standard zoning map amendment process.
§221-23. Purpose.
The purpose of this district is to (i) recognize the public, quasi-public, and institutional nature of
particular parcels of land and provide standards and guidelines for their continued use and future
adaptive reuse; (ii) to ensure that the developments within the district will be compatible with
surrounding zoning districts and uses; and (iii) promote development, community compatibility
and economic development by allowing the adaptive reuse of existing buildings and/or land uses,
which may have become obsolete, after public review. Adaptive Reuse permits a wider range of
land uses to be available to existing buildings and uses for the purpose of extending their useful
life.
§221-24. Submission and Review Procedure.
The following regulations shall apply to all land within the Adaptive Reuse District
A. Applicability of regulations for Adaptive Reuse Districts (ARD).

1) Plan documentation and supporting information. All drawings submitted must
be at a scale of not more than 50 feet to the inch. The site and development plan
221: 30
OGDENSBURG CODE

existing land use and development and in conformity with the
Comprehensive Plan (LWRP) of the City of Ogdensburg, New York,
including the applicable Brownfield Opportunity Area plan;
ii. Promote economic development, create and maintain compatible land uses
within the Adaptive Reuse District and with the surrounding area, promote

prescribed by Off-street parking, §221-51;
iv. Provide traffic control and street plan integration with existing and
planned public streets and interior access roads;

vi. Allocate adequate sites for all uses proposed - the design, character, grade,
location and orientation thereof to be appropriate for the uses proposed,
logically related to existing and proposed topographical and other
conditions, and consistent with the Comprehensive Plan (LWRP).
vii. Provide sidewalks along public streets, and other full control of access
frontages including, but not limited to, recreational trails as determined by
the ZBA. Sidewalks shall consist of the walkway and any curb ramps or
blended transitions. If required to be installed, the ZBA shall be guided by
the provisions of Chapter 189, Streets and Sidewalks and all relevant ADA
accessibility requirements.

of the public hearing required by §221-28 A. The ZBA’s final action, rendered in writing,
shall consist of either:
1) Approval of the adaptive reuse permit based upon a determination that the
proposed plan will constitute a suitable development and is in compliance with
the standards set forth in this section;

any recommendation for disapproval or approval with modifications made by the
City Zoning Board of Appeals or the County Planning Board under authority of §
239-m of the General Municipal Law, it may do so only with a majority plus one
vote of its full membership.
C. The City Council shall render a decision within 62 days following the completion of a
public hearing for an adaptive reuse permit.

persons or corporation or circumstances is held to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such
decision shall not effect the remaining provisions or clauses of the article or applications thereto

221: 35
ZONING
appropriate for residential, recreational, commercial or industrial use; or a combination of
these uses in a unified site design that allows economies of scale, creative planning and
design concepts to be used. The PDD allows for the planning of a project and the
calculation of densities over the entire development, rather than on an individual lot-by-lot
basis. This flexibility is intended to permit innovative planning and design concepts and not
merely a means to increase the density or bulk of a project without corresponding public
benefits.
B. To uphold the spirit and intent of this chapter to promote orderly growth and sound
development of the City and ensure that the health, safety and general welfare of
prospective residents in the PDD and adjacent residents will be protected.
§ 221-39. Minimum standards.
A PDD shall meet the following minimum standard for district area:
A. Undeveloped land: two acres.
B. Redeveloped land: 40,000 square feet.
§ 221-40. Submission and review procedure.
Development within a PDD requires City Council approval to amend the Zoning Map to
establish the PDD, based on the preliminary development plan; and Planning Board site plan
approval of proposed development within the established PDD. Where the City Council
establishes a PDD District the previous use and dimensional specifications are replaced by the
PDD standards, modifications required by the City Council in approving the establishment of the
PDD and modifications required by the Planning Board in approving development within the
PDD. The approved final site plan controls future land use and development in the district.
A. Presubmission conference. A presubmission conference between the applicant and the
Planning Board staff shall be held to discuss the proposal, outline the review procedure and
required submissions and inform the applicant of minimum standards and potential City
concerns of the conceptual project. This step is beneficial because the applicant will learn
his or her responsibilities before expending significant resources on the project.
B. Application for establishment of a PDD. Application for establishment of a PDD shall be
made to the City Council to approve the preliminary site plan and amend the City Zoning
Map. Application may be made by any party with legitimate interest in the parcel(s) of land
in question. Ownership or holding a bona fide accepted purchase contract with the owner's
consent shall be considered a legitimate interest.
C. Referral(s). The City Council shall refer the application to the City Planning Board within
10 days after receipt of the preliminary plans, and make any required referrals and
notifications necessary to comply with New York State law, including the State
Environmental Quality Review Act91 and §§ 239-m and 239-n of the General Municipal
Law.

Waterfront Overlay District (W)
§ 221-42. Purpose.
A. The purpose of the Waterfront Overlay District is to delineate an area coterminous with the
Ogdensburg Local Waterfront Revitalization Program (LWRP) Coastal Area whereby new
development and redevelopment will be reviewed for compatibility with the policies and
purposes of the LWRP.
B. As an overlay district, the Waterfront Overlay District does not replace the existing land use
districts and their provisions, but rather, represents an additional level of review,
superimposed on the provisions of the existing or underlying districts, that specifically
relates to the policies and purposes of the LWRP.
§ 221-43. Permitted uses.
All permitted uses as specified for the underlying land use districts, subject to all of the
requirements of the underlying land use districts, including the requirements and procedures of

A. Junkyard/salvage use.
ARTICLE XII
Determination of Use
§ 221-45. Determination of use. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall determine, after requesting
and receiving within 30 days a report from the Planning Board, whether a use not specifically
listed as a permitted use in any zoning district of the City is appropriate in the district where such
use is proposed. In making such determination the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider the
stated purpose of the zoning district and whether the proposed use is substantially similar in size,
density, operations, impacts and other characteristics of uses permitted in the district. If the
proposed unlisted use is found to be similar to uses specifically listed and appropriate in the
district, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall pass a resolution to treat the proposed use as a
permitted use in the district.

ZONING
E. General and specific standards. Accessory structures and uses shall be governed by the
following standards unless otherwise specified:
(1) All structures and uses accessory to a residence shall be consistent in character and
use with the principal residential use and the adjacent neighborhood.
(2) Accessory structures and uses in conjunction with a Planned Development District or
a principal use requiring site plan review shall be determined appropriate as to
number, type and location by the Planning Board in accord with its review of any
proposed use under these respective procedures.
(3) Unless otherwise specified, all accessory structures or uses shall not be less than six
feet from property lines in rear and side yards and shall fully comply with minimum
front yard requirements applicable to the principal structure in the zoning district.
Minimum yard requirements shall not apply to planters, flagpoles, mailboxes, bird
feeders and bird houses, fountains, firewood storage, security lighting and security
gates. Docks, piers and boathouses are exempt from rear yard requirements, but not
side yard requirements. [Amended 9-8-1992 by Ord. No. 13-1992; 4-7-2003 by
Ord. No. 6-2003]
(4) No accessory building shall be located closer than five feet to any principal or
accessory building, unless it is attached to such building.
(5) Specific standards for certain accessory structures or uses.
(a) Swimming pools.
[1] An enclosure of at least four feet in height shall be provided around
swimming pools to prevent accidental or unauthorized entry.
[2] Every gate or other opening in the enclosure shall be self-closing and selflatching.
[3] Where the proposed pool is of such height or design that a protective
enclosure is impractical or not required to prevent accidental entry, the Code
Enforcement Officer may issue a permit for the erection of a pool without
such enclosure upon making a written finding that the pool has equal
protection from entry as would be afforded by the erection of an enclosure.
[Amended 10-22-2007 by Ord. No. 10-2007]
[4] Any lighting used in conjunction with such pool shall be directed away from
adjoining properties and shall not substantially interfere with the use or
enjoyment of another lot.
[5] Aboveground swimming pools and associated decking more than two feet
from ground level shall be located no fewer than seven feet from any lot line
in a SFR District and no fewer than four feet in any other district. Ground
level decking shall be exempt from setback requirements. [Amended 9-8-
1992 by Ord. No. 13-1992]
221: 42
OGDENSBURG CODE
(b) Fences.
[1] A "fence" is defined, for the purposes of this chapter, as an artificially
constructed barrier of any material or combination of materials erected to
enclose or screen an area of land.
[2] All open, solid or opaque fences, no taller than 6 1/2 feet in height on the
side and rear yards or four feet in height on the front yard and, if a corner
lot, on the side yard, are permitted with a building permit, provided that
such fencing:
[a] Does not block visibility of on-coming traffic at intersections or
driveways; and
[b] Projects a finished side outward towards adjoining lots.
(c) Signs. Signs shall be regulated according to § 221-42, Signs.
(d) Certain domestic animal shelters. No structure to provide shelter for sheep,
horses, goats, chickens or other fowl shall be permitted unless such structure,
and any associated manure pile, is located at least 75 feet from all property
boundaries.
(e) Second residence on the lot. A dwelling unit, as an accessory residence to a
principal structure or use, may be located on the same lot, provided that a
separate lot could be formed for each residence which would comply with all lot
area, width, setback and sanitary requirements for the zoning district in which
the property is located.
(f) Accessory boarding. The renting out of one or two rooms within an existing
single-family residence (which one or two rooms do not constitute a separate
dwelling unit) to not more than two persons who are not members of the family
that resides in the single-family residence shall be permitted if the boarding can
be adequately accommodated with no more than the creation of one additional
off-street parking space.
(g) Accessory apartments.
[1] For the purpose of this chapter, an "accessory apartment" shall be defined as
a housing unit that is self-contained with separate cooking facilities, but is
principally incorporated within an existing structure that was originally
designed for a single-family residence and will not be substantially altered.
[2] Purpose. Allowing one accessory apartment per principal structure permits
homeowners to stay in their homes and neighborhoods in the face of fixed
or reduced incomes, lowered space needs, health care needs and rising
expenses for utilities, taxes and maintenance without significantly impacting
the surrounding neighborhood.
221: 43
ZONING
[3] One accessory structure per principal residence is permitted, provided that it
satisfies the following standards:
[a] No more than one apartment shall be created within a residence.
[b] The apartment shall be a complete, separate housekeeping unit that can
be isolated from the original unit.
[c] An owner of the residence in which the accessory structure is created
shall occupy one of the dwelling units on the premises.
[d] The accessory apartment shall be designed so that, to the degree
reasonably feasible, the appearance of the building remains that of a
one-family residence. In general, any new entrances shall be located on
the side or in the rear of the building, and any addition shall not increase
the total residential square footage on the lot more than 10% of the
original house.
[e] Adequate off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with § 221-
41, Off-street parking and loading.
(h) Home occupations.
[1] Definition. A "home occupation" is a business operated out of a home;
specifically, it is defined as an accessory occupation or business activity
which results in a product or service for financial gain that is conducted in
whole or part on the residential premises.
[2] Purpose. The intent of regulations governing home occupations is to protect
the character of the surrounding neighborhood, particularly adjacent
residential uses, from intrusions and nuisances created by operating
businesses in a residential area, while recognizing the needs of certain
residents and community benefits of allowing certain types of work in the
home. Customary and inconspicuous businesses, such as accounting,
alterations, hair care, word processing, consulting, drafting, telephone
surveys or sales, graphic design, photography, office uses, instruction,
baking and arts and crafts production are examples of home occupations
that can usually satisfy the minimum standards for home occupations.
[3] Prohibited home occupations. The following businesses are prohibited as
home occupations: automotive vehicle repair, body shop, machine shop,
welding shop, salvage yard, auto or vehicle sales and commercial outdoor
storage or parking.
[4] Standards for permitted home occupations. Home occupations are permitted
if they meet all of the following standards:
[a] There shall be no employees other than residents of the premises where
the home occupation is proposed to be located.
221: 44
OGDENSBURG CODE
[b] The home occupation shall not significantly change the exterior
appearance of the residence, other than the addition of one sign as
permitted in § 221-42, Signs.
[c] Retail sales of products not produced on the premises shall be prohibited
except for the sale of products incidental to services offered by the home
occupation.
[d] No business activities involving clients or customers on the premises or
vehicular traffic shall be conducted between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and
7:30 a.m.
[e] The home occupation shall produce no noise, vibrations, glare,
objectionable fumes or electrical interference detectable to normal
sensory perception on adjacent lots.
[f] Exterior storage of supplies, items or equipment associated with the
home occupation shall be prohibited.
[g] No new off-street parking spaces shall be needed or created to serve the
home occupation.
[h] Instruction to students and services to clients or customers shall be
limited to not more than 10 persons at any one time.
(i) Bed-and-breakfast. [Added 9-29-1992]
[1] Definition. An owner-occupied place of lodging that has four guest rooms
or fewer and may serve meals only to guests, except that in single-family
residential districts the Planning Board may permit bed-and-breakfast by
special permit subject to the following additional purposes and standards in
addition to all other applicable sign, parking and site plan considerations.
[2] Purpose. The intent of further regulating bed-and-breakfast operations in
single-family residential districts is to protect the character of the
surrounding neighborhood, particularly adjacent residential uses, from
intrusions and nuisances created by operating businesses in a residential
area, while recognizing the needs of certain residents and community
benefits of allowing restricted bed-and-breakfast operations in single-family
residential districts.
[a] There shall be no employees other than residents of the premises where
the bed-and-breakfast is proposed to be located.
[b] The bed-and-breakfast shall not change the exterior appearance of the
residence, other than the addition of one sign as permitted in singlefamily
residential districts.
[c] There shall be no other accessory boarding or accessory apartment
permitted at the premises where the bed-and-breakfast is proposed to be
221: 45
ZONING
located.
[d] The bed-and-breakfast shall produce no noise, vibrations, glare,
objectionable fumes or electrical interference detectable to normal
sensory perception on adjacent lots.
[e] In SFR districts the minimum lot size for a bed-and-breakfast shall be
one acre.
[f] There shall be no more than two rooms made available for the purposes
of operating a bed-and-breakfast in single-family residential districts.
[g] Exterior storage of supplies, items or equipment associated with the bedand-
breakfast shall be prohibited.
[h] Any permission granted shall be personal to the grantee. Upon sale of
the property, the special permit shall be null and void and the new
owners shall be made to reapply.
(j) Handicap ramps. Handicap ramps shall be exempt from all minimum yard
setbacks in all districts. All construction shall fully comply with state and
federal standards. [Added 3-27-1995 by Ord. No. 4-1995]
(k) Christmas tree sales. The Planning Board may permit the display and sale of
natural Christmas trees in a Single-Family Residential District by special permit
subject to the following criteria, in addition to all other applicable regulations.
[Added 10-14-1997 by Ord. No. 9-1997]
[1] Criteria.
[a] The display and sale of natural trees shall be permitted between
November 15 and December 31 and between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and
10:00 p.m.
[b] The tree sale shall not change the exterior appearance of the residence,
other than the addition of one sign as permitted in a single-family
residential district.
[c] There shall be no other accessory uses or home occupations permitted at
the premises where the tree sale is proposed to be located.
[d] Adequate parking shall be provided.
§ 221-48. Open storage of inoperative or unregistered motor vehicles. [Amended 4-7-2003
by Ord. No. 5-2003; amended 9-28-2009 by Ord. No. 13-2009]
Except as otherwise provided for in Statute or City Regulations, open storage of two or more
inoperative or unlicensed motor vehicles shall not be parked, kept or stored on any
premises. Storage of a single unregistered motor vehicle shall be permitted in all residential
221: 46
OGDENSBURG CODE
districts provided that its body is completely covered by a fitted cover or tarp in good repair that
is securable to the vehicle and free of foreign objects placed upon the cover.
§ 221-49. Public garages and gasoline filling stations. [Amended 12-7-1992 by L.L. No. 3-
1992]
A. Minimum lot area. The minimum lot area shall be 15,000 square feet, and the minimum
frontage shall be 100 feet.
B. Driveway requirements. Entrance and exit driveways shall have an unrestricted width of not
less than 20 feet, shall not be located nearer than 10 feet to any lot line or 20 feet from any
intersection and shall be so laid out as to avoid the necessity of any vehicle backing into
any public right-of-way.
C. Distance from street line. No gasoline filling station building and no outdoor gasoline or oil
pump or automotive service appliance shall be erected within 20 feet of any street line.
D. Enclosure of vehicle parts. Vehicle lifts or pits, dismantled automobiles, all parts or
supplies, goods, materials, refuse, garbage or debris shall be located within a building
enclosed on all sides.
E. Repairs and servicing. Commercial motor vehicle repair or service shall not be permitted in
connection with or as part of a public garage.
F. Out-of-door work restricted. Major repair work may be carried on outdoors only where it is
impractical to do such work within a building, but in no case shall any vehicle being
repaired be stored outdoors for a period exceeding 30 days. Gasoline or oil sales, changing
of tires and other similar automobile servicing shall not be considered to be major repair
work.
G. Underground storage of gas or flammable oils. Gasoline or flammable oils in bulk shall be
stored fully underground, not nearer than 10 feet to any street line or 35 feet to any lot line.
§ 221-50. Outdoor vending machines; outdoor sales.
A. No open-front stores, outdoor vending machines or other outdoor storage, displays or sales,
except as indicated in Subsection C below, other than the following:
(1) The sale of automobile fuel, lubricants and accessories at automobile service station.
(2) The storage and sale of lumber and other building materials in duly conducted
lumberyards.
(3) Automobile off-street parking and off-street loading.
(4) Signs erected in conformity with the individual district regulations.
(5) Nurseries.
(6) Vending machines, provided that no more than three per business establishment, and
221: 47
ZONING
further provided that such machines shall be no closer than five feet to any property
line. [Amended 12-7-1992 by L.L. No. 3-1992]

C. In appropriate cases and in accordance with the requirements in Article V, the Planning
Board may issue a special permit permitting any use not otherwise permitted under the
terms of this section in a nonresidence district.
§ 221-51. Off-street parking and loading.
A. Purpose. It is the objective of this section to provide standards for providing adequate offstreet
parking and loading of motor vehicles in an orderly and efficient manner that retains
the function of the road network and protects the health, safety and general welfare of the
public.
B. Procedure. Any structure or use requiring a permit under this chapter shall comply with the
parking, loading and design standards specified in this section. Site plans will be reviewed
by the Planning Board for compliance with these requirements. Reasonable and appropriate
off-street parking requirements for structures and uses which do not fall within the
categories listed herein shall be determined by the Planning Board during site plan review
and upon consideration of factors entering into the parking needs of each such use.
C. Design.
(1) Parking space. The minimum size of each parking space shall measure 10 feet in
width and 20 feet in length, not including any required maneuvering aisle, circulation
lane, right-of-way, easement or public road. All required parking spaces shall be
individually identified by means of pavement markings or other identification.
(2) Access. Unobstructed access to and from a street shall be provided for all parking
spaces. Entrances, exits and driveways for off-street parking areas shall be at least 10
feet wide but no more than 30 feet wide, except lots with frontage of at least 100 feet
per street which can be no more than 36 feet wide. Frontage of all commercial
properties shall be controlled by positive means such as curbing or ditches to provide
access only at designated driveways. The purpose of access control is to direct
entering and exiting vehicles into a well-defined flow pattern and separate traffic
movements on private property from street and highway traffic. No more than two
driveways (excluding field entrances) with a combined total width of 66 feet per
street shall be allowed unless the Planning Board deems additional driveways are
necessary to adequately and safely manage the parking, loading, access and
circulation needs of the land use. [Amended 10-28-1996 by Ord. No. 15-1996]
(3) Circulation. All parking areas shall be designed so as to eliminate the need for
vehicles to back out onto state roads or block entrances to parking areas. Off-street
parking areas with more than six spaces shall direct vehicles into a well-defined flow
pattern. A minimum ten-foot-wide circulation lane shall be provided for parking areas
with more than six spaces. For parking area layouts requiring two-way traffic, a
221: 48
OGDENSBURG CODE
minimum twenty-foot-wide circulation lane is required.
(4) Location.
(a) Parking area. Parking areas shall not be located in required front yards except
that no more than two vehicles may be parked in a front yard driveway. Parking
areas may be located to within three feet of adjoining properties in the rear or
side yards, provided that screening requirements are satisfied.
(b) Driveways. Existing driveways may be surfaced or reconstructed to within one
foot of an adjoining property line. Newly constructed driveways may be built to
within three feet of an adjoining property unless there is a written agreement
between adjoining property owners to share a driveway, in which case no
setback is required.
(c) Entrances and exits. No entrance or exit for any off-street parking area with
more than six spaces shall be located within 40 feet of any street intersection.
(5) Surface condition and drainage. All parking areas shall be kept well maintained and
free of debris. For all commercial uses or when more than six parking spaces are
required for a use, the parking area shall consist of a designated and improved area
composed of a minimum of six inches of compacted stabilized surface consisting of
crushed rock or crushed stone, surfaced and covered with blacktop or concrete, or a
combination thereof. A driveway or parking area shall not drain onto an adjacent
property unless the property owner's permission is received in writing. In no case
shall the construction of parking areas or driveways cause water to flow across
sidewalks or street pavement or to pond off site.
(6) Sight lines. Driveways, vegetation and fencing shall be located so that any vehicle
leaving the driveways shall have clear and unobstructed view for a reasonable and
safe sight distance to any oncoming traffic, considering the marked speed limit in the
area and the quantity of traffic.
(7) Maintenance. All required parking spaces and circulation aisles shall be available for
parking and loading and not be used for the storage of unlicensed vehicles, materials
or waste disposal facilities.
(8) Screening. Parking areas with more than six spaces shall be visually screened from:
(a) Adjacent residential uses;
(b) SFR, MDR and R/B Zoning District boundaries; and
(c) State or locally designated tourism routes or historic properties.
(9) Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas should be located,
shielded and directed upon the parking area in such a manner that it does not reflect
or cause glare onto adjacent properties or interfere with street traffic. In no instance
shall bare, unshaded bulbs be used for such illumination.
221: 49
ZONING
D. Mixed uses. In the event that several uses occupy a single structure or parcel of land, the
total requirements shall be the sum of the requirements of the several uses computed
separately. Employees working at more than one use on the parcel shall not be doublecounted
when computing the required number of parking spaces.
E. Shared parking. The off-street parking requirements of two or more uses, structures or
parcels of land may be satisfied by the same parking or loading space used jointly to the
extent that it can be demonstrated by the applicant that their operations and parking needs
do not overlap in time.
F. Parking overload. Notwithstanding the above requirements, an observed overload of

A. Purpose. The purpose of the sign regulations is to promote and protect the public health,
welfare and safety by regulating advertising visible from public roads and other outdoor
graphics for commercial gain. These regulations are intended to protect property values,
maintain an attractive business climate and protect the physical appearance of the
community. The regulations are further intended to reduce distractions and obstructions that
may contribute to traffic accidents or safety hazards.
B. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
BILLBOARD -- An off-premises sign owned by a person, corporation or other entity that
engages in the business of selling advertising space on that sign.
COPY-CHANGE SIGN -- A sign on which the visual message may be periodically
changed.
FREESTANDING SIGN -- A sign that is attached to, erected on or supported by some
structure (such as a pole, mast, frame or other structure) that is not itself an integral part of
or attached to a building or other structure whose principal function is something other than
the support of a sign.
GATEWAY SIGNS -- The generally accepted logos of not-for-profit, charitable, public and
religious organizations mounted together on a unified and uniform field background, with
the size of each constituent sign not to exceed nine square feet. Total sign area at each
entrance to the City may not exceed 128 square feet, with its highest point not exceeding 12
feet from ground level, and with its lowest point not closer than four feet to ground level.
OFF-PREMISES SIGN -- A sign that draws attention to or communicates information
about a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction or other enterprise or
activity that exists or is conducted, sold, offered, maintained or provided at a location other
than the premises on which the sign is located.

roof of a building or structure.
SHOPPING CENTER -- A group of architecturally unified commercial establishments
built on a site, planned, developed, owned and managed as a unified development, which

ZONING
SIGN AREA -- The total area of the smallest rectangle or triangle which encloses the
extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with any
material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not
including any supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display
itself.
TEMPORARY SIGN -- A sign that is used in connection with a circumstance, situation or
event that is designed, intended or expected to take place or to be completed within a
reasonably short or definite period after the erection of the sign. Under no circumstances
may a temporary sign remain on the lot where it is erected or placed for a period of more
than 60 days in any six-month period.
C. Administration.
(1) Permits. No sign shall be erected, moved, enlarged, reconstructed or substantially

receiving a complete application, either approve or deny the building permit as
regards this section or the regulations governing nonconforming structures. An

A. Purpose. It is the purpose of this section that large residential developments shall be
required to provide open space for residents of the development and, in some cases, for the
general public. Developed open space shall be designed to provide recreational facilities to
serve the residents of the development. Undeveloped open space shall be designed to
preserve important site amenities and environmentally sensitive areas.
B. Every residential development involving 25 or more housing units shall be developed so
that at least 5% of the total area of the development remains permanently as usable open
space.
C. For the purposes of this section, "usable open space" means an area that:
(1) Is not encumbered with any substantial structure.
(2) Is not devoted to use as a roadway, parking area, sidewalk, storm drainage area or
storage area.
(3) Has no dimension measuring less than 20 feet.
(4) Consists of land no more than 25% of which lies within a "floodway" or "area of
special flood hazard" as defined in Chapter 105, Flood Damage Prevention.
(5) Is left (as of the date development began) in its natural or undisturbed state if
wooded, except for the cutting of trails for walking, jogging or bicycling; is
landscaped for ballfields, picnic areas or similar facilities; or is properly vegetated
and landscaped with the objective of creating public waterfront access, a wooded area
or other area that is consistent with the objectives set forth in Subsection C(6).
(6) Is capable of being used and enjoyed for purposes of informal and unstructured
recreation and relaxation.
(7) Is legally and practicably accessible and usable to the residents of the development
out of which the required usable open space is taken, or to the public if the City
agrees that it will accept an offer of dedication of such open space.
D. Exceptions to the standards. The Planning Board may permit minor deviations from usable
open space requirements when it can be determined that:
(1) The objectives underlying these standards or the goals of this chapter can be met
without strict adherence to them; and/or
(2) Because of peculiarities in the tract of land or the facilities proposed, it would be
unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards.

association or similar organization that satisfies the criteria for responsible upkeep
and proper maintenance of the required usable open space area.
(2) Deed restrictions. Any lands dedicated for open space purposes shall contain
appropriate covenants and deed restrictions ensuring that:
(a) The usable open space area shall not be subdivided in the future;
(b) The use of the usable open space will continue in perpetuity for the purpose
specified; and
(c) Common undeveloped usable open space shall not be turned into a commercial

responsible for the maintenance and control of common areas, including recreational
facilities and open space, shall be established in such a manner that:
(a) Provision for the establishment of the association or similar entity is made
before any lot in the development is sold or any building is occupied.
(b) The association or similar legal entity has clear legal authority to maintain and
exercise control over such common areas and facilities.

from residents of the development to cover their proportionate shares of the
costs associated with the maintenance and upkeep of such common areas and
facilities.

C. Temporary structures requiring a building permit. The following temporary structures may
be permitted for up to one year upon application to the Code Enforcement Officer. The
temporary building permit may be extended for good cause with approval from the
Planning Board. [Amended 10-22-2007 by Ord. No. 10-2007]
(1) Emergency or temporary residence. A residence (which may be a mobile home) that
is:
(a) Located on the same lot as a residence made uninhabitable by fire, flood or
other natural disaster and occupied by the persons displaced by such disaster,
and is removed upon completion of a new permanent residence; or
(b) Located on the same lot as a residence that is under construction and occupied
by the persons intending to live in such permanent residence when the work is
completed, and is removed upon completion of the permanent residence.
§ 221-55. Nonconforming lots, uses and structures.
A. Purpose.
(1) It is the purpose of this section to provide for the regulation of legally nonconforming
structures, lots of record and uses, and to specify those circumstances and conditions
221: 62
OGDENSBURG CODE
under which such nonconformities shall be permitted to continue.
(2) This chapter is designed to guide future land use in Ogdensburg by encouraging
appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses and to promote and protect the
public health, safety and general welfare. The continued existence of nonconformities
is frequently inconsistent with these purposes. Nonconformities may adversely affect
planned development and may diminish the value of nearby property. Therefore, the
gradual elimination of such nonconformities is generally desirable.
B. Nonconforming lots of record.
(1) A nonconforming lot of record is any validly recorded lot which, at the time it was
filed with the County Clerk, fully complied with all applicable laws at that time but
which does not fully comply with the lot requirements of this chapter concerning
minimum area, minimum lot depth or minimum lot width. Lots created prior to any
zoning law of the City also are covered by this section.
(2) A nonconforming lot of record may be used for any permitted or conditional use
allowed in the district in which the lot is located, provided that the following
conditions exist or are met:
(a) The owners of the lot own no adjoining land which would create a conforming
lot if combined with the lot which is deficient in area, width or depth.
(b) Any use which will require a water supply and/or sewage disposal shall be
connected to City water and/or sewer services.
(c) Any structure or use located on a nonconforming lot shall provide front, side
and rear yards conforming to the minimums required for the district in which the
lot is located, except as may be otherwise approved by the Board of Appeals
under the area variance process provided in § 221-73.
C. Nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use is an activity using land, buildings, signs or
structures for purposes which were legal at the time they were established, but which would
not be permitted to be established as a new use in the district in which it is located by the
terms of this chapter. Any nonconforming use may be continued subject to the following
provisions:
(1) Discontinuance. Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a period
of 18 months or more, any future use shall conform to the use regulations for the
zoning district in which the site is located. [Amended 11-12-1996 by Ord. No. 23-
1996]
(2) Change of use. If a nonconforming use is replaced by another use, the new use shall
conform to this chapter. Once changed to a conforming use, no structure or land shall
be permitted to revert to a nonconforming use. Changes from one nonconforming use
to a different nonconforming use is prohibited.
(3) Additional nonconforming uses. No new nonconforming uses are permitted, except as
may be otherwise approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals according to the use
221: 63
ZONING
variance process.
(4) Expansion. Nonconforming uses shall not be expanded or enlarged to occupy a
greater area of land than was occupied by the nonconforming use at the effective date
of this chapter, except as may be otherwise approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals
according to the use variance process.
(5) Destruction.
(a) A nonconforming use which has been changed by fire or other causes, to the
extent of not more than 75% of its replacement cost, may be permitted to
recontinue as before or may be reconstructed to the size that existed before the
damage, as measured in square footage of lot coverage, provided that a building
permit is applied for within one year and site plan review is done by the
Planning Board.
(b) If a nonconforming use has been damaged by fire or other causes, to the extent
of more than 75% of its replacement cost, the nonconforming use shall only be
permitted to recontinue if the use is permitted within a zoning district not more
than two districts removed from the district in which the nonconforming use is
located. For the purposes of this section, the continuum of zoning districts is as
follows:
[1] Single-Family Residential (SFR).
[2] Moderate-Density Residential (MDR).
[3] Residential/Business (R/B).
[4] Business (B).
[5] Industrial and Institutional (I/I).
(c) Therefore, the following table explains which nonconforming uses which have
been more than seventy-five-percent damaged may be recontinued:
Zoning Classification of Uses, by Zoning District, That
Nonconforming Use May be Recontinued
SFR SFR, MDR, R/B
MDR SFR, MDR, R/B, B
R/B SFR, MDR, R/B, B, I/I
B MDR, R/B, B, I/I
Zoning Classification of Uses, by Zoning District, That
Nonconforming Use May be Recontinued
I/I R/B, B, I/I
221: 64
OGDENSBURG CODE
(d) Uses that are permitted to recontinue may only be reconstructed to the size that
existed prior to the damage, as measured in square footage of lot coverage.
D. Nonconforming structures. A nonconforming structure is any building or structure legally
existing prior to this chapter which does not comply with the height or yard requirements of
this chapter. Any nonconforming structure may be continued and maintained subject to the
following provisions:
(1) Expansion. A nonconforming structure may be expanded, provided that such
expansions will meet any front, side and rear yard requirements.
(2) New or additional nonconforming structures. The introduction of any new or
additional nonconforming structures is prohibited unless approved by the Zoning
Board of Appeals according to the area variance process.
(3) Destruction. A nonconforming structure which has been damaged by fire or other
causes may be restored or reconstructed, provided that a building permit is applied for
within one year, and the reconstruction shall not further aggravate setback or height
regulations more than the original structure.
(4) Completion of structure. Nothing contained in this section shall require any change in
the plans, construction or alteration of a structure for which a valid building permit
has been issued and work has commenced prior to the effective date of this chapter.
(5) Moving. Should any structure be moved for any reason or for any distance, it shall
thereafter conform to the setback and height regulations for the district in which it is
located after it is moved.
E. Accessory structures without a principle use. For the purposes of this section a front yard
shall be defined as 20’ from the property line, parallel with the street. All accessory
structures shall not be less than six feet in rear and side yards and shall fully comply with
minimum front yard requirements as defined by this section. The intent of this section is to
promote the orderly development of vacant lots subject to the following provisions: [Added
9-9-2013 by Ord. No. 15-2013]
(1) Special permitted uses:
(a) Fences. Table 1 – Dimensional Regulations shall not apply to accessory
structures without a principle use. All open, solid or opaque
fences, no taller than 6½ feet in height on the side and rear yards or
4 feet in height on the front yard. All other regulations per § 221-
37.E(5)(b)(2) shall apply.
(b) Sheds. One shed, which shall be no larger than 150 square feet and shall
be constructed on a non-permanent foundation.
(c) Driveways. Driveways shall maintain a minimum of 3 feet from the edge of
pavement to the property line.
(d) Docks, piers and boathouses.

ARTICLE XV
Environmental Quality Review
§ 221-56. Purpose.
The general purpose of the State Environmental Quality Review Act93 is to incorporate the
consideration of environmental factors into planning, review and decision-making processes of
local governments at the earliest possible time. To this end, SEQR requires that all agencies
determine whether the actions they directly undertake, fund or approve may have a significant
effect on the environment, and, if it is determined that the action may have a significant effect on
the environment, prepare or request an environmental impact statement. Article 8 and Part 617 of
Title 6 of the New York Code of Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) are hereby adopted by
reference. A summary discussion of the basic SEQR review procedures follows to supplement 6
NYCRR Part 617.
§ 221-57. Process completion required.
Completion of the SEQR process shall be required before an application is deemed complete. No
final action shall be taken on an application until it has complied with SEQR. Therefore, time
deadlines for review and decision making on applications shall not begin until the SEQR process
has been completed.
§ 221-58. Applicability.
A. Projects or physical activities which meet at least one of the following criteria are subject to
review under SEQR:
(1) Are directly undertaken by the City;
(2) Involve funding by the City; or
(3) Require a discretionary permit from the City or its appointed boards.
B. If the proposed action does not require a discretionary decision there is no requirement for
review under SEQR.
§ 221-59. Classification of action.
If a proposed action is subject to review under SEQR, the first step is to classify the action into
one of five categories.
A. Classes of action requiring no further review under SEQR:
(1) Exempt. These are actions such as maintenance, repair, emergency or
nondiscretionary permitting which do not require further review. See Section
617.2(q) for the list of Exempt Actions.94
93 Editor's Note: See Art. 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law.
94 Editor's Note: Original Subsection a(2), which dealt with actions reviewable under the Public Service Law or
221: 66
OGDENSBURG CODE
(2) Type II. An action that never produces significant environmental impacts and does
not require the preparation of a determination of significance or a draft environmental
impact statement (EIS). Type II actions are defined by the list in Section 617.13.
B. Classes of action which require further review under SEQR:
(1) Type I. An action that is likely to produce significant environmental impacts and may
require the preparation of a draft environmental impact statement. At a minimum, a
full Environmental Assessment form (EAF) must be completed and a determination
of significance made. Type I actions are defined by the list in Section 617.12.
(2) Unlisted. All actions which are not Type I, Type II Exempt or Excluded are
considered unlisted. At a minimum, an unlisted action requires that a short EAF be
completed and a determination of significance made which may require the
preparation of a draft environmental impact statement (EIS).
§ 221-60. Environmental assessment forms.
An EAF must be completed for all Type I and unlisted actions.
A. Type I actions. A full EAF must be prepared for all Type I actions. The project
sponsor/applicant completes Part 1 of the form and submits it to an involved agency. When
the lead agency is established, that agency is responsible for completing Parts 2 and 3 of the
full EAF.
B. Unlisted actions. A short EAF must, at a minimum, be completed for all unlisted actions.
The project sponsor/applicant completes Part 1 of the form and submits it to an involved
agency. When the lead agency is established, that agency is responsible for completing
Parts 2 and 3 of the short EAF. An agency may require a full EAF if the short EAF will not
provide sufficient information to assess the environmental impact of the proposed action.
§ 221-61. Lead agency.
A. If there is only one agency approving, funding or directly undertaking an action, that
agency is automatically the lead agency. If there are two or more involved agencies, a lead
agency must be established by agreement of the agencies within 30 calendar days. If the
lead agency cannot be agreed on, any of the involved agencies or the applicant can petition
the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner to resolve
the dispute and designate the lead agency.
B. For zoning or subdivision actions reviewed by the City, the following bodies shall be the
lead agency, unless otherwise delegated by the City Council.
(1) Map or text amendments to this chapter: City Council.
by the Adirondack Park Agency, and immediately followed this subsection, was deleted at time of adoption of
Code; See Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II.
221: 67
ZONING
(2) Site plan and subdivision applications: Planning Board.
(3) Variances: Zoning Board of Appeals.
§ 221-62. Determinations of significance.
A. For Type I and unlisted actions the lead agency has 20 calendar days to make its
determination of significance. If the lead agency finds that it does not have sufficient
information to make this determination, it shall request that the applicant provide it.
B. In determining significance the lead agency shall consider:
(1) The whole action;
(2) The EAF and any other information provided by the applicant;
(3) Any comments from involved agencies;
(4) The criteria in Section 617.11; and
(5) Public comments.
C. Negative declaration.
(1) A negative declaration means that the lead agency has determined that the proposed
action will not have a significant effect on the environment and a draft EIS will not be
prepared. Every negative declaration shall identify the relevant areas of
environmental concern; analyze the identified concerns to determine if there will be a
significant impact on the environment; and document the determination, in writing,
showing why the environmental concerns will not be significant. A model negative
declaration form can be found as Appendix F of Part 617.
(2) The lead agency must maintain a file, readily accessible to the public, containing the
EAF and the negative declaration. For a Type I action, the lead agency must
additionally comply with filing and notice requirements described in Section 617.10.
D. Positive declaration. If the lead agency determines, after review of the EAF, that the
proposed action has the potential for a significant impact on the environment or community
character, it shall prepare and file a notice of positive declaration and may require the
preparation of a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) that includes information
specified in Section 617.14. A model positive declaration form can be found as Appendix E
of Part 617.
E. The applicant has the right to prepare the draft EIS. If the applicant refuses to prepare the
draft EIS, the lead agency has the option of preparing the draft EIS for the applicant or
tabling the proposed action for lack of a complete application. If the lead agency decides to
prepare the draft EIS, it may hire a consultant and charge the applicant a fee to recover the
direct costs of preparation.
221: 68
OGDENSBURG CODE
§ 221-63. Acceptance of draft environmental impact statement.
After receiving a draft EIS, the lead agency has 30 days to determine whether the document is
adequate for public review in terms of scope and content as described in Section 617.14. If the
lead agency decides that the draft EIS is not adequate, it shall return the document to the
applicant with a written identification of the deficiencies. If the lead agency determines that the
draft EIS is adequate, it shall issue a notice of completion of a draft EIS and file it as prescribed
in Section 617.10. A sample notice of completion of a draft EIS form is included as Appendix G
of Part 617.
§ 221-64. Public comment period.
The notice of completion of a draft EIS starts the public comment period that must be a
minimum of 30 days, during which all concerned parties are encouraged to offer their comments
to the lead agency. The public comment period must continue at least 10 days following a public
hearing, if one is held.
§ 221-65. Public hearing.
When the lead agency accepts the draft EIS, it must decide whether to hold a public hearing or
not. If a hearing is held, the lead agency must comply with notice and filing requirements
identified in Section 617.10. A hearing must provide at least 14 days of public notice and must
start within 60 days from the date of filing the notice of completion of the draft EIS.
§ 221-66. Preparation of final environmental impact statement.
The lead agency is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the final EIS regardless of who
prepares it. The final EIS shall be prepared within 45 calendar days after the close of any public
hearing or within 60 days after the filing of the draft EIS, whichever occurs last. The EIS shall
consist of:
A. The draft EIS, including any revisions or supplements of it;
B. Copies or a summary of the substantive comments received and their sources; and
C. The lead agency's response to the comments.
§ 221-67. Notice of completion of final environmental impact statement.
Upon completion or receipt of the final EIS the notice of completion of the final EIS shall be
prepared and filed as described in Section 617.10. A sample notice of a completion of the final
EIS form is included as Appendix H of Part 617.
§ 221-68. Findings statement.
All involved agencies shall prepare their own SEQR findings statement after the final EIS has
been filed and before the agency makes a decision. The lead agency shall prepare its findings
statement within 10 to 30 days following the filing of the notice of completion of the final EIS.
The findings statement should discuss the balance of environmental impacts versus the needs and
221: 69
ZONING
benefits of the proposed action.
A. Positive findings statement. A positive findings statement means that the lead agency has
determined that the proposed action is approvable after consideration of the final EIS and
demonstrates that the action chosen is one that minimizes or avoids environmental impacts
to the maximum extent practicable in terms of location, layout and design, scale or
magnitude, timing and use.
B. Negative findings statement. If the action is not approvable, the lead agency shall make a
negative findings statement documenting the reasons for the denial. A sample findings
statement form may be found as Appendix I of Part 617. Findings of each agency must be
filed with all other involved agencies and the applicant.
ARTICLE XVI
Site Plan Review
§ 221-69. Legislative authority.
Pursuant to authority delegated by § 30-a of the General City Law of the State of New York, the
Ogdensburg City Council hereby authorizes the City Planning Board to review and approve site
development plans. In all cases where this chapter requires site plan review by the Planning
Board, no building permit shall be issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer except upon
authorization of and in conformity with the final site plan approved by the Planning Board. Site
plan review by the Planning Board shall be required in all districts for the erection or
enlargement of all principal buildings other than one- or two-family dwellings and their
accessory uses or structures, except as otherwise described in
§ 221-70. Purpose.
This section of this chapter is enacted under the authority of § 30-a of the New York State
General City Law to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of the City.
The site plan review regulates the development of structures and sites in a manner which
considers the following concerns and, where necessary, requires modification of development
proposals to eliminate or minimize potential problems and nuisances. The principal areas of
concern are:
A. The balancing of landowners' rights to use their land with the corresponding rights of
neighboring landowners to live without undue disturbances from nuisances in the form of
noise, smoke, fumes, vibration, dust, odor, glare and stormwater runoff.
B. The safety and convenience of vehicular and pedestrian movement within the site, and in
relation to adjacent areas or roads.
C. The protection of state or local designated historical or archeological sites and natural
environmental resources on the site under review, and in adjacent areas.
D. The use shall be of such location, size and character that it will be in harmony with the
appropriate and orderly development of the City and will not be detrimental to the orderly
development of adjacent areas.
221: 70
OGDENSBURG CODE
§ 221-71. Sketch plan conference.
An optional sketch plan conference may be held between the Planning Board staff and the
applicant prior to the preparation and submission of a formal site plan. The intent of such a
conference is to enable the applicant to inform the Planning Board of the development proposal
prior to the preparation of a preliminary site plan, and for the Planning Board to review the basic
site design concept, advise the applicant as to potential problems and concerns, and to generally
determine the information to be required on the site plan. In order to accomplish these objectives,
the applicant should provide the following:
A. A statement and rough sketch showing the locations and dimensions of existing and
proposed structures, wells, waste disposal systems, parking areas, access drives, signage
and anticipated changes in the existing topography and natural features.
B. A sketch or map of the area which clearly shows the location of the site and nearby
properties, land uses, street rights-of-way, easements and other pertinent features.
§ 221-72. Applications for site plan approval.
An application for site development plan approval or for an amendment to a previously approved
site development plan shall be made in writing to the Chairperson of the Planning Board at least
15 days in advance of the Planning Board meeting at which the application is to be presented. All
drawings submitted must be at a scale of not more than 50 feet to the inch. Five copies of all

§ 221-73. Application acceptance; referral to Planning Board.
A. The Planning Board staff shall determine the completeness of any application made for site
plan review and shall notify the applicant within 10 days of the date of application
submission if such application is incomplete or deficient in any way, and shall further
specify the deficiencies.
B. The Planning Board staff shall certify on each site plan whether or not the plan meets the
requirements of all zoning regulations other than those of this section regarding site plan
review.
C. The Planning Board staff shall refer the application to the Planning Board in accordance
with submission and review timelines to determine whether the application is complete and
which information may be waived. Staff shall further recommend to approve, approve with
modifications or deny the preliminary site plan.
§ 221-74. Public hearing.
The Planning Board may schedule and hold a public hearing on the site plan if considered
desirable by a majority of its members. Such hearing shall be held within 45 days of the receipt
of a complete application submission or completion of the SEQR review and shall be advertised
in the City's official newspaper at least five days before the public hearing.
§ 221-75. Referral to County Planning Board.
A. The approval of a proposed site plan constitutes a special authorization within this chapter.
The application is, therefore, subject to referral by the City to the County Planning Board in
accordance with the requirements of § 239-m of the General Municipal Law, prior to final
action. Referral is necessary should the property of the site plan be located within 500 feet
of the following:
(1) The boundary of any City or town.
(2) The boundary of any state park or other recreation area.
(3) The right-of-way of any county or state parkway, throughway, expressway or other
controlled access highway.
(4) The right-of-way of any stream or drainage channel owned by the county or for
which the county has established channel lines.
(5) The boundary of any county- or state-owned land on which a public building or

Planning Board may proceed as if the County Planning Board had approved the referral.
§ 221-76. Planning Board decisions.
A. The Planning Board shall render its decision within 45 days following receipt of a complete
application for site plan review or, if a public hearing is held, within 45 days from the time
of the hearing. The Planning Board's final action, rendered in writing, shall consist of
either:

ZONING
(1) Approval of the site plan based upon a determination that the proposed plan will
constitute a suitable development and is in compliance with the standards set forth in
this section;
(2) Disapproval of the site plan based upon a determination that the proposed project
does not meet the standards for review set forth in this section, and stating such
deficiencies; or
(3) Approval of the site plan subject to any conditions, modifications and restrictions as
required by the Board which will ensure the project meets the standards for review.
B. Notice of the Board's decision shall be given in writing to the applicant and Code
Enforcement Officer. [Amended 10-22-2007 by Ord. No. 10-2007]
(1) Upon approval of the site plan and payment by the applicant of any and all fees due
to the City, the Planning Board shall endorse its approval by having the acting
Chairperson sign the final site plan and forward copies to the applicant and Code
Enforcement Officer.
(2) Upon disapproval of the site plan, the Planning Board shall so inform the Code
Enforcement Officer, and the Code Enforcement Officer shall deny a building permit
to the applicant. The Planning Board shall also notify the applicant in writing of its
decision and its reasons for disapproval.
C. Failure of the Planning Board to take final action within the specified time period shall be
deemed approval. The time within which a decision must be rendered may be extended by
mutual consent of the applicant and the Planning Board.
§ 221-77. Standards for review.
The Planning Board's review of the site plan shall include, as appropriate, but is not limited to,
the following general considerations:
A. Legal. The proposal shall conform to all provisions of this chapter and applicable
regulations of state agencies. All existing zoning violations on the site shall be corrected.
B. Traffic. The proposal shall provide safe and convenient movement of vehicular and
pedestrian traffic within the site and in relationship to adjoining roads, driveways and
properties. Furthermore, all proposed traffic access and driveways shall be adequate but not
excessive in size; adequate in width, grade, alignment and visibility; not located too near
street corners; and other similar safety considerations.
C. Parking and loading. Adequate off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided
consistent with § 221-41, Off-street parking and loading, for the proposed use to prevent
safety hazards from parking on public streets or disrupting traffic flow on adjacent roads,
and that the interior vehicle circulation system is adequate to provide safe accessibility to
all required off-street parking areas.
D. City services. The proposal shall not place unreasonable demands on City services and
facilities (e.g., fire protection, public roads, road maintenance and snow plowing,
recreational facilities, sewage system, water supply, etc.).
221: 74
OGDENSBURG CODE
E. Drainage. The proposal shall provide adequately for stormwater and drainage facilities such
that site runoff will not run into the sewage system, onto roads or cause nuisance conditions
for neighbors or lead to ponding or excessive erosion.
F. Exterior lighting. The location, direction, power and time of use for any proposed lighting
shall be designed to protect neighbors from undue disturbances and nuisances.
G. Pedestrian circulation. The proposal shall provide safe and convenient pedestrian
movement both within the site and to and from the site in a manner separated from
vehicular traffic.
H. Environmental and historic resources.
(1) Environmental resources and state-designated historic features on the site or adjacent

22-2007 by Ord. No. 10-2007]
(6) Expiration of variance. Unless construction is commenced and diligently pursued
within six months of the date of granting a variance, such variance shall become null
and void unless, upon application and receipt, an extension is granted by the ZBA.
(7) Appeal from decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any
decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may apply to the Supreme Court for relief
under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. Such proceeding must be
instituted within 30 days after the filing of a decision in the office of the CityClerk.
E. Powers and duties. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have all the powers and duties
prescribed by law and this chapter. In particular, the powers of the ZBA are:
(1) Interpretation: To decide any question involving the interpretation of any provision of
this chapter, including determination of the exact location of any zoning district
boundary or any other determination made in the application and administration of
this chapter. Such interpretation shall be considered and rendered by the Board only
221: 86
OGDENSBURG CODE
upon application or appeal following a determination made by the Director of
Planning and Development or the Code Enforcement Officer, unless requested by an
officer of the City or the Planning Board. [Amended 10-22-2007 by Ord. No. 10-
2007]
(2) Variances.
(a) Variances may be granted to modify or vary the strict application of any of the
requirements of this chapter so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed,
public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done where strict
application would result in a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship that
would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land or building involved.
The unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty must relate to the land, not the
applicant, as all variances run with the land. A hardship or difficulty which is
merely personal to the current owner of real property will not justify the
granting of a variance which runs with the land. Variances granted are subject to
site plan review according to Article XV.
(b) Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated: [Amended 1-23-1995 by Ord. No. 1-1995]
USE VARIANCE -- The authorization by the Zoning Board of Appeals for the
use of land for a purpose which is otherwise not allowed or is prohibited by the
applicable zoning regulations.
AREA VARIANCE -- The authorization by the Zoning Board of Appeals for
the use of land in manner which is not allowed by the dimensional or physical
requirements of the applicable zoning regulations, such as minimum lot size,
minimum lot width, minimum setbacks, off-street parking requirements or sign
limitations.
§ 221-84. Standards for granting variances. [Amended 1-23-1995 by Ord. No. 1-1995]
Following are the standards for granting use and area variances based upon New York State case
law through 1993:
A. Use variance standards. To grant approval for a use variance request, the applicant must
show that an unnecessary hardship exists with using the property in strict compliance with
this chapter. No such use variance shall be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals without
a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning regulations and restrictions have caused
unnecessary hardship. In determining whether an unnecessary hardship exists, the ZBA's
findings must establish that each and every of the following tests is met:
(1) Reasonable return. The applicant must demonstrate an inability to realize a
reasonable return under any of the uses permitted by this chapter. There must be
dollars-and-cents proof of the property's inability to earn a reasonable return; failure
to realize the highest return is not considered a hardship. Proof required to show
dollars-and-cents proof is not met by a simple statement by the applicant, or on the
part of a realtor, that the land will not at this time attract a buyer or developer for a
purpose consistent with this chapter. The New York Court of Appeals has stated that
221: 87
ZONING
dollars-and-cents proof may be shown by the following items:
(a) The amount paid for the parcel of land in question;
(b) The current value of the parcel;
(c) The maintenance expenses;
(d) The amount of taxes on the land;
(e) The amount of mortgages and other encumbrances, such as liens on the
property;
(f) Income from the land; and
(g) Other facts relevant to the particular circumstances of the case.
(2) Uniqueness. The hardship is unique to this parcel and is not general throughout the
zoning district. The applicant must prove that there are certain features or conditions
of the parcel that make it possible to earn a reasonable return without some
adjustment of the zoning regulations as they apply to the applicant's property. If
features or conditions are generally applicable throughout the district, a variance
should not be granted. If the hardship is common throughout the area, relief should be
accomplished by amendment to this chapter rather than by granting a variance.
(3) Character. The applicant must prove that the requested modification will not change
the character or quality of the neighborhood. In addition, the spirit of this chapter
should be preserved. Reviewing the purpose statements of the zoning district for
consistency with the proposed use is one way to determine whether the character of
the neighborhood is preserved and the spirit of this chapter is upheld.
(4) Self-created hardship. If the hardship complained of is self-imposed, then the
variance request may be denied. An applicant who acquires land or proposes to
acquire land for a purpose known to be prohibited by this chapter creates his or her
own hardship. Even if the applicant did not actually learn of the prohibition at the
time of purchase he or she is nevertheless charged with knowing the restrictions on
use.
(5) Other factors to be considered.
(a) Personal problems. If the hardship complained of is due to personal problems, as
opposed to use of the land or buildings, then the use variance must be denied.
Zoning and variances run with the land, not the owner.
B. The Zoning Board of Appeals, in granting of use variances, shall grant the minimum
variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate to address the unnecessary hardship
proven by the applicant, and at the same time preserve and protect the character of the
neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
C. Area variance standards. In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
221: 88
OGDENSBURG CODE
take into consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted, as weighted
against the detriment to the health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood or community
by such grant. In making such determination the Board shall consider:
(1) Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the character of the neighborhood
or a detriment to nearby properties will be created by the granting of the area
variance.
(2) Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some method feasible
for the application to pursue, other than an area variance.
(3) Whether the requested area variance is substantial.
(4) Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on the physical
or environmental conditions in the neighborhood or district.
(5) Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which consideration shall be relevant
to the decision of the Board of Appeals, but shall not necessarily preclude the
granting of the area variance.
D. The Zoning Board of Appeals, in granting of area variances, shall grant the minimum
variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate and at the same time preserve and
protect the character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the
community.
E. Following are some of the public purposes:
(1) Protect the health and safety of residents.
(2) Secure safety from the spread of fire and provide access for emergency equipment.
(3) Protect the rights of landowners and residents to adequate light, air and sunshine.
(4) Prevent the overcrowding of land and capacity of the streets.
(5) Protect the value of property by prohibiting the intrusion of inappropriate large,
overshadowing structures.
(6) Uphold the prevailing community character and form of the neighborhood.
(7) Protect adjacent properties from detrimental impacts.
(8) Reserve unbuilt areas for street widening.
F. Imposition of conditions. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall, in the granting of both use
variances and area variances, have the authority to impose such reasonable conditions and
restrictions as are directly related to and incidental to the proposed use of the property.
Such conditions shall be consistent with the spirit and intent of the Zoning Ordinance and
shall be imposed for the purpose of minimizing any adverse impact such variance may have
on the neighborhood or community.

Adult Entertainment Uses [Added 5-11-1998 by Ord. No. 5-1998]
§ 221-104. Purpose.
It is recognized that buildings and establishments operated as adult entertainment uses have
serious objectionable operational characteristics which may result in the blighting and
deterioration of areas surrounding them and the City itself. In order to promote the health,
welfare and well-being of the residents of the City of Ogdensburg, this section is intended to
restrict adult uses to nonresidential and nonbusiness areas of the City. The City Council hereby
finds that the operational characteristics of adult entertainment uses increase the detrimental
impact on a community when such uses are concentrated. Therefore, this section is intended to
promote the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the City of Ogdensburg by
regulating the concentration of such uses.
§ 221-105. Definitions.

NOTES:
* One side yard may be reduced down to zero feet if structures constructed within four feet of a side lot line have no windows, doors, air-conditioning units or other type of openings in the wall facing such side lot line. Swimming Pools shall be
located no less than four feet from a side lot line. In cases where the provided side yard is less than four feet, a written agreement between adjacent landowners shall be required for a perpetual maintenance easement of the lot line wall that allows
a minimum four-foot width for the entire length of the building.
** A buffer strip 25 feet in width shall be required along a zoning district boundaries and any existing one- or two-family dwelling when topographical, existing vegetation or other barriers do not provide reasonable screening to shield
neighboring properties. Buffering shall provide a year-round visual screen in order to minimize adverse impacts. It may consist of fencing, evergreens, berms, rocks, boulders, mounds or combinations of these to achieve the same objective. Plant
materials shall be sufficiently large and planted in such a fashion that a year-round screen at least seven feet in height shall be produced within three growing seasons.
*** Lot coverage is that portion of the lot that is covered by buildings, structures and accessory structures. Adequate parking and any front yard requirements must also be satisfied. See definitions of the following terms in § 221-6: “building,”
“accessory structure” and “structure.” See also § 221-37, Accessory uses and structures, and § 221-41, Off-street parking and loading.
**** Handicap ramps shall be exempt from minimum yard setbacks in all districts and shall fully comply with state and federal construction standards. [Added 3-27-1995 by Ord. No. 4-1995]
