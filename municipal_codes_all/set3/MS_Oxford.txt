PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Oxford, Mississippi. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1968 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of aldermen. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1968 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel Walker, Code Attorney, and Shelly Hayes, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Lisa Carwyle, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

If the position expiring in the spring is already an appointed position, it shall remain an appointed position. In this case, as there will continue to be two elected individuals to the board of trustees, a determination must be made again by the following November 1 as to whether the number of students attending the school district from outside the corporate limits is still less than 30 percent of the total number of students, and, in this case, if the position expiring the following spring is an elected position, it shall change to an appointed position and shall be an individual residing inside the corporate limits of the city. However, if by the following November 1 the number of students residing outside the corporate limits has again reached or exceeded 30 percent of the total number of students, then the elected position expiring the following spring shall remain an elected position and shall be an individual residing inside the corporate limits.

In addition to complying with all applicable chapters pertaining to on-premises retailers, no person may possess any beer, light wine, or alcoholic beverage in an open container, upon the premises permitted under this section (including the land, buildings, parking lot or other improvement under the possession or control of the property owner) except during the hours that establishments with on-premises retailer's permits are allowed to sell beer, light wine, or alcoholic beverages. Outside of the hours that establishments with on-premises retailer's permits are allowed to sell beer, light wine, or alcoholic beverages, no open container may be stored upon premises permitted under this section unless the open container is the personal property of the property owner and its contents not for consumption by the lessee or by the lessee's guests. When property is permitted for an event under this section, the city may hold either the property owner and/or the lessee liable for a violation of this chapter and/or for a violation of any state law or local code governing the operation of an establishment which has an on-premises retailer's permit issued by the alcohol beverage control division.

ARTICLE III. - KEG REGISTRATION 

Sec. 14-84. - Title. 
    This article shall be known and may be cited as the city keg registration article. 
(Ord. No. 2007-7, § 1(5-40), 4-17-2007) 
Sec. 14-85. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Keg means any container capable of holding four or more gallons of beer or light wine and which is designed to dispense beer or light wine directly from the container for purposes of consumption. 
    Possession of a keg means any individual who owns or leases real property or a vehicle in or on which a keg is located, who knows of its presence or has physical control over the keg, who shall be considered in possession of the keg for purposes of this article. 
    Possessor's permit mean a permit to be obtained from the city clerk by any person in order to be permitted to purchase or possess a keg pursuant to this article. 
    Registration seal means any document, stamp, declaration, seal, decal, sticker or device approved by the city clerk, designed to be affixed to kegs and displaying a registration number and such other information as may be prescribed by the city clerk. 
    Seller's permit means a permit to be obtained from the city clerk by any person or business entity in order to be permitted to sell kegs pursuant to the requirements of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2007-7, § 1(5-41), 4-17-2007) 
Sec. 14-86. - Purpose. 
    The identification of purchasers, possessors, or providers of kegs for consumption by underage or intoxicated persons is a major law enforcement, public health and safety concern in the city. When kegs are found where underage persons are present or intoxicated persons have been served, it is necessary to readily identify those responsible for making alcohol available or serving from such kegs. The investigation of crimes involving the furnishing of beer and light wine to minors, and related crimes involving kegs, is inhibited by the inability to identify the purchaser, possessor, or seller of the keg. Individual identification number, purchaser identity information, and retail seller identity information shall enable law enforcement to identify providers of keg alcoholic beverages to underage or intoxicated persons. It is in the public interest to place reasonable keg registration and identification requirement as set forth in this article. 
(Ord. No. 2007-7, § 1(5-42), 4-17-2007) 
Sec. 14-87. - Requirements for seller's permit. 
    The board of aldermen, through its designated representative, may grant to any person holding a privilege license issued by the city to sell beer and light wine at retail for off-premises consumption, a permit to sell beer and light wine in kegs for off-premises consumption. Applications for such permits shall be approved by the board of aldermen and made available by the city clerk. Permits are subject to suspension or revocation under this article.

(4)  The particular address or location where the keg will be consumed, and the date or dates on which it will be consumed. 
(b)  Limitations. All possessor's permits authorized under this section shall be subject to the following limitations:

(2)  No more than one keg may be possessed within any dwelling unit, lodginghouse, or other location not separately licensed to allow sale or distribution of beer and light wine, located within the city limits. No resident shall possess or allow any other person to possess a keg contrary to this subsection. 
(3)  No application shall be approved by the city clerk without the applicant first providing, on a form to be obtained by the clerk, written authorization from the owner of the premises where the applicant will possess the keg. 
(c)  Falsification. Falsifying any information requested on the application shall constitute a violation of this article. All possessor's permit applications approved by the city clerk shall be issued in triplicate, each copy bearing the official seal clerk, with one original to be maintained by the city clerk, one original to be maintained by the applicant, and one original to be maintained by the seller at the point of sale. 
(d)  Return of permit. Prior to the issuance of any subsequent possessor's permit, the preceding possessor's permit issued must be returned to the office of the city clerk or, in the alternative, a minimum of 30 days will have elapsed since the date of issuance of the previous possessor's permit. 
(Ord. No. 2007-7, § 1(5-44), 4-17-2007) 
Sec. 14-89. - Requirement of seller's permit, possessor's permit, deposit, log, and registration seal for sale of keg.

(Ord. No. 2007-7, § 1(5-46), 4-17-2007) 
Sec. 14-91. - Responsibilities associated with keg registration seal. 
(a)  The keg registration seal affixed to the keg may serve as the purchaser's receipt.

Kegs made of disposable packaging do not have to be returned to the retail licensee. The retailer shall indicate on the possessor's permit that the keg was not returnable due to its disposable packaging. 
(b)  For the purpose of tracing the kegs and purchaser responsibility, it shall be the responsibility of the seller to affix the properly completed and signed keg registration seal to the keg prior to the keg leaving control of the seller. 
(c)  Except in accordance with this section, no persons shall remove, alter, deface, or obliterate the registration seal affixed the keg. Throwing away empty kegs made of disposable packaging shall not constitute obliterate of the registration seal.

(b)  Lawful seizure of animals. All courts in the state may order the seizure of an animal by a law enforcement agency, for its care and protection upon a finding of probable cause to believe said animal is being cruelly treated, neglected or abandoned. Such probable cause may be established upon sworn testimony of any person who has witnessed the condition of said animal. 
(c)  Appointment of temporary custody of seized animals. The court may appoint the city animal shelter, a veterinarian, or other person as temporary custodian for the animal, pending final disposition of the animal pursuant to this section. Such temporary custodian shall directly contract and be responsible for any care rendered to such animal, and may make arrangements for such care as may be necessary. 
(d)  Serving notice upon the owner of a seized animal. Upon seizure of an animal, the law enforcement agency responsible for removal of the animal shall serve notice upon the owner of the animal, if possible, and shall also post prominently a notice to the owner or custodian to inform such person that the animal has been seized.

(4)  Failure to post such bond within three days shall result in forfeiture of the animal to the court. If the temporary custodian has custody of the animal upon the expiration of the bond or security, the animal shall be forfeited to the court unless the court orders otherwise. 
(5)  In determining the owner's fitness to have custody of an animal, the court may consider, among other matters: 
a.  Testimony from law enforcement officers, animal control officers, animal protection officials, and other witnesses as to the condition the animal was kept in by its owner or custodian. 
b.  Testimony and evidence as to the type and amount of care provided to the animal by its owner or custodian.

A lien for authorized expenses is hereby created upon all animals seized under this section, and shall have priority to any other lien on such animal. 
(7)  If the court finds the owner of the animal is unable or unfit to adequately provide for the animal, or that the animal is severely injured, diseased, or suffering, and therefore, not likely to recover, the court may order that the animal be permanently forfeited and released to city animal shelter, or other appropriate entity to be euthanized or the court may order that such animal be sold at public sale in the manner now provided for judicial sales; any proceeds from such sale shall go first toward the payment of expenses and costs relating to the care and treatment of such animal, and any excess amount shall be paid to the owner of the animal. 
(8)  Upon notice and hearing as provided in this section, or as a part of any proceeding conducted under the terms of this section, the court may order that other animals in the custody of the owner that were not seized be surrendered and further enjoin the owner from having custody of other animals in the future. 
(9)  If the court determines that the owner is able to provide adequately for, and have custody of, the animal, the court shall order the animal be claimed and removed by the owner within seven days after the date of the order. 
(10)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent or otherwise interfere with a law enforcement officer's authority to seize an animal as evidence or require court action for the taking into custody and making proper disposition of animals as authorized in MCA 1972, §§ 21-19-9 and 41-53-11. 
(g)  Cost and expenses incurred.

(Ord. No. 2008-1, § 1, 1-2-2008; Ord. No. 2017-1, § I, 1-17-2017) 
Sec. 34-32. - Tree preservation and protection. 
(a)  Principles. This section shall be enforced according to the following principles: 
(1)  Preservation of existing trees shall be the first, best, and standard approach. 
(2)  If preservation cannot be achieved, on-site mitigation shall next be pursued. 
(3)  If neither of the above approaches can be achieved, payment shall be made to the tree escrow account. 
(b)  Tree preservation criteria. The planning director shall consider the following factors, and any other relevant information, when evaluating tree preservation as shown on the landscape plan: 
(1)  The desirability of preserving a tree or group of trees by reason of age, location, size, or species. 
(2)  Whether the size or shape of the lot reduces the flexibility of the design. 
(3)  The general health and condition of the tree or group of trees, or the presence of any disease, injury, or hazard. 
(4)  The placement of the tree or group of trees in relation to utilities, structures, and the use of the property. 
(5)  The need to remove the tree or group of trees for the purpose of installing, repairing, replacing, or maintaining essential public utilities. 
(6)  Whether roads, utilities and building footprint are designed in relation to the existing topography, and located, where possible, to avoid damage to existing tree canopy. 
(7)  Construction requirements of on-site and off-site drainage. 
(8)  The extent to which development of the site and the enforcement of this article are impacted by state and federal regulations. 
(c)  Tree preservation requirements. The intent is to leave undisturbed as many existing significant, specimen and heritage trees as possible. Further, the number of trees required for mitigation shall be based upon the existing significant and heritage trees to be removed. An inventory of existing trees on the site (as required in section 34-24) must be completed under the following guidelines: 
    On development sites of less than ten acres, an inventory of the entire site is required. On sites of more than ten acres, 25 percent of the site or a minimum of ten acres (whichever is greater) must be surveyed. A determination of the total number of trees (significant, specimen, and heritage) on the site will be derived from a multiple of the trees varieties found in the survey area applied to the entire site. 
    For the representative sampling method on larger sites, the developer must provide a recently dated aerial photo of the site (within the past three months) so that the planning director (or a designee) can select the appropriate area or areas for conducting the inventory. The inventory of the selected area or areas must be conducted by a licensed arborist and submitted to the planning director. 
(1)  For each existing significant tree removed, the rate of mitigation is as follows: 
a.  Replacement trees shall be planted at rate of one, two-inch caliper tree per five inches of trees removed, measured at DBH. 
b.  In the Old Town Conservation Overlay District and on sites greater than five acres, replacement of heritage trees shall be planted at rate of one, two-inch caliper tree per two inches of trees removed, measured at DBH. 
(2)  For each existing significant, specimen and/or heritage tree retained, the following credits shall be available: 
a.  For each significant and/or specimen trees retained, extra credit shall be available for one, two-inch caliper tree equal to the total DBH of all significant and/or specimen trees retained divided by the rate of mitigation of five inches. 
b.  For each tree grove retained, extra credit shall be available for one, two-inch caliper tree equal to the total DBH of all significant and/or specimen trees retained within a tree grove divided by the rate of mitigation of five inches. 
c.  In the Old Town Conservation Overlay District and on sites greater than five acres, for each heritage tree retained, extra credit shall be available for one, two-inch caliper tree equal to the total DBH of all heritage trees retained divided by the rate of mitigation of one inch. 
(3)  The planning director may approve the use of trees less than two-inch caliper for the planting of medium tree species (dogwoods and red buds) and/or greater than two-inch caliper on an equal total caliper basis, e.g. two, three-inch caliper trees equals three, two-inch caliper trees. 
(4)  Each development will have a ten percent credit applied before any mitigation is required. For example, if there were 1,000 inches DBH of existing trees, 100 inches could be removed without mitigation. 
(5)  Trees in poor health and/or hazard trees will not require mitigation if the condition is so determined by a designated city official, and in the event of a dispute, an International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) certified arborist will make a determination at the expense of the developer. 
(6)  Except for heritage trees in the Old Town Conservation Overlay District or on sites greater than five acres, existing significant trees located within a building footprint, street, driveway, sidewalk, pathway or utility easement shall not require mitigation. 
(d)  Tree escrow account. Any applicant unable to achieve on-site mitigation shall make a payment to the City of Oxford's Tree Escrow Account for each tree required to meet the mitigation requirements set forth above. The amount of money to be paid shall be based on the fair market value of materials and labor at the time of planting as determined by the planning director based on standard costs incurred by the city, estimated annually. The applicant shall submit cost estimates to the planning director for approval. 
(1)  Money contributed in lieu of on-site mitigation shall be paid prior to issuance of a building permit and/or prior to final plat approval by the board of aldermen for all residential and nonresidential subdivisions. 
(2)  Money contributed under this section: 
a.  May be used for tree canopy management, replacement, and preservation including, but not limited to, tree acquisition and planting; canopy replacement site identification, acquisition, and preparation; tree acquisition, planting, and maintenance of trees on designated city property utilizing either city staff or contract labor; acquisition of parkland areas that enhance and preserve tree canopy; and 
b.  Shall not revert to the general fund for ongoing operations. 
(3)  In a development or subdivision where it is not possible or advisable to plant all required trees within the development or subdivision, the funds contributed to the tree escrow account may be used for any purposes noted in subsection 34-32(d)(2)a. above, with priority given to locations established in Oxford's Master Tree Plan and those on the annual prioritized projects list (noted in subsection (11) below) of the tree board, anywhere in the city limits. 
(4)  In a development or subdivision where it is not possible to plant all required trees within the development or subdivision, alternate planting locations will first be sought on appropriate sites within a one-mile radius of where the development is located. If this cannot be achieved, the funds shall be used on city property closest to the development, and if that cannot be achieved, for any purposes noted in subsection 34-32(d)(2)a. above anywhere in the city limits. The location of appropriate planting spaces is to be derived from Oxford's Master Tree Plan or as determined by the mayor and board of aldermen. 
(5)  The city shall refund the portion of the money contributed under this section, including the accrued interest that has not been expended seven years from the date of the contribution. Interest shall be based on the rate of return the city has experienced over the period. 
(6)  Refunds shall be paid to the applicant who made the original contribution. 
(7)  Notice of the right to a refund, including the amount of the refund and the procedure for applying for and receiving the refund, shall be sent or served in writing to the applicant no later than 30 days after the date which the refund becomes due. The sending by regular mail of the notices to the applicant shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirement of notice. 
(8)  The refund shall be made on a pro rata basis, and shall be paid in full no later than 90 days after the date certain upon which the refund becomes due. 
(9)  At the time of the contribution to the tree escrow account, the planning director shall provide the applicant with written notice of those circumstances under which refunds of such fees will be made. Failure to deliver such written notice shall not invalidate any contribution to the tree escrow account under this article. 
(10)  The tree escrow account shall be managed by the city clerk. The city clerk will consult with the planning director, the superintendent of buildings and grounds, and the Oxford Tree Board to ensure that all tree management and planting efforts undertaken by the city are fully coordinated. 
(11)  The tree board shall annually provide to the board of aldermen a prioritized projects list of preferred areas where tree escrow funds will be most effectively utilized derived from their knowledge of the city, recommendations from appropriate city staff and others. Specific recommendations for use of the funds shall be made to the tree board by members of the tree board, the planning director, the superintendent of building and grounds, the director of parks, and others. The planning director will present the prioritized project list from the tree board to the mayor and aldermen for final approval. 
(e)  Removal of trees without authorization. 
(1)  Trees removed from a site for timber harvesting do not need site plan approval. If trees are removed from a site for timber harvesting, no development may be proposed on the site for 36 months, except as noted below. Properties outside the city limits seeking use of city water and sewer are subject to the requirements of this article; and properties annexed into the city are subject to the requirements of this article for any trees cleared in the 12 months prior to annexation. 
(2)  Properties outside the city limits seeking use of city water and sewer are subject to the requirements of this article. 
(3)  Properties annexed into the city are subject to the requirements of this article for any trees cleared after the mayor and board of aldermen authorize the filing of a petition for annexation for an area containing the subject property or after a petition for inclusion is filed for the subject property. 
(4)  Removal of trees prior to site plan approval. If trees are removed from a property prior to approval of a site plan, then any development application for the site shall be denied or penalized as noted below. If a replanting plan is proposed, the square foot percentage of canopy area required shall be based on the total area of the property less the square footage dedicated to the building footprint, street, driveway, sidewalk, pathway or utility easement. 
a.  Prior removal of significant and/or specimen trees. If any significant or specimen trees (as defined in this article) are removed prior to obtaining site plan approval then any development application for the site shall be denied for up to 24 months from the date of the requested development application except as noted. 
A request for site plan approval within the 24-month time frame may be considered if the proposed site plan incorporates a replanting plan that results in a future canopy coverage of 40 percent of the site or the applicant agrees to contribute to the tree escrow account an amount equal to the cost of implementing the reforestation plan or a combination of both. Prior tree removal of heritage trees. If any heritage trees (as defined in this article) are removed prior to obtaining site plan approval, then any development application for the site shall be denied for up to 36 months from the date of the requested development application. 
A request for site plan approval within the 36-month time frame may be considered if the proposed site plan incorporates a replanting plan that results in a future canopy coverage of 40 percent of the site or the applicant agrees to contribute to the tree escrow account in an amount equal to the cost of implementing the replanting plan or a combination of both. A fine of $500.00 per acre of trees cleared and $1,000.00 per each heritage tree removed shall also be imposed. 
b.  Tree removal before tree survey is conducted. If any trees are removed from a site before a tree survey is prepared and provided to the planning director, then any development application for the site shall be denied for up to 36 months. 
A request for site plan approval within the 36-month time frame may be considered if the proposed site plan incorporates a replanting plan that results in a future canopy coverage of 40 percent of the site or the applicant agrees to contribute to the tree escrow account an amount equal to the cost of implementing the replanting plan or a combination of both. A fine of $1,000.00 per acre of trees cleared shall also be imposed. 
(f)  Placement of trees. The applicant is expected to plant trees in locations on the site where the environmental benefits of canopy cover are most likely to offset the impact of development. Trees shall not be placed within utility easements, or in other locations where their future protection cannot be assured. 
(g)  Tree protection. Trees identified on an approved site plan to be retained, shall utilize the following protection efforts: 
(1)  Install four-foot high perimeter fencing at the extreme outer edge of the dripline. Perimeter fencing located within 50 feet of any building footprint, unless approved by the planning director or the building official, shall be constructed of wood or metal materials. The fencing must carry durable signs designating the area as a "tree protection zone" and shall remain in place throughout the construction period. Such signs shall be placed around the perimeter of all tree protection zones with a maximum spacing of 25 feet and be a minimum of 80 square inches in size and shall be firmly affixed to the tree protection fence. There shall be no activity of any kind inside the perimeter other than hand-brush clearing. 
a.  No land clearing or building permits shall be issued until the perimeter of all protected trees and tree groves have been properly fenced. 
b.  Grates or other pervious surfaces shall be utilized within the dripline of existing trees to allow water and air to reach the tree roots. 
c.  Fill (or other soil disturbance) shall be prohibited, as well as any vehicle traffic or material storage in areas under the dripline of trees to be protected. 
d.  Drastic changes in drainage patterns which may negatively affect existing trees shall be avoided. 
e.  Any person who intentionally damages a protected tree shall be in violation of this article and subject to the penalties prescribed in section 34-36. 
f.  The removal of the protected fencing, or encroachment into the area, without explicit approval of the property owner or his designated agent, shall be punishable by a fine up to the replacement value of the tree(s) involved. Replacement value shall be determined by a method approved by the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA). This applies to any person or entity, public or private.

(a)  This article does not intend to create undue hardship on affected properties. 
(b)  Where there are unusual circumstances peculiar to the site being prepared for development and where a literal application of specific provisions of this article would unnecessarily restrict the development of a site and result in undue hardship to the owners or other interested persons, a variance from specific provisions of this article may be requested. The application requesting a variance from the requirements of this article shall include a description of the property, the exact nature of the proposed variance, and the grounds upon which it is requested. The applicant shall further demonstrate that the granting of such variance will not adversely affect the surrounding properties nor otherwise be detrimental to the public welfare. 
(c)  The application shall be filed with the planning director for the city. Upon receiving an application for a variance, in which all required information is supplied, the planning director shall make a recommendation within ten working days and forward said application to the board of adjustment for their consideration. Within ten working days after the board's receipt of a recommendation by the planning director, the board shall meet to consider said request. 
(d)  Within ten working days after the board's meeting, the board shall grant or deny said variance in whole or in part. If the board fails to take action on the request for the variance within the specified time period, such inaction shall be deemed to grant the variance. 
(e)  Every decision of said board shall be final, subject, however, to such remedy as any aggrieved party may have at law or in equity.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 38-1. - False fire alarms. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to willfully give or make, or cause to be given or made, a false alarm of fire within the city. 
(Code 1968, § 10-1) 
Sec. 38-2. - Smoking in shows, etc. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to smoke cigars, cigarettes, pipes, or any other smoking device in any theater, picture show, auditorium, church, or any other public gathering house or structure. 
(Code 1968, § 10-2) 
Sec. 38-3. - Open burn permits; penalties. 
(a)  Permits. To burn inside the city limits of Oxford, contact the Oxford Fire Department at (662) 232-2411. The City of Oxford requires 48-hour advance notice to schedule a permit inspection and the fee is $200.00. After obtaining the appropriate city permit, an inspection will then be scheduled to ensure opening burning permit requirements are met. 
    The permit is valid for ten days following the inspection. If weather conditions prohibit burning for a significant period during those ten days, a short extension may be granted, if requested in writing, before the expiration of the permit. 
    Only trees and brush from the burn site may be burned. Material may not be hauled in from other sites. Other materials including buildings, construction debris, furniture, plastic, synthetics, tires, and roofing material shall not be burned. 
    Open burning of land-clearing debris shall not use starter or auxiliary fuels which cause excessive smoke (rubber tires, plastics, etc.). Diesel fuel is acceptable as an ignition fuel. 
    No burning of any type shall take place during burn bans imposed by the Mississippi Department of Forestry or during Lafayette County imposed burn restrictions. 
(b)  Burn pit specifications. In the City of Oxford, an air curtain destructor (blower) shall be required to increase burning efficiency and reduce smoke and fly ash emissions. The air curtain's nozzles will be slanted so they impact about three feet below the surface on the side opposite the blower. The air curtain shall not blow directly down into the fire. In a properly operating pit, the air current will roll under and oxygenate the fire for more complete combustion. A burn pit shall be constructed for all open burning per the following specifications: The pit walls must be vertical (not sloped or slanted). The pit must be no more than 12 feet wide for the air stream to reach the far side. A pit width of less than 12 feet can be used for smaller air blowers, but only with an inspection and approval by the Oxford Fire Department. 
    The pit length is determined by the length of the air curtain plenum (blower manifold). The plenum shall be centered on the pit and the pit length will only extend up to a maximum of five feet beyond each end of the plenum. 
    The pit must be at least ten feet deep. Pit depth will be determined by available digging equipment and the water table. A pit cannot be permitted where groundwater is encountered during the construction. Deeper pits usually burn better. 
    Sufficient water supply and hose must be readily available and easily accessible to the area and location of the burn. The hose and appropriate nozzle shall be attached to the water supply source. Personnel must be at the site to monitor the pit when burning is taking place. 
    All Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) Air Pollution Control Section, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other applicable government guidelines shall be followed at all times during the burning process. 
(c)  Procedure for the scheduled inspection day. Prior to the scheduled inspection, a burn pit will be constructed according to the above permit requirements. The pit must be partially filled with trees and brush. The pit must not be overfilled as an overfilled pit will result in material being stacked above the sheet of air and/or blockage of the air flow which will cause excessive smoke emissions. 
    After the fire department inspector approves the pit's dimensions and position, diesel fuel may be used to ignite the contents. The equipment's ability to control smoke will be observed before the permit is issued. 
(d)  Procedure for burn days. During the permit period, the City of Oxford Fire Department must be notified each day before burning begins and again when burning ends for the day. The fire department telephone number is written at the bottom of the permit. 
    Burning should take place during daylight hours for fire safety and to protect workers charging the burn pit. A designated person must be at the site to monitor the pit when burning is taking place. Operation of the blower will continue until the fire has burned down completely and a fence or barrier will be placed completely around the pit or the pit itself completely filled and covered with dirt prior to leaving the site unless otherwise approved by the City of Oxford Fire Department. A metal fence is required for the prevention of mishaps such as falling into unfilled pits. A wooden fence is unacceptable. 
(e)  Problems encountered with burn pits. A permit is issued for a particular pit. If a pit is moved, another inspection, permit, and fee are required for the new pit, even if both pits are on the same construction site. 
    A pit too long for the air curtain or wider than the permit specifications shall be filled and replaced with another pit. 
    Burning must take place below the air curtain. Overfilled pits tend to smoke and release fly ash which are the most common citizen complaints. 
    Additional restrictions, such as limited burning hours and days or the presence of a water truck on-site may be imposed based on the site's location and distance to the nearest water hydrant. Wind speed and direction limitations may also be imposed, either at the time the permit is issued or as a result of citizen complaints. Weather conditions are available from the National Weather Service at (901) 544-0399. 
(f)  Enforcement of violations. Occasionally, a permit cannot be issued because of the small size of the site or the site's proximity to occupied residences, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, airports, or major roadways. The presence of overhanging trees or other flammable material may also prevent the issuance of a permit. No standing timber or overhead electrical lines are permitted within 100 feet of the burn pit. 
    Locations for pits shall be at least: 
  One hundred fifty feet away from the nearest structure on the property being cleared. 
  Five hundred feet away from any primary or secondary highway. 
  One thousand feet from any school or residence not on the same property as the pit. 
  One-half mile or 2,640 feet from any airport, nursing home or hospital. Burn sites shall not be adjacent or near proximity to fuel storage tanks, storage facilities containing flammable or explosive materials. 
  The proposed site must be free of thick or large areas of weeds, grass or other vegetation that might ignite and endanger lives of persons, animals or structures. 
    Anyone burning prohibited materials, burning without a permit or burning in a manner deemed non-compliant with the terms and conditions of a permit and this section shall be subject to any remedies, at law or in equity, available to the City of Oxford and any person aggrieved thereby, and may be subject to any of the following administrative actions: (1) cease and desist order, (2) permit revocation, and/or (3) a stop work order on all activities of the permit holder if there is an imminent threat to public safety. Permits may also occasionally be revoked because of substantiated complaints regarding excessive smoke or fly ash due to improper burn pit operation. As a result, burning is to be conducted when ambient conditions ensure maximum dispersion of smoke to minimize complaints. 
    Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with applicable permits, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each act of violation and each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the administrator of this section from taking such other lawful actions as are necessary to prevent or remedy any violation, including application of the administrative remedies stated herein. 
    The MDEQ is also authorized to fine violators of permit conditions up to a maximum of $25,000.00 per violation. 
    Burning shall not be conducted during any declared burn ban or air pollution episode in the area of the burn. 
    The following information must be provided when a controlled burn permit is issued: 
  Address of company or individual. 
  After-hours contact number for emergency use. 
  Location of burn site. 
  Name of company or individual conducting the burn. 
  Telephone number of operator. 
    Questions regarding opening burning should be directed to the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, North MS Field Services, 8 County Road 413, Oxford, MS 38655, phone (662) 234-3733 or to the Oxford Fire Department, 399 McElroy Drive, Oxford, MS 38655, phone (662) 232-2411.

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec 42-1. - Statutory authorization 
    The legislature of the state has in MCA 1972 tit. 17, ch. 1 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2010-10, § 1, 9-21-2010) 
Sec 42-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The city is subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions, both inside and outside the identified special flood hazard areas, causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 2010-10, § 1, 9-21-2010) 
Sec. 42-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage, and; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 2010-10, § 1, 9-21-2010) 
Sec. 42-4. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this chapter are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
(7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a floodprone area. 
(Ord. No. 2010-10, § 1, 9-21-2010) 
Sec. 42-5. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
(4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage, and; 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.

ARTICLE II. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 42-11. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its' most reasonable application. 
    A zone is the area of special flood hazard without base flood elevations determined. 
    A1 - A30 and AE zone is the area of special flood hazard with base flood elevations determined. 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure, which is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
    Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter or height of a building. Any addition shall be considered new construction. If the addition is more than 50 percent of the market value of the structure, then the addition and the existing structure are now new construction. 
    AH zone is an area of one percent chance of shallow flooding where depths are between one to three feet (usually shallow ponding), with base flood elevations shown. 
    AO zone is an area of one percent chance of shallow flooding where depths are between one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain), with depth numbers shown. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    AR/A1 - A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and AR/A zones are SFHAs that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system or levee that is in the process of being restored to provide a one percent chance or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete, these areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources. 
    A99 zone is that part of the SFHA inundated by the one percent chance flood to be protected from the one percent chance flood by a Federal flood protection system or levee under construction, no base flood elevations are determined. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. This area is also referred to as the special flood hazard area (SFHA). 
    B and X zones (shaded) are areas of two-tenths percent chance flood that are outside of the SFHA subject to the one percent chance flood with average depths of less than one foot, or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile, and areas protected by certified levees from the base flood. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "one percent chance flood"). 
    Base Flood Elevation (BFE) is the elevation shown in the flood insurance study (FIS) for zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, V1-V30, and VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means any portion of a building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or the supporting foundation system. This is associated with V zone construction. 
    Building. See Structure . 
    C and X zones (unshaded) are areas determined to be outside the two-tenths percent chance floodplain. 
    Coastal AE zone means the portion of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) landward of a velocity (V) zone or landward of an open coast or back-bay area without mapped V-zones, in which the principal sources of flooding are astronomical tides, storm surges, seiches or tsunamis; not riverine sources. Coastal AE zones may be subject to wave effects, velocity flows, erosion, scour or combinations of these forces. All community-identified portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) between the landward limit of the one and one-half-foot breaking wave and the V zone boundary shall be treated in a regulatory sense as V zones. Where no V zone is mapped in back-bay areas, the coastal AE zone is the portion between shore and the landward limit of the one and one-half-foot breaking wave. 
    Coastal barrier resources system (CBRS) is a system of protected coastal areas which also includes otherwise protected areas; subject to certain flood coverage restrictions. These areas were identified by the Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982 (CBRA) and the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 and are shown on appropriate FIRM panels. 
    Coastal high hazard area is an area of special flood hazard, extending from offshore to the inland limit of the primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. The area is designated on the FIRM as zone V1 - V30, VE or V.

    Community flood hazard area (CFHA) is an area that has been determined by the floodplain administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified community official) from available technical studies, historical information, and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. This includes areas downstream from dams. 
    Critical facility (also called critical action) means facilities for which the effects of even a slight chance of flooding would be too great. The minimum floodplain of concern for critical facilities is the two-tenths percent chance flood level. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to facilities critical to the health and safety of the public such as: Emergency operations centers, designated public shelters, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vital data storage centers, power generation and water and other utilities (including related infrastructure such as principal points of utility systems) and installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste (as defined under the Clean Water Act and other federal statutes and regulations). Such facilities and access to such facilities will be constructed outside the one percent chance special flood hazard area or elevated/protected to or above the 0.2 percent chance flood level. 
    D zone is an area in which the flood hazard is undetermined. 
    Dam is any artificial barrier, including appurtenant works, constructed to impound or divert water, waste water, liquid borne materials, or solids that may flow if saturated. All structures necessary to maintain the water level in an impoundment or to divert a stream from its course will be considered a dam. 
    Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, or storage of materials or equipment. 
    Dry floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damages to real estate or improved real estate property, water, and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. Structures shall be floodproofed with a minimum of 18 inches of freeboard in relation to the base flood elevation. Dry floodproofing of a pre-FIRM residential structure that has not been substantially damaged or improved is allowed. Dry floodproofing of a post-FIRM residential building is not allowed. Non-residential structures may be dry floodproofed in all flood zones with the exception of the coastal high hazard area or the coastal AE zone. 
    Elevated building means for insurance purposes, a non-basement building which has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, pilings, columns, or piers. 
    Elevation certificate is a FEMA form used as a certified statement that verifies a building's elevation information. 
    Emergency program means the first phase under which a community participates in the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance coverage for all insurable buildings in that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM. 
    Enclosure below the lowest floor. See Lowest floor . 
    Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
    Executive Order 11988 (floodplain management) this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative. 
    Existing construction means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. Existing construction may also be referred to as existing structures. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision includes the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Fill means a deposit of earthen materials placed by artificial means. 
    Five-hundred year flood means the flood that has a two-tenths percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the two-tenths percent chance flood have a moderate risk of flooding. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
(3)  Mudslides which are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
(4)  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding. 
    Flood (insurance definition) means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land areas or of two or more properties (e.g. a building and a public street) from: 
(1)  Overflow of inland or tidal waters; 
(2)  Unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters; 
(3)  Mudflows caused by flooding. 
    Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM) means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by FEMA, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been identified as zone A. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) is the document which provides an examination, evaluation, and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation, and determination of mudslide and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Flood protection elevation is the base flood elevation plus one foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator. 
    Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by flood waters from any source. 
    Floodplain administrator is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damages to real estate or improved real estate property, water, and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. Only non-residential buildings in A zones can be floodproofed. Structures shall be floodproofed with a minimum of one foot of freeboard in relation to the base flood elevation. 
    Floodproofing certificate is an official FEMA form used to certify compliance for non-residential structures in A zones as an alternative to elevating buildings to or above the base flood elevation. 
    Floodway. See Regulatory floodway . 
    Floodway fringe means that area of the special flood hazard area on either side of the regulatory floodway. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the base flood. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, ship building and ship repair facilities and seafood offloading facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, processing functions, sales, administrative functions, or service facilities. 
    Hardship (as related to variances of this chapter) means the exceptional difficulty that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Hazard potential means the possible adverse incremental consequences that result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or mis-operation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of a dam does not reflect in any way on the current condition of a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g. safety, structural integrity, and flood routing capacity). 
    High hazard dam means a class of dam in which failure may cause loss of life, serious damage to residential, industrial, or commercial buildings; or damage to, or disruption of, important public utilities or transportation facilities such as major highways or railroads. Dams which meet the statutory thresholds for regulation that are proposed for construction in established or proposed residential, commercial, or industrial areas will be assigned this classification, unless the applicant provides convincing evidence to the contrary. A development permit is required for a structure and any associated fill downstream from a dam at any location where flooding can be reasonably anticipated from principal or emergency spillway discharges, or from overtopping and failure of the dam. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a building. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on the state inventory of historic structures; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior. 
    Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analyses means the analyses performed by a professional engineer, registered in the state, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries. 
    Increased cost of compliance (ICC) coverage means under the standard flood insurance policy the cost to repair a substantially flood damaged building that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a substantially damaged building into compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are floodproofing (nonresidential), relocation, elevation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, include ICC coverage. 
    Letter of map change (LOMC) is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMC's are broken down into the following categories: Letter of map amendment (LOMA) - An amendment based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA, was not elevated by fill (only by a natural grade elevation), and will not be inundated by the one percent chance flood. A LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is not located in a SFHA. Letter of map revision (LOMR) - A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SFHA. Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) - A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, or flood insurance studies. 
    Levee means a manmade structure; usually an earthen embankment designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. For a levee system to be recognized, the following criteria must be met. All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage, whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised). All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or state agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP. 
    Limit of moderate wave action (LiMWA) is the limit of the AE zone category area exposed to wave attack from waves greater than one and one-half feet during the base (one percent chance) flood on open coastal and inland areas exposed to erosion and wave propagation. Base flood conditions between the VE zone and the LiMWA will be similar to, but less severe than those in the VE zone. 
    Low hazard dam means a class of dam in which failure would at the most result in damage to agricultural land, farm buildings (excluding residences), or minor roads. 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion of construction. It does not include earth that is placed for aesthetic or landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a building's foundation system. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the non-elevation provisions of this code. 
    Manufactured home (44 CFR 59.1 definition/FEMA) means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities.

    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Map amendment means a change to an effective NFIP map that results in the exclusion from the SFHA or an individual structure or a legally described parcel of land that has been inadvertently included in the SFHA (i.e., no alterations of topography have occurred since the date of the first NFIP map that showed the structure or parcel to be within the SFHA. 
    Map panel number means the four-digit number followed by a letter suffix assigned by FEMA on a FHBM, FBFM, or FIRM. The first four digits represent the map panel, and the letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised. 
    Market value means the property value (as agreed between a willing buyer and seller); excluding the value of land as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value); or adjusted assessed values.

    Non-residential means, but is not limited to; small business concerns, churches, schools, farm buildings (including grain bins and silos), poolhouses, clubhouses, recreational buildings, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial structures, warehouses, and hotels and motels with normal room rentals for less than 6 months duration. 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 means a vertical control, corrected in 1988, used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    Obstruction means, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channel construction, bridge, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    One percent flood (aka 100-Year Flood) is the flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A or V is subject to inundation by the one percent chance flood. Over the life of a 30-year loan, there is a 26 percent chance of experiencing such a flood within the SFHA. 
    Participating community is any community that voluntarily elects to participate in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations that are consistent with the standards of the NFIP.

    Regular program means the second phase of the community's participation in the NFIP in which second layer coverage is available based upon risk premium rates only after FEMA has competed a risk study for the community. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    Repair means the reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing building for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and all such regulations effective at the time of permitting must be met. 
    Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Repetitive loss property is any insurable building for which two or more claims of more than $1,000.00 were paid by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) within any rolling ten-year period, since 1978. At least two of the claims must be more than ten days apart but, within ten years of each other. A RL property may or may not be currently insured by the NFIP. 
    Section 1316 means that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that FEMA finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that are intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas. 
    Severe repetitive loss structure means any insured property that has met at least one of the following paid flood loss criteria since 1978, regardless of ownership: 
(1)  Four or more separate claim payments of more than $5,000.00 each (including building and contents payments); or 
(2)  Two or more separate claim payments (building payments only) where the total of the payments exceeds the current market value of the property. 
In either case, two of the claim payments must have occurred within ten years of each other. Multiple losses at the same location within ten days of each other are counted as one loss, with the payment amounts added together. 
    Significant hazard dam means a dam assigned the significant hazard potential classification where failure may cause damage to main roads, minor railroads, or cause interruption of use, or service of relatively important public utilities. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means that portion of the floodplain subject to inundation by the base flood and/or flood-related erosion hazards as shown on a FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AE, A1 - A30, AH, AO, AR, AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, V, VE, or V1-V30. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act P. L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

The term does not include recreational vehicle or a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in the last part of this definition, or a gas, or a liquid storage tank. Subrogation means an action brought by FEMA when flood damages have occurred, a flood insurance claim has been paid, and all or part of the damage can be attributed to acts or omissions by a community or other third party. 
    Subrogation means an action brought by FEMA when flood damages have occurred, a flood insurance claim has been paid, and all or part of the damage can be attributed to acts or omissions by a community or other third party. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. "Substantial damage" also means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of reconstruction, rehabilitation, or other improvement of a structure taking place during the life of the building, in which the cumulative percentage of improvement equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. The costs for determining substantial improvement include the costs of additions. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not apply to: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, provided that said code deficiencies were not caused by neglect or lack of maintenance on the part of the current or previous owners; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means manufactured home parks or subdivisions where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Suspension means the removal, with or without probation, of a participating community from the NFIP because the community failed to adopt and enforce the compliant floodplain management regulations required for participation in the NFIP. 
    V zone. See Coastal high hazard area. 
    V1 - V30 and VE zone . See Coastal high hazard area . 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    Watercourse means any flowing body of water including a river, creek, stream, or a branch. 
    Wet floodproofing means a method of construction which allows water to enter a structure in such a way that will minimize damage to the structure and its contents. Wet floodproofing is appropriate for functionally dependent use and uses that facilitate open space use by variance only, structures utilized for parking or limited storage, or when all other techniques are not technically feasible. Wet floodproofing shall not be utilized as a method to satisfy the requirements of this chapter for bringing substantially damaged or improved structures into compliance. Wet floodproofing is not allowed in lieu of complying with the lowest floor elevation requirements for new residential buildings. 
    X zone means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X shown on recent FIRMs (B on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with a two-tenths percent annual probability of being equaled or exceeded (aka 500-year flood). Unshaded X (C on older FIRMs) designates areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less than two-tenths percent. 
    Zone means a geographical area shown on a flood hazard boundary map or a flood insurance rate map that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area.

Sec. 42-31. - Enforcment, penalties and violations. 
    Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this chapter or permit shall be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in article III. Any such action or inaction that is continuous with respect to time is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of any of the penalties described below shall not prevent such equitable relief. 
(1)  Notice of Violation. If the community determines that an applicant or other responsible person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit, or the provisions of this chapter, it shall issue a written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible person. Where the person is engaged in activity covered by this ordinance without having first secured a permit, the notice shall be served on the owner or the responsible person in charge of the activity being conducted on the site. The notice of violation shall contain: 
a.  The name and address of the owner or the applicant or the responsible person; 
b.  The address or other description of the site upon which the violation is occurring; 
c.  A statement specifying the nature of the violation; 
d.  A description of the remedial measures necessary to bring the action or inaction into compliance with the permit or this chapter and the date for the completion of such remedial action;

(2)  Penalties. In the event the remedial measures described in the notice of violation have not been completed by the date set forth for such completion in the notice of violation, any one or more of the following actions or penalties may be assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation was directed. Before taking any of the following actions or imposing any of the following penalties, the community shall first notify the applicant or other responsible person in writing of its intended action, and shall provide reasonable opportunity, of not less than ten days (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, 24 hours notice shall be sufficient) to cure such violation. In the event the applicant or other responsible person fails to cure such violation after such notice and cure period, the community may take any one or more of the following actions or impose any one or more of the following penalties: 
a.  Stop work order. The community may issue a stop work order, which shall be served on the applicant or other responsible person. The stop work order shall remain in effect until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violation or violations described therein, provided the stop work order may be withdrawn or modified to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violation or violations. 
b.  Termination of water service and/or withhold or revoke certificate of occupancy. The community may terminate utilities and/or refuse to issue and/or revoke a certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements and/or repairs conducted or being conducted on the site until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violation or violations described therein. 
c.  Suspension, revocation, or modifications of permit. The community may suspend, revoke, or modify the permit authorizing the development project. A suspended, revoked, or modified permit may be reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated (upon such conditions as the community may deem necessary) to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violations. 
d.  Civil penalties. Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each act of violation and each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the floodplain administrator from taking such other lawful actions as are necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(3)  Administrative appeal; judicial review. Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the community, including but not limited to the issuance of a stop work order, the assessment of an administratively-imposed monetary penalty, the suspension, revocation, modification, or grant with condition of a permit by the community upon finding that the holder is in violation of permit conditions, or that the holder is in violation of any applicable ordinance or any of the community's rules and regulations, or the issuance of a notice of bond forfeiture. 
The notice of appeal must be in writing and must be received within ten days from the date of the notice of violation. A hearing on the appeal shall take place within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal by the floodplain administrator. All appeals shall be heard and decided by the city board of adjustments, or their designees. The appeal board shall have the power to affirm, modify, or reject the original penalty, including the right to increase or decrease the amount of any monetary penalty and the right to add or delete remedial actions required for correction of the violation and compliance with the community's flood damage prevention ordinance, and any other applicable local, state, or federal requirements.

    The city hereby appoints the building official to administer and implement the provisions of this chapter and is herein referred to as the floodplain administrator and/or the administrator. 
(Ord. No. 2010-10, § 1, 9-21-2010) 
Sec. 42-42. - Permit procedures. 
    Application for a development permit shall be made to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him or her prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, earthen fill, storage of materials or equipment, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
(1)  Application stage. 
a.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all buildings, which will be submitted on a FEMA form 81-31 (elevation certificate) by a state registered engineer or surveyor; 
b.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-residential building in an A zone will be floodproofed; 
c.  Certificate from a state registered professional engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed building will meet the floodproofing criteria in section 42-42(2), section 42-52(2) and section 42-54(2); 
d.  No floodplain development permit can be issued to any mobile, modular, or permanently constructed residence, building or facility unless the owner, lessee, or developer obtains a notice of intent from the state health department, pursuant to the MS Individual On-Site Wastewater Disposal System Law (2009), for a recommendation of a sewage system or proof of compliance from the proper sewer and water district; 
e.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as result of proposed development. 
(2)  Construction stage. Upon establishment/placement of the lowest floor, before framing continues, to include any approved floodproofing method by whatever construction means, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the floodplain administrator a certification of the NAVD or NGVD elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. Said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer, who is authorized by the state to certify such information, and certified by same. When floodproofing is utilized for a particular building said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect, who is authorized by the state to certify such information, and certified by same. Floodproofing shall be required to be at least one-foot above the base flood elevation. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The floodplain administrator shall review the lowest floor and floodproofing elevation survey data submitted. The permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed shall correct deficiencies detected by such review. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project. 
(3)  Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, a FEMA elevation certificate which depicts all finished construction elevations is required to be submitted to the floodplain administrator. If the project includes a floodproofing measure, a FEMA floodproofing certificate is required to be submitted by the permit holder to the floodplain administrator.

Sec. 42-52. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard designated on the community's FIRM, where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in section 42-22, the following provisions, in addition to the standards of section 42-51, are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential building (including manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to no lower than one-foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls of enclosures that are subject to flooding, shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 42-52(4). 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential building (including manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to no lower than one-foot above the base flood elevation. Buildings located in all A-zones may, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be flood proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the building below the base flood elevation (plus a minimum of one-foot of freeboard) are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification, together with an operation and maintenance plan, shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  In special flood hazard areas with base flood elevations (zones AE and A1-30) but without floodways, no encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be permitted unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification must be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
(4)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Enclosed areas, including crawl spaces, shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, and storage. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following criteria:

3.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot above interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher than the exterior grade); 
4.  Openings shall be at least three inches in diameter; 
5.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; 
6.  Limited in use to parking of vehicles, storage, and building access; and 
7.  Limited to 299 square feet. 
b.  Access to the enclosed area shall be minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms. 
d.  Property owners shall be required to execute a flood openings/venting affidavit acknowledging that all openings will be maintained as flood vents, and that the elimination or alteration of the openings in any way will violate the requirements of section 42-52. 
(5)  Detached storage buildings, sheds, or other like accessory improvements, excluding detached garages, carports, and boat houses, shall solely be used for parking of vehicles and storage. Such storage space shall not be used for human habitation and shall be limited to storage of items that can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood damage potential. The storage space shall be constructed of flood resistant or breakaway materials, and equipment and service utilities, such as electrical outlets, shall be limited to essential lighting and other incidental uses, and must be elevated or floodproofed. Flood openings in accordance with the standards of Section 42-52(4) shall also be required. These accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters. 
(6)  Accessory improvements and other appurtenant structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation that may result in damage to other structures. 
(7)  Property owners shall be required to execute and record with the structure's deed a non-conversion agreement declaring that the area below the lowest floor or the detached accessory building shall not be improved, finished or otherwise converted; the community will have the right to inspect the enclosed area. 
(8)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
a.  All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, in existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in new manufactured home parks or subdivisions or in substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring and the flood openings requirements of section 42-52(4). 
Manufactured homes must be: 
1.  Elevated on a permanent foundation to have its lowest floor elevated to no lower than one-foot above the base flood elevation; and 
2.  Securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved, excepting manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to no lower than one-foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation support system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade and adequately anchored foundation support system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement.

1.  Be on site for fewer than 90 consecutive days and shall leave the site for at least seven consecutive days and obtain a new permit before returning to the same site; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
3.  Must meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation requirements of this section 42-52(8)a. or section 42-52(8)b.1. above. 
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed and insured in accordance with the state of Mississippi motor vehicle regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions. 
(9)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard adopted by reference in section 42-22, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge; 
b.  If section 42-52(8)a. above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood damage prevention standards of article V. 
c.  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of section 42-51(2), and the standards of sections 42-52(1) through (3) and the encroachment standards of this article are met. 
Sec. 42-53. - Standards for streams without base flood elevations and floodways. 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard and community flood hazard areas established in section 42-21 and Section 42-22, where no base flood data and floodway data have been provided, the following provisions in addition to the standards of section 42-51, apply: 
(1)  Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than five lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation data; 
(2)  The floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. When such data is available, standards of section 42-52, shall apply. If data is not available from section 42-53(1) or outside sources, then the following provisions shall apply. 
(3)  No encroachments, including fill material or other development, shall be located within a distance of the stream bank equal to five times the width of the stream at the top of the bank or 20 feet each side from the top of the bank, whichever is greater, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The enclosure standards of section 42-52(4) shall apply. 
(4)  The floodplain administrator shall require that the applicant develop the base flood elevation for the development site, utilizing accepted engineering practices and procedures. Upon review of the submitted data, the administrator may accept or reject the proposed base flood elevation. When such data is accepted, standards of section 42-52, shall apply. 
(5)  When base flood elevation data and floodway data are not available in accordance with section 42-21, in special flood hazard areas and community flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established by the community. The enclosure standards of section 42-52(4) shall apply. 
(6)  Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state coordinating office prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such notifications to FEMA. Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained. 
(7)  Require that all manufactured homes be placed or installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. Manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. 
(Ord. No. 2010-10, § 1, 9-21-2010) 
Sec. 42-54. - Standards for shallow flooding zones. 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-21, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions, in addition to the standards of sections 42-51 and 42-52 apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall: 
Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the flood insurance rate map. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated to no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number in feet on the flood insurance rate map. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated to no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to or above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number in feet specified on the FIRM plus a minimum of one foot so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in section 42-52(2). 
(3)  Adequate drainage paths shall be established around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 2010-10, § 1, 9-21-2010) 
Sec. 42-55. - Standards for subdivision proposals and other proposed development. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
(b)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(c)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(d)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for all new subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions), which is greater than {five or 50} lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser. 
(e)  Where only a small portion of the subdivision lot or lots is in an "A" zone special flood hazard area inundated by 100-year flood with no base flood elevations determined and there is sufficient ground slope on the site to avoid possible flooding of structures in zone X areas determined to be outside 500-year floodplain. The floodplain administrator may waive the requirement for a study to determine the base flood elevations. 
(f)  In order for the floodplain administrator to consider waiving the requirement of section F (4) the applicant must provide an accurate topographic data and map for the lot or lots in question certified by a licensed land surveyor and/or professional civil engineer indicating sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the floodplain administrator. 
(g)  Each proposed parcel must have a designated buildable pad or site above the one percent chance floodplain. The distance of the buildable pad or site above the one percent chance floodplain shall depend on the slope of the ground and in accordance with the following table: 
Distance in Feet 
from Zone A 
(one percent 
chance floodplain) Minimum Slope 
from Zone A 
(one percent flood plain to ground level at pad) 20 5% 30 3.33% 40 2.50% 50 2.0% 60 1.67% 70 1.43% 80 1.25% 90 1.11% 100 1.0%

Sec. 42-62. - Duties of variance and appeals board. 
    The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board may appeal such decision to the mayor and board of alderman. 
(Ord. No. 2010-10, § 1, 9-21-2010) 
Sec. 42-63. - Variance procedures. 
    In passing upon such applications, the city board of adjustments shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
(1)  The evaluation must be based on the characteristics unique to that property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or its owners; 
(2)  Variances should never be granted for multiple lots, phases of subdivisions, or entire subdivisions; 
(3)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(4)  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(5)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner and the community; 
(6)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(7)  The necessity of the facility to be at a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(8)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(9)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(10)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(11)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(12)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(13)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges and culverts; 
(14)  Upon consideration of factors listed above, and the purpose of this chapter, the board of adjustments may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter; and 
(15)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(Ord. No. 2010-10, § 1, 9-21-2010) 
Sec. 42-64. - Conditions for variances. 
(a)  Variances shall only be issued when there is: 
(1)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(b)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary deviation from the requirements of this chapter, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. In the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. (See section 42-66.) 
(c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Mississippi Emergency Management Agency upon request. (See section 42-65.) 
(e)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the board of adjustments may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact." 
(Ord. No. 2010-10, § 1, 9-21-2010) 
Sec. 42-65. - Variance notification. 
    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the City of Oxford Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. No. 2010-10, § 1, 9-21-2010) 
Sec. 42-66. - Historic structures. 
    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" only upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(Ord. No. 2010-10, § 1, 9-21-2010) 
Sec. 42-67. - Special conditions.

(3)  The commission shall develop design review guidelines for determining appropriateness as generally set forth in section 54-26. Such criteria shall insofar as possible be consistent with local, state, and federal guidelines and regulations, including, but not limited to, building safety and fire codes and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. 
(4)  The commission shall keep minutes and records of all meetings and proceedings including voting records, attendance, resolutions, findings, determinations, and decisions. All such material shall be a matter of public record to be kept in the planning and development department.

The chairman or any two members may call a special meeting to consider an urgent matter. 
(6)  Notices to individual property owners of a proposed historic landmark or in a proposed preservation district shall be by certified mail. 
(Code 1968, § 141/2-25; Ord. No. 2000-5, § 5, 3-7-2000; Ord. No. 2002-8, § 1, 7-16-2002) 
Sec. 54-24. - Designation of landmarks, landmark sites, and historic districts. 
    By ordinance, the city may establish landmarks, landmark sites, and preservation districts within the area of its jurisdiction. Such landmarks, landmark sites, or preservation districts shall be designated following the criteria as specified in this section. 
(1)  The commission shall initiate a continuing and thorough investigation of the archaeological, architectural, cultural, and historic significance of the city's resources. The findings shall be collected in a cohesive format, made a matter of public record, and made available for public inspection. The commission shall work toward providing complete documentation for previously designated preservation districts, which would include: 
a.  An inventory of all property within the boundary of the district, with photographs of each building and an evaluation of its significance to the district. Building evaluations are to be used only as a reference or guide and shall not be used as the determining factor for issuing or denying a certificate of appropriateness. 
b.  An inventory, which would be in a format consistent with the statewide inventory format of the historic preservation division of the state department of archives and history. The commission shall advise the city on the designation of preservation districts, landmarks, or landmark sites and submit or cause to be prepared chapters to make such designation. 
(2)  A resource may be nominated for designation upon motion of a majority of the commission or by an organization interested in historic preservation or by an owner of the property being nominated. A nomination shall contain information as specified by the commission. The commission must reach a decision on whether to recommend a proposed nomination to the city within six months in the case of a preservation district and two months in the case of either a landmark or landmark site. 
(3)  If the commission votes to recommend to the city the designation of a proposed resource, it shall promptly forward to the city its recommendation, in writing, together with an accompanying file. 
(4)  The commission's recommendations to the city for designation of a preservation district shall be accompanied by: 
a.  A map of the preservation district that clearly delineates the boundaries. 
b.  A verbal boundary description and justification. 
c.  A written statement of significance for the proposed preservation district. 
(5)  No preservation district or landmark or landmark sites shall be designated until the state department of archives and history, acting through such agent or employee as may be designated by its director, shall have made an analysis of, and recommendations concerning, the proposed district boundaries. Failure of the department to submit its analysis and recommendations to the city within 60 days after a written request for such analysis has been mailed, shall relieve the city of any responsibility for awaiting such analysis and the city may at any time thereafter take any necessary action to adopt or amend its chapter. 
(6)  The city shall conduct a public hearing, after notice, to discuss the proposed designation and boundaries thereof. A notice of the hearing shall be published once a week for at least three consecutive weeks in at least one newspaper published in the city. If a newspaper is not published in the city, then the notice shall be published in a paper published in the county. The first publication of such resolution shall be made not less than 21 days prior to the date fixed in the resolution for the public hearing and the last publication shall be made not more than seven days prior to such date. 
(7)  Within 60 calendar days after the public hearing held in connection herewith, the city shall adopt the ordinance creating the district as proposed, reject it entirely, or adopt the ordinance with modifications. 
(8)  Furthermore, the commission shall notify, as soon as is reasonably possible, the appropriate state, county, and municipal agencies of the official designation of all landmarks, landmark sites, and preservation districts. An updated list and map shall be maintained by such agencies and made available to the public. 
(9)  Within any area nominated by the historic preservation commission for historic district designation, no structure or dwelling shall be moved, destroyed or otherwise materially altered and only building permits for interior renovations shall be issued until a determination regarding the creation of such proposed historic district has been finally acted upon by the mayor and board of aldermen, or if approved by the board of aldermen, until the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived establishing the district, pursuant to the procedures set out for such action in this section.

Sec. 54-25. - Certificates of appropriateness. 
    If a building permit or other authorization from either the city building official or the city is required, no exterior feature of any resource shall be altered, relocated, or demolished until an application for a certificate of appropriateness of such work has been approved by the commission. Even if a building permit or other authorization is not required, no construction which affects an exterior feature; exterior alteration; relocation; or demolition of any resource; other than for repainting, minor repair, or routine maintenance; shall be undertaken until an application for a certificate of appropriateness for such work has been approved by the commission. Therefore: 
(1)  The commission shall serve as a review body with the power to make recommendations to the building official and to approve or deny applications for certificates of appropriateness. 
(2)  In approving and denying applications for certificates of appropriateness, the commission shall seek to accomplish the purposes of this article. 
(3)  A certificate of appropriateness shall not be required for work that is ordinary repair or maintenance of any resource.

g.  The relationship of the above factors to, and their effect upon, the immediate surroundings and, if within a preservation district, upon the district as a whole and its architectural, historical character and integrity. 
(2)  New construction. 
a.  In advance of new construction, steps shall be taken to ensure evaluation of possible archaeological resources, as set forth in the Mississippi Antiquities Act (MCA 1972, § 39-7-1 et seq.). 
b.  The following aspects of new construction shall be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which the new construction is visually related, including but not limited to the height, the gross volume, the proportion between width and height of the facades, the proportions and relationship between doors and windows, the rhythm of solids to voids created by openings in the facade, the materials, the textures, the patterns, the trims, and the design of the roof. 
c.  Existing rhythm created by existing building masses and spaces between them shall be preserved. 
d.  The landscape plan shall be compatible with the resource, and it shall be visually compatible with the environment with which it is visually related. Landscaping shall also not prove detrimental to the fabric of a resource, or adjacent public or private improvements like sidewalks and walls. 
e.  No specific architectural style shall be required. 
(3)  Exterior alteration. 
a.  All exterior alterations (other than painting) to a building, structure, object, site, or landscape feature which require a certificate of appropriateness shall be compatible with the resources itself and other resources with which it is related, as is provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section; and the original design of a building, structure, object, or landscape feature shall be considered in applying these standards. 
b.  Exterior alterations shall not affect the architectural character or historic quality of a landmark and shall not destroy the significance of landmark sites. 
(4)  In considering any application for the demolition of a landmark or a resource within a preservation district, the following shall be considered: 
a.  The commission shall consider the individual, architectural, cultural, and/or historical significance of the resource. 
b.  The commission shall consider the importance or contribution of the resource to the architectural character of the district. 
c.  The commission shall consider the importance or contribution of the resource to neighboring property values. 
d.  The commission shall consider the difficulty or impossibility to reproducing such a resource because of its texture, design, material, or detail. 
e.  For commercially zoned property, the commission may issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition without requiring a simultaneous certificate of appropriateness for new construction after evaluating the historic resource inventory, considering a recommendation from the historic preservation consultant or city planning official and finding each of the following elements: 
1.  The resource is not individually, architecturally, culturally, and/or historically significant. 
2.  The resource does not contribute to the architectural character of the district. 
3.  The removal of the resource will not negatively impact neighboring property values. 
4.  The resource is not difficult or impossible to reproduce because of its texture, design, material, detail, or unique character. 
5.  The removal of the resource will not impact the structural integrity or character of the surrounding structures. 
6.  The removal of the resource does not alter or diminish the statement of significance for the establishment of the preservation district where the property is located. 
A landscape plan must be approved by the planning department prior to issuance of the demolition permit if a permit for new construction is not issued simultaneously. Maintenance of the landscape improvements shall be the responsibility of the property owner. In addition, the property owner shall post a landscape bond, certified check, or a letter of credit to the City of Oxford for an amount no less than 100 percent of the estimated cost of procuring, installing, and maintaining for a period not less than 18 months the proposed landscape improvements as approved by the director of planning and development. 
f.  For property that is not commercially zoned, no application for demolition shall be considered without the simultaneous submission of an application for a certificate of appropriateness for new construction unless the following conditions are met: 
1.  The commission makes each of the findings set forth in subsection (f) above; 
2.  The applicant submits a landscape plan and landscape bond as described in subsection (f) above. Maintenance of the landscape improvements shall be the responsibility of the property owner; and 
3.  The applicant submits to the office of the director of planning and development a restrictive covenant prohibiting any construction on the subject property for a period of 48 months from the date of demolition. Such covenant shall be filed with the Lafayette County Chancery Clerk before any demolition permit may be issued. 
g.  When the commission recommends approval of demolition of a resource, a permit shall not be issued until all plans for the site have received approval from all appropriate city boards, commissions, department and agencies.

Sec. 54-36. - Disqualification of members by conflicts of interest. 
    Because the city may possess few residents with experience in the individual fields of urban planning, American history, cultural geography, cultural anthropology, architecture, interior design, landscape design, construction, law, real estate appraisal and related fields, and in order not to impair such residents from practicing their trade for hire, members of the commission are allowed to contract their services to an applicant for a certificate of appropriateness, and, when doing so, must expressly disqualify themselves from the commission during all discussions for that application. In such cases, the city may, upon the request of the chairman of the commission or the vice-chairman in his stead, appoint a substitute member who is qualified in the same field as the disqualified member, and who will serve for that particular case only. If no qualified resident of the city is able to substitute for the disqualified member, the city may appoint, in this case only, a qualified substitute who must be a resident of Mississippi but who is not required to be a resident of Oxford. If any member of the commission must be disqualified due to a conflict of interest on a regular and continuing basis, the chairman or the vice-chairman, in his stead, shall encourage the member to resign his commission seat. Failing this resignation, and, if the commission member continues to enter into conflict of interest situations with the commission, the chairman or vice-chairman of the commission shall encourage the city to replace the member. Likewise, any member of the city historic preservation commission who has an interest in the property in question or in property within 300 feet of such a property, or is employed with a firm that has been hired to aid the applicant in any matter whatsoever, or who has any proprietary, tenancy, or personal interest in a matter to be considered by the commission shall be disqualified from participating in the consideration of any request for a certificate of appropriateness involving such a property. Furthermore, any member of the courthouse square preservation commission who has an interest in the property in question or in property that abuts the property in question, or is employed with a firm that has been hired to aid the applicant in any matter whatsoever, or who has any proprietary, tenancy, or personal interest in a matter to be considered by the commission shall be disqualified from participating in the consideration of any request for a certificate of appropriateness involving such a property. In such cases, a qualified substitute may be appointed as provided above.

It shall be unlawful for any person owning or occupying any lot, parcel or property abutting, or within 200 feet of any public street within the city to permit weeds, grass, brush or other undesirable vegetation to grow to a height in excess of 12 inches.

Violations of this section shall be punished in accordance with chapter 1, general provisions, section 1-8, general penalties, continuing violation; abatement of nuisances, continuing violations. 
(b)  Adjudication of uncleanliness. To determine whether property or parcel of land within a municipality is in such a state of uncleanliness as to be a menace to the public health, safety and welfare of the community, the board of aldermen shall conduct a hearing, on its own motion or upon the receipt of a petition signed by the majority of the residents within 300 feet of any property or parcel of land alleged to be in need of the cleaning. Notice shall be provided to the property owner by: 
(1)  United States mail two weeks before the date of the hearing mailed to the address of the subject property and to the address where the ad valorem tax notice for such property is sent by the office charged with collecting ad valorem tax; and 
(2)  Posting notice for at least two weeks before the date of a hearing on the property or parcel of land alleged to be in need of cleaning and at city hall. 
(c)  Notice to owner; hearing abatement; costs adjudicated. Any notice required by this section shall include language that informs the property owner that an adjudication at the hearing that the property or parcel of land is in need of cleaning will authorize the municipality to reenter the property or parcel of land for a period of one year after the hearing without any further hearing if notice is posted on the property or parcel and at city hall at least seven days before the property or parcel of land is reentered for cleaning. A copy of the required notice mailed and posted as required by this section shall be recorded in the minutes of the governing authority in conjunction with the hearing required by this section. 
    If, at such hearing the mayor and board of aldermen shall, in its resolution, adjudicate such parcel of land in its then condition to be a menace to the public health and safety of the community, the mayor and board of aldermen, shall, if the owner does not do so himself, proceed to clean the land, by the use of municipal employees or by contract, by cutting weeds; removing rubbish, dilapidated fences, dilapidated buildings and other debris; and draining cesspools and standing water therefrom. Thereafter, the mayor and board of aldermen may by resolution adjudicate the actual cost of cleaning the property and may also impose a penalty not to exceed $1,500.00 or 50 percent of the actual cost, whichever is more. The cost and any penalty may become a civil debt against the property owner, or, at the option of the governing authority an assessment against the property. The "cost assessed against the property" means either the cost to the municipality of using its own employees to do the work or the cost of any contract executed by the municipality to have the work done, and administrative costs and legal cost of the municipality. 
    For subsequent cleaning within one-year period after the date of the hearing at which the property or parcel of land was adjudicated in need of cleaning, upon seven days' notice posted both on the property or parcel of land adjudicated in need of cleaning and at city hall as authorized in subsection (b) a municipality may reenter the property or parcel of land to maintain cleanliness without further notice or hearing no more than six times in any 12-month period with respect to removing dilapidated buildings, dilapidated fences and no more than 12 times in any 24-month period with respect to cutting grass and weeds and removing rubbish, personal property and other debris on the land, and the expense of cleaning the property shall not exceed an aggregate amount of $20,000.00 per year or fair market value of the property subsequent to cleaning, whichever is less. The city may asses the same penalty for each time the property or land is cleared as otherwise provided this section. 
(d)  Civil debt; institution of suit. If the board of aldermen declares by resolution, that the cost and any penalty shall be collected as a civil debt, the board of aldermen may authorize the institution of a suit on open account against the owner of the property in a court of competent jurisdiction in the manner provided by law for the cost and any penalty, plus court costs, reasonable attorney's fees and interest from the date the property was cleaned. 
(e)  Lien; assessment enrolled. If the board of aldermen does not declare that the cost and any penalty shall be collected as a civil debt, then the assessment provided for in subsection (c) of this section shall be a lien against the property and may be enrolled in the office of the circuit clerk of the court as other judgments are enrolled, and the tax collector of the city shall, upon order of the board of aldermen, proceed to sell the land to satisfy the lien as now provided by law for the sale of lands for delinquent municipal taxes.

Sec. 87-61. - Number of unrelated occupants in single-family areas. 
    Homes in certain zoning districts of the City of Oxford are designated for occupancy by a single-family. However, this section does not preclude enforcement of any occupancy regulations in zoning districts other than those listed in subsection (2) below. 
(1)  Definitions. 
a.  For purposes of this section, the definition of a "family" is the same as the definition of that term contained in the City of Oxford Land Development Code (see section 117.66), that is, one or more persons who are related by blood, adoption, marriage, or foster care living together and occupying a single housekeeping unit with single culinary facilities, or a group of not more than three persons living together by joint agreement and occupying a single housekeeping unit with single culinary facilities on a nonprofit, cost sharing basis. Any household employees residing on the premises shall not be considered as a separate family for purposes of this definition. 
b.  The terms "occupancy" or "occupy" shall mean the use of a dwelling unit or portion thereof for living, sleeping, and cooking or eating purposes. 
c.  To the extent necessary, this section adopts all definitions set forth in the City of Oxford Land Development Code. 
(2)  Limited number of unrelated individuals. All dwelling units located in (A) Agricultural District, (C-E) Country Estate District, (R-E) Residential Estate District, (R-A) Single-Family Residential District, (R-1A) Single-Family Residential District, and areas of planned unit developments (PUDs) developed as single-family residential subdivisions shall be restricted to occupancy by a family as defined, in subsection (a) above. No person who is not part of such a family may occupy any such dwelling unit. 
(3)  Violation; prima facie proof of occupancy.

Sec. 98-15. - Use of public parking spaces and blocking of city streets during construction projects. 
(a)  During on-going construction projects, individuals and businesses involved in the construction project frequently make use of public parking areas for storage and/or temporary placement of equipment, machinery, materials, dumpsters, and other private property. Anyone so using public parking areas for 30 minutes or more per day shall be assessed a fee of $10.00 per day for each space, or any portion thereof, so used. This fee shall accrue for each day, or any portion thereof in excess of 30 minutes, Monday through Saturday, that the public parking area is so used. Should other public areas adjacent to public parking be so used, then the city may, at its sole discretion, assess a fee on that use of up to $10.00 per day for each additional 200 square feet of public property being used. 
(b)  Any time that a street is blocked, or substantially blocked, for a period of four or more hours in any 24 hour period, the person blocking the street shall be assessed a fee of $100.00 for that day. This fee shall accrue for each day, Sunday through Saturday, that the street is so blocked for four or more hours. Should there be any doubt as to whether a street has been substantially blocked, the director of public works for the city shall make the necessary determination. The person blocking or substantially blocking the street shall be responsible for insuring the safe flow of traffic in the area and for any expenses related to directing or re-routing traffic. Should the city police department or the director of public works determine that conditions in the area warrant that the city provide personnel or equipment to direct or re-route traffic, the person blocking or substantially blocking the street shall reimburse the city for the costs of such personnel or equipment. 
(c)  Any individual or business who intends to make such use of a public parking area or who intends to block or substantially block a city street shall estimate the total amount of fees due under this chapter and pay those fees prior to using public parking areas or blocking a city street. Should the actual use or blockage exceed the estimated fees, then the city may collect the difference. In the alternative, should any individual or business make such use of public parking areas or block city streets without first paying the estimated fees described herein, fees may be assessed by any city official visiting the building site and a 20 percent penalty shall be added. However, any individual or business that pays, in good faith, an estimated amount for fees prior to using public parking areas or blocking a street shall not be assessed a penalty. 
(d)  The fees described herein must be satisfied and evidence of payment provided before a certificate of zoning compliance will be issued for the building. 
(e)  Should the city determine that, in any particular location or at any particular time, such use of public parking areas or such blocking of a city street will either impose a danger or cause unreasonable inconvenience to the city, its citizens, or their property, the city reserves the right to limit the scope of use of public parking areas or limit the extent to which a city street may be blocked or refuse permission to use public parking areas or to block a city street. 
(f)  By accepting the fee described herein, the city in no way agrees to accept responsibility for any private property placed in a public parking area or on a city street, nor does the city grant any right to continuing use or future use of the public parking area or city street. 
(g)  The city may, at any time, direct that any private property, debris, or other material be immediately removed from public parking areas or city streets at the owner's expense. 
(h)  To insure the health, safety, and welfare of the driving and pedestrian public, for all building projects within the City of Oxford, the public works director or his or her written designee in consultation with the chief of police or his or her written designee, are authorized to enact a traffic control plan which shall address and regulate the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic to and from a building site, the timing and method of loading and unloading vehicles at the building site, and any other issue(s) which the public works director and chief of police (or their designees) determine are pertinent to the efficient, safe, and orderly flow of traffic in and around the building site. 
(i)  This section in no way limits or abrogates any other section governing the use of public parking areas or of city streets.

Footnotes:

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2014-26, § I, adopted July 1, 2014, amended article IV in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article IV, §§ 98-90-98-97, pertained to similar material, and derived from the Code of 1968, §§ 25-23-25-30; Ord. No. 2005-4, adopted May 3, 2005; Ord. No. 2007-6, adopted March 6, 2007 and Ord. No. 2007-11, adopted July 3, 2007. 

Sec. 98-90. - Title. 
    This article shall be known as the erosion and sediment control ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2014-26, § I, 7-1-2014) 
Sec. 98-91. - Jurisdiction. 
    The regulations set forth in this article shall apply to all property within the permitting jurisdiction. This article shall be a minimum standard. 
(Ord. No. 2014-26, § I, 7-1-2014) 
Sec. 98-92. - Purpose. 
    During the construction process, soil is most vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches, dredging of watercourses, and causes air quality impacts when sediment particles become entrapped in the atmosphere. In addition, clearing and grading during construction causes the loss of native vegetation. Vegetation holds the soil in place, holds and filters stormwater, provides habitat for terrestrial and aquatic life, and provides a healthy living environment for Oxford citizens. 
    As a result, the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding and regulating the design, construction, use, and maintenance of land disturbances in the City of Oxford. 
(Ord. No. 2014-26, § I, 7-1-2014) 
Sec. 98-93. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Best management practice (BMP) means an action which landowners, developers, and/or contractors can take to reduce the impact of human activity on the natural environment. BMPs to control pollutant discharges from land disturbance can be divided into two main categories: structural and nonstructural measures to minimize quantity and maximize quality of stormwater runoff from a construction site. BMPs can include sediment and erosion control measures, good housekeeping measures, and stormwater measures. Erosion and sediment controls can each be further described as permanent controls and/or temporary controls. BMPs shall meet or exceed recognized effective industry standards as outlined in the Field Manual (see Field Manual). 
    BMP minimum requirements means those basic and standard practices, devices and/or policies as set forth and approved by the city enforcement officers, to serve as a minimal (but not inclusive) level of protection on all sites requiring a land disturbance permit, including single-family residential. 
    Buffer means land that serves as a protective barrier. A buffer may include undisturbed vegetation and/or re-establishment of vegetation. 
    City official means the designated city official. 
    Construction sign means the signage to be included on each site requiring a land disturbance permit. Signage shall include at a minimum "Construction Site - No Trespassing", the contractor's name, 24-hour emergency contact number for the contractor, the name of the QCP, and a 24-hour emergency contact number for the QCP. Signage shall be visible from the street, public right-of-way, or proposed public right-of-way. Signage shall not be larger than three square feet and shall be considered a temporary sign in accordance with the City of Oxford's Land Development Code. 
    Control measures means those best management practice devices as specified on the stormwater pollution prevention plan (aka SWPPP plan), as well as those specified in the Field Manual. Control measures may include, but are not limited to, hay bales, silt fences, earthen berms, retaining walls, temporary or permanent ditch checks, check dams, riprap dams, stormwater retention devices or sediment traps, and any measure certified by an Mississippi Professional Engineer or QCP. 
    Critical areas means environmentally and ecologically sensitive areas to include but not limited to high risk areas for erosion and/or those within 100 feet of floodways, floodplains, wetlands, water courses and gullies, whether applicable to a single-family dwelling or otherwise. 
    Drainage way means any channel that conveys surface runoff through the site, whether intermittent or permanent. 
    Entity means any property owner, lessee, contractor, utility company, person, firm, corporation, or any legal entity, and their employees and agents. The term "entity" shall include all entities with authority or control over the property in issue. 
    Erosion control means measures that prevent erosion (process by which the land surface is worn away). 
    Field Manual means the most current issue of "Field Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control on Construction Sites in Mississippi" - Second Edition (2005) from the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and provides guidance for the prevention or minimization of problems related to erosion, sedimentation and stormwater management on construction sites and erodible urban areas. The Field Manual provides a basis for developing sound plans and implementing appropriate measures (BMPs). 
    Grading means altering the shape of ground surfaces to a predetermined condition; this includes, but is not limited to stripping, cutting, filling, stockpiling and shaping or any combination thereof, and shall include the land in its cut or filled condition. 
    Land disturbance for purposes of this article, means any grading, filling, draining, excavating, ditching or other earthmoving operation which could result in damage to adjacent lands, public or private, from erosion thereto or siltation thereof shall be deemed land-disturbance activity. The cutting of trees (i.e. silviculture) that does not create or aggravate erosion shall not be deemed land-disturbance. 
    Land disturbance permit means a permit issued by the City of Oxford for the construction or alteration of ground. 
    Municipal property means property owned by the city including, but not limited to, city streets, rights-of-way, and storm drainage systems. 
    Perimeter control means a barrier that prevents sediment from leaving a site either by filtering sediment-laden runoff or diverting it to a sediment trap or basin. 
    Phasing means land disturbance of a parcel of land in distinct phases, with the stabilization of each phase before the clearing of the next.

If clearing occurs outside permitting district prior to obtaining site plan approval, then connection to city utilities shall be denied for up to 18 months from date of request for services unless necessary remedies are approved by planning director and city engineer. The delay will not apply to single-family residential construction that is less than one acre. 
(2)  Erosion control. 
a.  Stabilization requirements. Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared or removed by development activities shall be revegetated within 21 days from the substantial completion of such clearing and grading. The following criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts: Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop accompanied by placement of a mulch material or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established over 90 percent of the seeded area. 
b.  Areas in the setbacks must be stabilized within 21 days of being disturbed. 
c.  If vegetative erosion control methods, such as seeding, have not germinated to a coverage of at least 90 percent within 21 days, the city may require that the site be reseeded, sodded, or stabilized with alternative cover. 
d.  Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be accompanied by placement of mulch material or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are capable of controlling erosion. Revegetation sites must exhibit a survival rate of at least 75 percent of the cover crop throughout the year immediately following the revegetation. Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the minimum 75 percent survival rate for one year is achieved. 
e.  On steep slopes or in drainage ways, special techniques that meet or exceed design criteria outlined in the Field Manual shall be used to ensure stabilization. 
f.  Soil stockpiles must be stabilized at the end of each work week or if a rain event is predicted. 
g.  Techniques, as referenced the Field Manual shall be employed to prevent the blowing of dust or sediment from the site onto adjacent properties. The use of chemical agents in or near critical areas is discouraged.

(c)  Additionally, whenever the city determines that off-site sedimentation is occurring or has occurred as a result of a land disturbance activity, despite application and maintenance of protective practices, the person conducting the land disturbance activity or the person responsible for maintenance will be required to take additional protective action. Furthermore, if it is to be determined that sedimentation has occurred off site onto right-of-way, private property, waterways, manmade stormwater drainage systems, the sediment shall be removed in its entirety. 
    In stream and/or wetland sedimentation removal shall be determined by appropriate state and federal agencies. 
(Ord. No. 2014-26, § I, 7-1-2014; Ord. No. 2017-8, § IV, 8-15-2017) 
Sec. 98-99. - Enforcement and penalties for municipal and private properties. 
(a)  In the event any entity shall allow such sediment to be deposited upon adjacent or downstream property, such entity shall immediately remove such sediment from said property and report violation to the city engineer of his designated representative in code enforcement. Self-reported violations are considered violations. Failure to self-report along with any other violation of a provision of this ordinance will constitute separate violations. Enforcement and penalties will be imposed by the number of violations accrued. For example: Failure to self-report and failure to contain sediment within the limits of the site will be considered two independent violations. 
(b)  In addition to removing all sediment from adjacent properties the following stop work orders will be issued until the corresponding conditions are met: 
(1)  First violation. Stop work order issued to allow for the removal of sediment and installation of additional measures to prevent sedimentation from leaving the site in future rainfall events. 
(2)  Second violation. Stop work order issued for a minimum of one week to allow for removal of sediment and installation of additional measures to prevent sedimentation from leaving the site in future rainfall events, and inspection by QCP and city officials. 
(3)  Third violation. Stop work order issued and building permit revoked until board of alderman approve both removal of sedimentation and preventative efforts. The minimum period for revocation of the building permit and application of the stop work order shall be 30 days from the date the third stop work is issued to allow for removal of sediment, installation of additional measures to prevent sedimentation from leaving the site in future rainfall events, resubmission and approval of the storm water pollution prevention plan, and inspection by QCP and city officials. 
(c)  Any entity violating any provision of this article shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not less than $500.00 nor more than $1,000.00 and/or six months in jail or both. Each 24-hour period after notice is given by the city official shall be considered a separate offense hereunder. Furthermore, an entity found guilty of such violation who failed to remove the sediment after notice is given, shall be required to pay to the city or private property owner restitution equaling the costs and expenses of removal. In calculating the costs and expenses incurred by the city, a reasonable rate shall be charged for use of all city equipment and employees, with such rate to be at least equal to the costs of contracting the removal of such sediment with a private entity. 
(d)  Should the city, or an agent thereof, undertake needed remedies due to contractor negligence, the city shall bill the permittee or responsible party for an amount based on actual costs of man hour labor and materials. This fee shall apply to, but not be limited to, city street, sidewalk, right-of-way and storm drain clean-up of sedimentation and/or other pollutants. The city may also withhold any forthcoming certificate of occupancies or final inspections that are relative to the clean-up charges, until the bill is paid in full.

ARTICLE V. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2014-28, adopted July 1, 2014, amended article V in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article V, §§ 98-110-98-113, pertained to similar material, and derived from the Code of 1968, §§ 25-38.11-25-38.14 and Ord. No. 2000-6, adopted March 7, 2000. 

Sec. 98-110. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to diminish threats to public health and safety caused by the runoff of excessive stormwater; reduce economic losses to individuals and the community at large; and protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water resources. The provisions of this article further regulate, guide and control: 
(1)  The subdivision layout, redevelopment and improvement of lands located within the City of Oxford. 
(2)  The construction of buildings and drainage of the sites on which structures are located, including parking and other paved areas. 
(3)  The design, construction and maintenance of stormwater drainage facilities and systems. 
(4)  Any development located outside the city limits, but which seeks water and/or sewer service(s) to be provided by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2014-28, 7-1-2014) 
Sec. 98-111. - General criteria and standards. 
(a)  Applicability. This article shall be applicable within the City of Oxford's jurisdictional area and shall apply to any development which requires a site plan review according to section 212.02 of the land development code, any residential development where a development plan is required or any nonresidential development of three acres or more. This article shall also apply to any development having less than four acres and having 50% or greater impervious surface. 
(b)  Limitation on stormwater runoff. The drainage system will be designed so that, except in unusual circumstances, the rate of runoff of surface water from the site, in the condition in which it is proposed to be developed, will not exceed the rate of runoff from the site in its undeveloped or natural condition. 
    In addition to the requirement listed above, it shall be the responsibility of the developer and his Engineer to ensure that the run-off of the two-, ten, 25-, and 100-year storm events do not create a flooding problem within 500 feet of any run-off exit point from the property which did not pre-exist the development. The developer and his engineer shall also ensure that any pre-existing flooding problems are not worsened by the runoff leaving the site. 
(c)  Detention of excess stormwater runoff. The increased stormwater runoff resulting from the proposed development shall be detained by the provision of infiltration, vegetative, or structural means. Infiltration practices are those that facilitate the percolation of runoff through the soil to groundwater including infiltration basins/trenches, dry wells, and maintained porous pavement. Vegetative means are landscaping features that, with optimal design and good soil conditions, facilitate percolation of runoff. Examples include grassy swales, filter strips artificial wetlands and rain gardens. Structural means include retention or detention facilities designed to gather runoff in wet ponds, dry basins, or multi-chamber catch basins and slowly releasing it. 
(d)  Storage capacity. Retention or detention facilities shall be designed with sufficient capacity to accommodate all runoff caused by the development in excess of that runoff which would occur from the site if left in its natural, undeveloped condition. This storage shall be sufficient to store all excess rates of runoff for the two-, ten-, 25-, and 100-year storms of 24-hour duration. Storage shall also be sufficient to accommodate a storm with an intensity of three inches per hour with a one hour duration. 
    Peak flow (Q YEAR) . The peak flow shall be calculated for the two-, ten-, 25- and 100-year storms. The peak flows shall not be increased at any location for any storm, up to and including the 100 year storm (Q 100) . 
(e)  Discharge velocities. Post development discharge velocity from the drainage system shall not exceed theoretical pre-development velocity. Velocity dissipaters shall be required as described in the outlet control structure section of this article. 
(f)  Channel stability. The stormwater runoff from the proposed development shall not increase channel instability downstream. 
(g)  Retention/detention facilities in floodplains. If detention storage is provided within a floodplain of a major stream, no storage volume for the facility may be provided below the high water elevations established for that floodplain. 
(h)  Stormwater bypass. Drainage systems shall have adequate capacity to bypass, through the development, the natural flow from all upstream areas. 
(i)  Drainageway maintenance. It shall be unlawful to dump trash, debris, landscape waste and other deleterious materials in any and all drainageways in the city. 
(j)  Natural, undeveloped or existing condition. Reference to the natural, undeveloped or existing condition shall mean the condition of the site before any development occurred at any time. If the natural, existing condition cannot be documented through historical means, the pre-developed site will be evaluated using the slope currently present and with 50 percent of the site coverage designated as "wooded" and 50 percent of the site coverage designated as "grassed." The city engineer will provide the runoff curve numbers to be used for the natural, undeveloped or existing condition. 
(k)  Infiltration systems. Any design using infiltration structures should be designed to completely drain the water quality volume into the soil within 24 hours after the storm event and completely dewater between storms. 
    A scientifically credible field test method shall be used to measure the soil infiltration rate and the test results shall be included as part of the stormwater report. The minimum acceptable field measured soil infiltration rate is 0.3 inches per hour. Field measured soil infiltration rates should not exceed 5.0 inches per hour.

(b)  Detention basins. Detention basins shall be constructed to temporarily detain the stormwater runoff in excess of the rate of runoff occurring on the site before development. A detention basin may be designed and constructed for permanent use as well. Both temporary and permanent detention basins will conform to the following standards: 
(1)  Storage volumes. The volume of storage provided in these basins, together with such storage as may be authorized in other detention facilities, shall be sufficient to control the excess rate of runoff from the two-, ten-, 25-, and 100-year storms for 24-hour duration and a storm with an intensity of three inches per hour with a one-hour duration. 
The volume of storage shall also be sufficient to control the excess rate of runoff from the Peak flow (Q YEAR) . 
(2)  Maximum depth. The maximum planned depth of stormwater stored shall not exceed five feet unless natural ground conditions lend themselves to greater depths. 
(3)  Approach slopes. The approach slopes of the basin shall conform as closely as possible to natural land contours. Regrading is allowable if necessary to keep the slopes under ten percent. Erosion control measures shall be provided as well as devices or measures to insure public safety. 
(4)  Dams and dikes. All detention dams or dikes shall be constructed as earth filled and non-overflow type dams with a minimum of one foot of freeboard on the structure for the 100-yr storm event. 
(5)  Outlet control structures. Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as possible and shall operate automatically. They will be designed for multi-stage release to limit discharges into existing or planned downstream channels or conduits so as not to exceed predetermined safe capacities and not in excess of flows which would have occurred with the land in its natural, undeveloped condition for the two-, ten-, 25-, and 100-year storms. Velocity dissipation measures shall be employed to ensure that the discharge does not increase downstream erosion. A surface outlet control structure cannot discharge within 40 feet of an adjacent property line, unless approved by the city engineer. 
(6)  Spillway. Emergency overflow facilities shall be provided to pass the 500-year storm event unless positive measures are installed to control the inflow so as not to exceed the safe capacity of the basin. 
(7)  Appearance. Detention facilities shall where possible, use natural topography and natural vegetation. In lieu thereof, these facilities shall have planted trees and vegetation such as shrubs and permanent ground cover on their borders. 
A system will be designed and implemented to collect any trash that may have washed from the site and prevent it from entering the detention basin. This system will be designed so that it can be cleaned out on a regular basis. The system will also be designed so that the trash settles at the bottom of the collection area and does not prevent water from moving through the device and into the detention facility. 
(8)  Fencing. Detention structures shall be enclosed by a six-foot fence when required by the director of public works or his designated representative. 
(c)  Retention basins. Basins designed with permanent pools shall conform to the standards for detention basins as specified, unless modified or amended as follows: 
(1)  Minimum depths. The minimum normal depth of water before the introduction of excess stormwater shall be three feet. 
(2)  Facilities for emptying. For emergency purposes, cleaning or shoreline maintenance, facilities shall be provided or plans prepared for the use of auxiliary equipment to permit emptying and drainage. 
(3)  Pollution abatement. Aeration facilities may be required, dependent on the quality of the influent and detention time. 
(4)  Side slopes. The side slopes shall be of non-erosive material with a slope of 4:1 or flatter. The ledge shall be four to six feet wide, three feet below normal water depth and sloping gently toward the shore to prevent people or objects from sliding into deep water. There shall be a freeboard of 18 inches above the high water elevation on all retention basins. Alternate designs for side slopes may be considered under special circumstances where good engineering practice is demonstrated. 
(5)  Sediment storage. Adequate area for sediment storage shall be provided in all retention basins. 
(d)  Maintenance of facilities. All improvements, including landscaping, shall be maintained to perform as originally designed and constructed in perpetuity and cannot be developed for any other use which would limit or cause to limit the use of the improvements. The improvements shall be owned and/or maintained by the owner or property owner's association of the development and each property owner shall own a proportionate share of the improvements and shall bear his proportionate responsibility for the continued maintenance in accordance with the above. 
    Each property owner shall, within the contents of his deed, be liable for the combined maintenance of the improvements. A special note to this effect shall appear on any final plat of a subdivision or any plat of condominium and their declarations. 
    The property owner's association shall be formed by the developer in perpetuity for the maintenance of the improvements. Membership shall be mandatory by all property owners. Articles of agreement of the property owner's association must be approved by the board of aldermen of the City of Oxford before recording. 
    In subdivisions consisting of five single-family residential lots or fewer, the provision of a property owner's association may be waived, provided that other parts of this section have been met. 
    When problems arise due to inadequate maintenance, the public works director/city engineer or their designated representative of the City of Oxford may inspect the improvements and compel the correction of the problem by written notice. 
(e)  Inspection of facilities. All stormwater facilities are required to be inspected during and upon completion of construction by a licensed engineer. 
    The engineer responsible for the construction of the stormwater system shall inspect all drainage facilities while under construction. Upon completion of all site construction, the engineer responsible for the construction of the stormwater system shall submit a letter, bearing his signature and stamp, certifying that the facility was constructed and is operating according to the design plan submitted to the city. The city will, at the discretion of the building official and city engineer, reserve some form of service from the development until such certification letter is received, including but not limited to the final certificate of occupancy, water services, final acceptance of streets or utilities, or the final release of any bonds held. 
    The city engineer, or designated representative, may also inspect all drainage facilities any time after construction, in perpetuity, to ensure the long term function and maintenance of the approved design. When facilities are not constructed or maintained according to approved plans, the City of Oxford has the explicit authority to compel compliance and have any situations corrected which are not according to the approved plans. All drainage facilities located on private property shall be accessible at all times for inspection by the city engineer or other responsible public official. 
(f)  Regional detention. The requirements for on site retention/detention facilities may be waived by the City of Oxford if it is determined that a development project is too small, or if engineering, aesthetic or economic factors make a combined or regional facility more practical for construction by the city. In this case, the City of Oxford shall require a fee and/or dedication of land from the developer, which the City shall use to construct the regional facility. This fee and/or dedication of land shall be based on the proportionate share for the development in its completely developed state of the present costs of constructing the regional facility.

No opening or excavation of a cross trench shall extend beyond the centerline of the road before being backfilled, compacted and the surface of the roadway temporarily restored. All trenches will be backfilled in six-inch lifts and compacted with vibratory mechanical compaction. No excavation shall take place unless the mechanical vibratory compactor is actually on the site. All utility facilities shall be located sufficiently ahead of trench excavation work to avoid damage of those facilities and to permit their relocation, if necessary. Storm drains, pipe culverts or other facilities encountered shall be adequately protected by the permittee. If the work performed interferes with the established drainage system of any street, road, or alley, adequate provision shall be made by the permittee to provide proper drainage during construction and to restore the existing system, all to the satisfaction of the director of public works or his or her designee. No dewatering equipment, wells, points, or piping shall occupy the traveled portion of roadways unless specifically approved and adequately protected to the satisfaction of the director of public works or his or her designee. Effluent from dewatering systems shall be discharged in such a manner that erodible soils are not adversely affected. All silt sediments being carried in the dewatering effluent must be intercepted prior to effluent discharge into any drainage system through use of a sedimentation basin designed to allow retention of discharge for sufficient time to render such waters free of suspended silt and sediments. The use of screening devices in lieu of sedimentation basin must receive specific approval from the director of public works or his or her designee and be employed only for minor flows. Any gravel, earth or other excavated material which is caused to roll, flow, or wash upon any road shall be removed from the roadway after deposit and such removal shall not occur more than 12 hours therefrom. In the event the earth, gravel or other excavated material so deposited is not removed, the city or another on behalf of the city may remove the material and any and all costs incurred shall be paid by the permittee or applied from his or her bond. The permittee shall employ construction methods and rests that will keep flying dust to the minimum to the satisfaction of the director of public works or his or her designee. At the first sign of precipitation, all work on the shoulders and traveled way of streets and alleys shall stop and they shall be cleared of all dirt, gravel, and loose materials and the area backfilled until the weather permits resumption of work. 
    Where directed by the director of public works or his or her designee, the permittee shall use hydroexcavation to verify depths and locations of existing utilities. 
(b)  Backfilling. Before backfilling of any cuts, trenches, or openings in streets, roads, or rights-of-way, the permittee shall request an inspection by the director of public works or his or her designee. All backfill material will be free from cinders, ashes, refuse, vegetable or organic matter, boulders, rocks or stones, wet material, or other materials which renders same unsuitable to obtain a firm and compact cover for the installed pipe. The backfill shall be placed in layers not to exceed six inches and each layer shall be thoroughly compacted to not less than 95 percent of the maximum dry density as defined by a Standard Proctor Test. Flowable fill will be substituted for compacted back-fill when directed by the director of public works or his or her designee. A Standard Proctor Test (ASTM D698) shall be conducted by an independent soil testing firm and the results given to the director of public works or his or her designee. The cost of this test shall be borne by the permittee or the person, firm, or corporation doing the backfill.

Sec. 114-86. - To subdivisions. 
    Subdivisions outside the corporate limits of the city may receive water from the municipal water system and deliver wastewater into the municipal sewer system upon the following terms and conditions: 
(1)  Upon recommendation of the city public works director, the mayor and board of aldermen may authorize the developer of such subdivision to proceed with preparation of preliminary plans for such subdivision. 
(2)  Plans for such subdivision shall be prepared in accordance with this Code, and such subdivision shall be developed in accordance with said Code. 
(3)  The total cost of extension of the city's water and/or sewer system to serve such subdivision shall be borne by the developer. 
(4)  Any connection required to provide the services contemplated hereby shall be made to the city water and/or sewer system at a point and in such manner as determined by the public works director. 
(5)  All easements or rights-of-way required for extension of water and/or sewer facilities to serve the subdivision shall be obtained by the developer, and such easements shall be obtained in the name of the city, or be transferable to the city. 
(6)  In the event water and/or sewer facilities to be extended to serve the subdivision are determined by the public works director to have a capacity larger than that required by this Code, then, in such event, the excess cost of the larger facility shall be borne by the city; provided, however, that the city may declare such excess cost not to be economically feasible, and decline to allow such subdivision to be connected to the city's water or sewer system. 
(7)  All water and/or sewer facilities contemplated by this article shall be dedicated to the city for operation and maintenance. 
(8)  A formal, written agreement may be required between the developer and the city in instances involving cost-sharing of excess capacity facilities or other situations where a written agreement would be appropriate.

ARTICLE IV. - REQUIREMENTS FOR DELIVERY INSIDE CORPORATE LIMITS 

Sec. 114-118. - Priorities and definitions. 
(a)  Priority for water and/or sewer facilities shall be given to all areas within the city which are presently developed with residences, businesses, industries, or other buildings, but which are without such facilities. Extension of water and/or sewer facilities shall be done as soon as is economically feasible; provided that the proposed extension meets the feasibility provisions as outlined herein. 
(b)  For purposes of this article, the term "development" means existing or proposed developments. The term "facilities" means water and/or sewer facilities. 
(Code 1968, § 31-60; Ord. No. 1981-27, § 2, 11-3-1981) 
Sec. 114-119. - Feasibility and related provisions. 
    Extension of facilities to any development, whether existing or proposed, shall be in accordance with the following requirements: 
(1)  The city engineer shall make a determination of the estimated cost of extending such facilities to the property to be served. 
(2)  The facilities shall be extended only to the property line of the property to be served, unless the city engineer shall determine that such other location upon said property shall be in the best interest of the city. 
(3)  The estimated cost of such facilities shall include only the cost of materials, labor, and easements required to extend such facilities to provide the minimum service necessary to serve such development. 
(4)  A determination of economic feasibility shall be made by the city using the following procedure: 
a.  The number of new customers shall be determined by the number of new dwellings to be constructed, new lots created, or new buildings to be built as a result of the development. 
b.  The annual water consumption of each new customer shall be projected by comparison of the development to existing similar customers, or using the total consumptions for the past 12 months in cases involving existing developments. 
c.  The annual revenue to be collected by the city shall be determined by multiplying the projected annual consumption of each customer by the current rate for water and/or sewer service. 
d.  The projected gross annual revenue shall be determined by multiplying the number of new customers by the projected annual revenue from each customer. 
e.  The projected total return to the city shall be determined by multiplying the gross annual revenue by five years. 
f.  The amount of total return to the city during the five-year period shall be compared to the estimated cost of extending such facilities. In the event the five-year return to the city equals or exceeds the estimated cost of extending such facilities, the extension shall be deemed to be economically feasible. In the event the five-year return to the city is projected to be less than the cost of such extension, the extension shall be deemed not to be economically feasible. 
(5)  In the event extension of facilities to a development is determined not to be economically feasible, such extension shall be determined to be economically feasible if the developer or owner of the development pays to the city, in cash, a sum equal to the difference between the total return to the city and the cost of such facilities, or constructs a portion of the facility equal to the difference, at no cost to the city. Said portion shall be as determined by the city engineer. 
(6)  The city, at its option, and upon the recommendation of the city engineer, may declare that such facilities to be extended have a capacity larger than that required to serve only the development. In this event, only the cost of the minimum facilities necessary to serve the development shall be calculated to be the total cost for comparison to the total return to the city, and the excess cost of the larger facility shall be born by the city. 
(7)  Any extension of facilities estimated to cost in excess of $2,000.00 may be commenced by the city only after receipt and approval by the city engineer at his option as to the amount and method of a bond, cash, or other surety equal to the estimated cost of the facilities, guaranteeing to the city that the development will be undertaken by the developer within 12 months from the date of such approval by the city engineer of such bond, cash, or other surety. In the event such development is not undertaken within 12 months after such date, the bond, cash, or other surety shall be forfeited to the city. 
(8)  In the event easements must be obtained from property owners not a part of the development, but whose land the extended facilities must cross to reach the development, then, in such event, the cost of obtaining easements shall be included in the total estimated cost of the project for comparison to the total return to the city. Said easements shall be obtained by the city by negotiation with the property owner, and if necessary, by condemnation; provided, however, that in the event easements must be obtained by the city, the developer or owner of the development shall provide the city with an appropriate bond, cash, or other form of surety, the method to be determined and approved by the city engineer, that the proposed project will be constructed. Said bond, cash, or other surety, as determined by the city engineer, shall be provided to the city prior to the city's participation in obtaining the necessary easements and shall be equal to the estimated cost of obtaining such easements by negotiation, the cost to be determined by the city engineer. In the event condemnation is required to obtain such easements, the amount of the bond, cash, or other surety shall be increased to equal the estimated cost of obtaining the easements through condemnation, the cost to be determined by the city engineer. In the event such easements are obtained by the city, and the developer of the proposed project fails to commence construction of the project within 12 months from the date such easements are obtained, then, in that event, such bond, cash, or other form of surety shall be forfeited to the city. 
(9)  In the event any of the facilities to be installed shall be placed upon land under the control of the developer or owner of the development, said developer or owner shall, at no cost to the city, provide such necessary easements to the city as may be deemed necessary by the city engineer. 
(10)  The use of sewage lift stations shall be avoided whenever possible. The city engineer shall determine the most feasible method of providing water and/or sewer facilities to the developer, and may, in certain instances, require that additional gravity-flow sewer lines be installed in lieu of sewage lift stations. 
(11)  The city reserves the right to reject any proposed extension of water and/or sewer facilities in the event the city determines that funds are not available. The city further reserves the right to extend any water and/or sewer facility at any time deemed necessary by the mayor and board of aldermen notwithstanding the provisions of this article.

ARTICLE VII. - TELECOMMUNICATIONS PERMIT ORDINANCE 

Sec. 114-381. - Policy and purposes. 
(a)  Policy. It shall be the policy of the governing authority of the City of Oxford by application of this article to advance telecommunications services by encouraging competition among telecommunications providers to establish affordable rates and increased service options for local consumers, and to protect the public interest and existing utility service facilities by regulating the access to and use of streets, alleys, rights-of-way and other properties that are owned or dedicated by the city for municipal or public use. 
(b)  General purpose. The general purpose of this article is to enable the city to exercise its historical rights, subject to limitations of state and federal law, to manage and control its public and city owned streets, alleys, rights-of-ways and other public and city-owned property in the municipality, and to require fair and reasonable compensation for such access by telecommunications service providers. 
(c)  Objectives. The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To allow the city: 
a.  To preserve the physical integrity of its public and municipal streets, alleys, rights-of-way and public or city-owned properties; 
b.  To control the orderly flow of vehicles and pedestrians; 
c.  To manage and coordinate telephone, data, and telegraph cable and facilities in conjunction with other public utility facilities of various kinds located on, under, over, and crossing streets, alleys, rights-of-way, and properties owned or dedicated by the city for municipal or public use; 
d.  To coordinate construction schedules and require procedures for trenching, street cuts, and repairs required thereby; 
e.  To determine insurance, bonding and indemnity requirements; 
f.  To establish and enforce building codes when applicable to facility improvements in rights-of-way; and 
g.  To keep track of the various systems using the rights-of-way to prevent interference between them; 
(2)  To establish a uniform method for requiring telecommunications providers to compensate the city on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis for use of city and public rights-of-way and properties; and 
(3)  To encourage competition in the provision of telecommunications services by use of city and public rights-of-way and properties by telecommunications service providers without a competitive advantage or disadvantage among providers in their ability to obtain the use thereof. 
(Ord. No. 2012-6, 9-4-2012) 
Sec. 114-382. - Definitions. 
    Governing authority of the city is the city's mayor and board of aldermen. 
    Gross receipts means all revenues determined according to accepted accounting principles originating or received in the city for recurring local services provided within the city limits and billed to an address in the city by telecommunications providers from the transmission or receipt of telephonic or other electronic messages or data, or from the sale or rental of equipment used to provide such communications services by facilities over or in city or public rights-of-way or property. Gross receipts shall not include customer premises equipment not located in, or using public or city rights-of-way or property. Gross receipts do not include taxes imposed, and/or assessed by law on subscribers, or revenues generated from sales to federal, state, city or local government. 
    Permit contract is the written contract provided for by the telecommunications permit ordinance to be entered into between the city and the telecommunications provider, which shall be prepared by the legal department of the city and duly signed and executed on behalf of the city and the telecommunications provider upon such conditions as the contract and this article require. 
    Permittee, under this article, is a telecommunications provider that has entered into a permit contract with the city and has been finally approved (or deemed to be approved) by the public works department of the city to commence work in city or public rights-of-way or property within the city, and to maintain the facilities installed therein. 
    Rights-of-way or property means any street, alley, easement, or other right-of-way, or property in the city that is owned or dedicated by the city or any predecessor in interest for municipal or public use. This nomenclature excludes private property, which is not controlled by this article. 
    Telecommunications provider, for purposes of this article, means any person or legal entity, including, but not limited to, corporations, partnerships of any kind, joint ventures, and associations or business trusts, requiring access to public or municipal rights-of-way or public or municipally owned property as hereinafter defined, for wire, cable or other transmission facilities or equipment for conveyance or reception of telephone, telegraph or other electronic messages, data or any other type of communication. 
(Ord. No. 2012-6, 9-4-2012) 
Sec. 114-383. - Permit contracts. 
(a)  Permit contract. Telecommunications providers are required by this article to contract with the city before being permitted to lay, construct, install, and/or operate and thereafter maintain fiber optics or other telecommunications cable, or any appurtenances or appendages, apparatuses, appliances or other facilities for the transmission or receipt of telephone, telegraph or other electronic messages, data or communications in, on, under, across or over city or public rights-of-way or property within the city. All contracts shall contain certain uniform and nondiscriminatory provisions, and require approval by the governing authority. No contract shall be unreasonably refused by the governing authority of the city to any telecommunications provider certified by the Public Service Commission of the State of Mississippi, who is not in violation of any local ordinance, regulation, or contract, or of any federal or state laws or regulations and has made proper application for a permit contract. A telecommunications provider shall be permitted to install operate and maintain facilities in city or public rights-or-way or property when it and the city have entered into and executed a permit contract, the "permit process fees" hereinafter provided have been paid by the telecommunications provider to the city, and a right to access city or public rights-of-way or property has been approved. 
(b)  Video cable company exemption and requirements. This article does not apply to cable companies operating cable and equipment in city or public rights-of-way or property for commercial video programming pursuant to a valid franchise agreement with the City of Oxford. No telecommunications provider shall utilize city or public rights-of-way or property to provide commercial video programming until it has in effect an approved video cable franchise with the City. 
(c)  Government exemption. Any department or agency of the City of Oxford, Lafayette County, State of Mississippi or the federal government requiring cable installation to be used exclusively for law enforcement, emergency and public service communications and not for profit shall be exempt from entering into a permit contract under this article, provided that said government department or agency shall notify the city's director of public works of the work schedule and provide proposed "as built" plans therefor prior to commencing any work or excavation in, on, across, adjacent to, or over city or public rights-of-way or property in the city. 
(d)  Form and effect of contract. The telecommunications permit contract shall be in writing, shall conform to and incorporate by inclusion or reference all of the conditions and requirements of this article. No contract or permit given by the city under this article shall be interpreted to grant the telecommunications provider an "exclusive" franchise, permit, or final approval for access and use of city or public rights-of-way or property. If any condition, clause, paragraph, section, or word of this article, or of the permit contract given under this article is, or shall become legally unenforceable, the same shall be severed therefrom, and all remaining conditions, clauses, paragraphs, sections or words shall be and continue to be in full force and effect. In the event that any clause or condition of a permit contract given pursuant to this article shall be in conflict with this article, the provisions of this article shall prevail. Where not in conflict with this article and legally enforceable, the permit contract and this article shall be uniformly enforced. This article shall not limit the form of permit contract on a case by case basis from including formal terms and conditions, or additional, or amended terms and conditions covering special circumstances, or provisions added to protect the public interest, or to amplify or effectuate the intentions of this article so long as said terms and conditions are not in conflict with this article and are not designed to give competitive advantage or special privilege to a telecommunications provider. 
(e)  Term of permit contract. The term of the permit contract shall be specified in the permit contract, and shall be for the term of five years, unless a shorter period is agreed to by the telecommunications provider and the city. 
(f)  Renewal of permit contract. At anytime during the period of six months prior to the expiration of the term of a valid permit contract, the telecommunications provider shall be entitled to renewal of its contract for a new term for the same period as provided in subsection (e) by application to the board of alderman, which will be approved subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  Any information in the contract that is no longer current shall be corrected and a new contract with the same or similar provisions shall be executed. 
(2)  An application renewal fee according to standard charges then imposed not to exceed $1,000.00 shall be paid to the city. 
(3)  The applicant for contract renewal shall not be in violation of any city ordinance, its existing permit contract, or any state or federal law or regulation pertinent to its use of city rights-of-way or property, and may be required to present proof of current certification by the Public Service Commission of Mississippi.

(b)  Approval of contract. The director of public works shall prepare for execution by the telecommunications provider the telecommunications permit contract using a standard form of contract for execution in triplicate by the telecommunications provider within 14 days after receipt of a complete application. If the contract is executed at least seven business days prior to the next regular meeting of the mayor and board of aldermen, the contract shall be placed on the agenda for that meeting. Otherwise, the contract shall be placed on the agenda for the following regular meeting of the mayor and board of aldermen. If the application and contract is in order, the mayor and board of aldermen shall authorize execution of the permit contract by the city, and direct the city clerk to accept payment of the permit process fee. A telecommunications provider's permit contract shall be approved when the permit process fee is paid and the telecommunications provider receives duplicate signed originals or duplicate certified copies of the executed contract from the city clerk. An original executed contract shall be retained by the city clerk to be appended to the minutes of the mayor and board of aldermen as evidence of contract approval. 
(c)  Permit process fees. The permit process fee to be paid to the city by the telecommunications provider in order to be permitted and to validate a permit contract shall be $1,000.00. The permit process fee shall be charged as a cost of process, including legal review and preparation of contract, and for engineering and public works review of application and plans and site inspection. 
(Ord. No. 2012-6, 9-4-2012) 
Sec. 114-385. - Plan review and permit to commence work. 
(a)  Engineering process and permit to commence work. 
(1)  Approval required. No new cable, conduit, or facility construction, installation, excavation, expansion or enlargement of existing facilities in, on, under, across, or over city or public rights-of-way or property shall be permitted or authorized under the permit contract until approved according to this section. Maintenance, repairs or replacement of facilities existing as of the effective date of this article, or of facilities already approved and installed under this article are not subject to this section, unless said work shall require relocation, enlargement or expansion of facilities. 
(2)  Submissions. There shall be submitted to the department of public works for engineering and public works review, the following: (i) an original (duplicate original) or a certified copy of the fully executed telecommunications permit contract and (ii) duplicate copies of plans, specifications, maps and other documentation, or data, if any, essential to review the proposed installation of transmission lines, conduit, equipment, and facilities to be constructed or installed with symbols, marks and annotations necessary to accurately identify all public or city ways, streets, easements lands, buildings, conduit or overhead poles or lines where the work is to be undertaken. Specifications as to grade, depth or height in which facilities shall be located shall be submitted where necessary or reasonably required to avoid potential interruption or impediment to existing or planned utility services. Maps and plans shall be drawn to scale or in a manner where distances can be accurately determined and shall allow proper review and interpretation. A proposed work schedule shall be submitted. Where a dangerous or hazardous situation or traffic hazard may occur as a result of the proposed work, an identification of safety measures to be taken may be required, if not submitted. 
(3)  Review, approval/revocation. Within 30 days after receiving the documentation required by (2) above, the public works department by letter or other official writing to the telecommunications provider shall (i) give final approval to commence work according to plans, or according to reasonable modifications or conditions specified in writing, or (ii) specify in writing to the telecommunications provider additional information or documentation required, after receipt of which the public works department shall have twenty (20) days to complete review and respond in writing, or (iii) in the event that the public works department determines that the work as planned cannot for good cause be allowed in city or public rights-of-way or property, it shall give refusal and its reason therefor in writing to the telecommunications provider. If refusal to permit the planned work is for a reason that cannot be cured because modification to plans required by (i) or (ii) above are not submitted and approved within six (6) months from the date of the written notice, the permit contract shall be treated as revoked, and a new contract shall be required to apply for a permit. 
Failure on the part of the public works department to respond in writing as hereinabove provided in this subsection (3) within 60 days after submittal as required by subsection (2) may be treated by the telecommunications provider as permit approval. 
(4)  Notice of when work will commence. The telecommunications provider shall notify the public works department in writing two business days prior to commencing work as to the time and place that it shall commence work according to approved plans. Failure to give such advance notification, or to obtain a waiver of notice from the public works department shall be grounds for the city to stop work, and/or to suspend or revoke permit approval. Any subsequent work permitted under this section, excluding maintenance, repairs or replacement work exempted under subsection (1) above in city or public rights-of-way or property shall require the aforesaid two business days advance notice. 
(b)  Appeals from refusal to allow work to commence. In the event that the public works department refuses to allow work to commence or revokes the contract permit, the telecommunications provider shall have the right to appeal to the mayor and board of aldermen by submitting a written notice of appeal to the city clerk within 15 days after the date of written refusal or permit revocation. Written notice of appeal shall state the reasons upon which the telecommunications provider is aggrieved by the final decision of engineering and/or public works, and the city council shall hear the appeal expeditiously and give a final decision with such conditions, if any, as it deems proper in conformity with this article.

A telecommunications provider, who has entered into a telecommunications permit contract with the city and has been approved for right to access and to commence work as required above, shall pay periodic fees as a "permittee," to be determined according to subsection (b). This fee is charged permittees for continuing access to and use of city or public rights-of-way and property, and shall defray ongoing costs to the city from administering, monitoring, and regulating the maintenance, use and operation of the permittee of its facilities installed in city or public rights-of-way or property, including the expense of on-site inspections and traffic and safety precautions. 
(b)  Calculation and payment of periodic fees. The permittee required to pay periodic fees according to subsection (a) shall pay to the city a quarterly fee of two percent of "gross receipts" as defined above. Gross receipts of "wholesale or discounted" revenue received from a reseller shall be accounted for separately and shall be subject to the quarterly fee of two percent. The periodic fee is not in lieu of any other city fees or taxes assessable to the permittee. The periodic fee shall be due and payable on the fifteenth day of the month following each quarter of the year. The permit contract shall contain uniform provisions for computing and paying the periodic fee, and for auditing "gross receipts," and shall provide standard penalties for failure to timely furnish information or pay the periodic permit fees on gross receipts. 
(c)  Exemption from fees. No fee shall be assessed to any telecommunications provider who is legally operating in city or public rights-of-way or property and not under obligation to pay fees on the effective date of this article, but upon expiration or termination of its permit, franchise or other right of access, this article and the fees required hereunder shall thereafter apply. This article and the fees provided hereunder shall be applicable to permit contracts for new, expanded, or extended service facilities in city or public rights-of-way and city or public property where no permit contract is in effect under this article.

The permittee shall construct, maintain and operate said transmission cable and facilities in such locations, and/or at such depths or heights, below or above the grades of rights-of-way or property surfaces as applicable safety codes require and according to plans and specifications submitted to the director of public works, and all ordinances, laws, or government regulations, federal, state, or local, now legally in force or which may hereafter legally take effect and be applicable to the construction, installation, repair or maintenance of said transmission cable or facilities or of other utility facilities located in, on, under or above city or public rights-of-way or property. Expansion, enlargement or relocation of facilities, not previously approved, shall require the same plan approval process required for initial plan approval above, except that no new permit contract or permit process fee shall be required if a permit contract is already in effect. Maintenance, repair, and minor improvements of facilities properly in place shall not require a contract or further approval unless a safety hazard shall be caused by the construction. 
(b)  Indemnity. 
(1)  Permittees shall indemnify and hold the city, its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability, and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage, or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought that is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused solely by the negligent act, error, or omission of the permittee, its agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate, or subcontractor, while installing, repairing, or maintaining facilities in city or public rights-of-way or city or public property, or resulting from noncompliance with approved plans and specifications of this article or violation of terms or conditions of the permit contract. The indemnity hereby required does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the municipality, its officers, employees, or subcontractors or other permittee. Where comparative negligence is adjudicated, damages shall be apportioned according to the laws of the State of Mississippi. The city does not by this article waive any statutory or common law immunity. 
(2)  Telecommunications provider or city shall promptly advise the other in writing of any known claim or demand related to or arising out of providers activities in city or public rights-of-way or property. 
(c)  Insurance. Permittee shall maintain workers-compensation insurance as required by law and employees liability and general liability insurance coverage, terms of which shall be provided in the permit contract. Where a company provides insurance under a qualified self insurance plan, the city may accept coverage under this plan and require such certifications as it deems necessary to assure that the plan meets all state law requirements and is a reliable plan backed by satisfactory reserves. 
(d)  Violation of permit. For violation of this article by the telecommunications provider, the city shall be entitled to prosecute an enforcement action and/or other action for ordinance violation and for such penalties as may be provided for violation of a city ordinance or state law. Also, violation of the terms of this article or of the permit contract shall be an event of default of the permit contract, and in addition to other remedies available to the city, the city shall be entitled to specific performance, or to cancel the permit contract unless said default is cured by the telecommunications provider on or before 30 calendar days after written notice of default is served by the city on the provider. 
(e)  Transfer of telecommunications permit contract. Transfer or assignment of a permit contract granted under this article shall be effective only after notice of transfer is given by the telecommunications provider to the city, which shall be in writing and include the same information as to address, domicile, principal ownership, management, and other essential information required from the original telecommunications provider. No transfer or assignment shall relieve transferor from any obligation to the city existing at the time of transfer. Failure to pay accrued fees becoming due after transfer shall invalidate the permit contract transfer

There are three types of zoning districts: Base, special, and overlay. 
Sec. 2.2. - Types of zoning districts. 
2.2.1.  Base districts. These are the standard zoning districts established for specific land use types as outlined in the Vision 2037 City of Oxford Comprehensive Plan. A base district may be layered with an overlay district. 
2.2.2.  Special districts. Special districts are established to provide for the highly planned districts requiring customized provisions or districts to achieve a specialized purpose not otherwise provided for in overlay districts. 
2.2.3.  Overlay districts. Overlay districts are established to provide for certain additional requirements, to permit uses not otherwise permitted in the underlying base district, to prohibit uses allowed in the underlying base district, or to establish special development requirements for uses permitted in the base district. Where overlay districts exist and there is a conflict between the requirements or uses specified between the overlay and the underlying district, the standards of the overlay district shall prevail. Otherwise, the standards of the underlying district shall also be in effect for any area additionally zoned for an overlay district. 
Sec. 2.3. - Zoning district boundaries. 
    District boundary lines shall, to the greatest possible extent, follow lot lines, the center line of streets, alleys, or highways or such lines extended, railway right-of-way lines, the municipal corporation lines as they exist at the time of enactment of this ordinance, or natural boundary lines such as streams. Questions concerning the exact location of any district boundary shall be decided by the director of planning and are appealable to the planning commission. 
Sec. 2.4. - City of Oxford Zoning Map. 
    The districts described above and the boundaries of such districts are shown upon the zoning map of the City of Oxford, which map together with all information shown thereon, is hereby made a part of this ordinance. A true and correct copy of the zoning map properly attested shall be on file in the office of the city clerk. 
Sec. 2.5. - Annexation.

Notes: 
1  See exceptions to height limitations in section 3.2. 
2.6.16.1.  Master plan required. A detailed master plan indicating the type of PUD proposed that consists of maps, illustrations and narrative of the proposed planned unit development district shall be submitted to the site plan review committee for study and approval. The decision of the site plan review committee shall be considered as a recommendation to the Oxford Planning Commission. The board of aldermen, based on the recommendation of the Oxford Planning Commission shall make a final decision regarding the application for planned unit development. 
2.6.16.2.  Minimum master plan standards. The master plan must provide for and conform entirely to the following standards: 
a.  Demonstration that specific PUD sub-districts are intended to be developed as unique, innovative, or with standards greater than set forth in this ordinance and with multiple use types. 
b.  The PUD district standards shall indicate the land use, development standards, and other applicable specifications of the proposed development, which, upon approval, shall govern the PUD. If the PUD district standards do not address specific land use, development standard or other specification of this ordinance, the standard of the underlying zoning district shall apply. 
c.  In order to encourage ingenuity, imagination, and high quality design, regulations for residential areas will not specify minimum lot area per dwelling unit but will limit density in residential areas to nine dwellings per acre in attached or detached dwellings or 16 dwellings per acre in multi-family areas, allowing the clustering of dwellings to provide maximum open space. 
d.  Uses permitted in the PUD may be any use that is found in the use table, subject to the approval of the planning commission. Proposed uses shall be listed in the master plan. 
e.  Street widths and improvements thereof, as well as off street parking facilities must conform to street type standards. 
f.  Provisions for water supply, sanitary sewers, stormwater management, electric service and connections shall be made per requirements of the City of Oxford and the State of Mississippi. 
g.  Provision for the management of required open space and amenities shall be included in the master plan. 
h.  Other special improvements may be required if they are deemed reasonable and essential, and may require that appropriate deed restrictions to be filed and recorded enforceable by the city for 25 years with an option to renew. 
i.  The developer shall submit sketches of the plan for the entire project showing the relationship of uses, street patterns, open space and the general character of the proposed development, including a schematic rendering illustrating the character of a typical segment of the development. 
j.  A phasing plan for the sequencing of the development shall be provided. 
k.  Provision for over arching property owners association and, where pertinent, individual property owners associations for different phases including the following: 
i.  Projected date of organization. 
ii.  Organizational structure, including structure of planned timeline for transfer of control from the developer to the association. 
iii.  Diagram of areas to be held in common. 
iv.  Initial estimated fees for the proper functioning of the property owners' association. 
v.  Plan for collective shared maintenance of common areas including stormwater detention facilities. 
vi.  Before building permits are issued for any building in an approved PUD official organization of the applicable property owners association must have occurred. 
2.6.16.3.  The master plan site plan shall conform to the applicable parameters in Table 2.6 and to the technical site plan standards in the appendix of this ordinance. 
2.6.16.4.  The master plan of a planned unit development shall become the zoning designation for a subject tract and shall be developed in conformance with the plan. The PUD shall be designated on the official zoning map with a reference to its approved master plan by case number. 
2.6.16.5.  Preexisting planned unit developments. Within pre-existing planned unit developments (PUDs), regulations for the underlying zoning districts apply where approved PUD documents are silent. Changes to underlying zoning districts apply within PUDs to the extent the underlying zoning applies. And should any properties be removed from a PUD, if authorized by the PUD covenants, they will revert to the underlying zoning district. 
a.  Grand Oaks PUD. This planned unit development (PUD) was first considered in 1993, and later expanded in 1997. This PUD includes a mix of residential uses types, a commercial area, and a country club with golf course. A substantial modification to the PUD was approved by the board of aldermen in October of 2005; and it was annexed into the City of Oxford in 2006. The PUD later split into two sections, Phase 1 and Phase 2 in 2012; which are controlled by different developers, but operating under the same development plan. The underlying zoning established for this PUD reflects the intended uses on the approved PUD plats. 
i.  Grand Oaks PUD Phase One. Most of this phase has been built. There are a few areas of residential development remaining, but the only area with substantial remaining undeveloped land is an area designated for commercial uses along the east side of Highway 7 between Grand Oaks Boulevard and Industrial Park Drive. 
ii.  Grand Oaks PUD Phase Two. There are substantial areas of still undeveloped property in this Phase, designated for residential uses. There are central governing covenants, and a single development entity managing remaining development. In 2015 it was realized that underlying zoning had not been established for the annexed areas, and that was applied; reflecting uses intended in the remaining sections. The last adjustment to the PUD plat was in 2016, which changed the PUD 2 Site Data Sheet to reflect the latest changes to the Parcels and still reflects a total of 2,112 permitted dwelling units. 
b.  Blackberry Hills PUD. This Planned Unit Development was first approved as a PUD in October of 2005 and annexed into the City of Oxford in 2006. What has been development so far is primarily a residential development, although portions are intended for mixed use development. The portions along Molly Barr Road and adjoining areas to the north have been substantially developed with a mix of attached and detached dwellings in cottage and townhouse styles. The portions further to the southwest remain substantially undeveloped. The underlying zoning established for this PUD reflects the intended uses on the approved PUD Plat for a mix of residential types and commercial mixed use areas. 
c.  Oxford Commons PUD. This Planned Unit Development was first approved as a PUD in 2005 and annexed into the City of Oxford in 2006. Several modifications to the mix of unit types and uses mix have been made over time. The PUD also changed ownership since it was formed and currently has several property owners and remaining undeveloped commercial and residential areas. 
i.  Additionally, three areas of property adjoin the PUD and are treated as extensions of the Oxford Commons Development although they are not in the PUD boundary. These are the "Heights" subdivision (due south of Tract M), being built as a subdivision of single-family lots; the "Preserve" subdivision (due north of the western end of Tract G), being built as a subdivision of single-family lots; and The Summit, adjacent to the northwest side of the PUD which is planned to be a commercial area. 
ii.  The last adjustment to the PUD Plan was in December of 2015 when a revision of the PUD Plat was approved which adjusted the use types of Phases A and A1, the commercial areas. The underlying zoning for this PUD reflects the stated intent for land uses in the PUD as established in the 2015 approval. This includes no more than 1,462 dwelling units (at various densities), and no more than 1,285,000 square feet of commercial uses on 560 acres. Building design standards will reflect the standards of those zoning districts.

2.6.17.  HP-Historic preservation overlay district. 
Purpose and Description Allowed Structure Types The historic preservation overlay district is intended to implement the preservation policies of Vision 2037 and Oxford's historic districts. Oxford's historic neighborhoods are a character-defining facet of the community. Not only are they important to the community's image, but they are a critical component of Oxford's high quality of life. All land within the historic preservation overlay district shall be governed by the provision of Chapter 54 of the Municipal Code of Ordinances.

2.6.18.1.  The City of Oxford has distinctive older neighborhoods and commercial areas which contribute significantly to the overall character and identity of the community and are worthy of a level of added protection beyond standard zoning regulations. Some are within designated historic districts while others, even without historic, architectural, or cultural significance, contribute to the context of the city and give their neighborhoods a sense of place. Therefore the purpose of the neighborhood conservation overlay district in these older residential neighborhoods and their adjoining commercial areas is to address the following goals: 
a.  To protect and strengthen desirable and distinctive physical features, design characteristics, and the unique identity, charm and flavor of Oxford's older neighborhoods; 
b.  To protect and enhance the livability of the city, strengthening civic pride; 
c.  To promote new compatible development and prevent blighting influences and reduce conflict caused by insensitive and incompatible development; 
d.  To promote and retain affordable housing; and 
e.  To encourage development design that builds connectivity to adjacent developments and the surrounding community and makes a positive contribution to Oxford's evolving cityscape. 
2.6.18.2.  Old Town Oxford Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District. The Old Town Oxford District was created in 2006 within the land development code. The district was amended by the City in 2014 and 2015. The district encompasses boundaries as designated on the City of Oxford Zoning Map, adopted 2004, as subsequently amended. The boundaries of this district are expanded in the adoption of this revised land development code in 2017. See design standards for this district in section 5.8. 
2.6.19.  FLO-Flood overlay district. 
Purpose and Description Allowed Structure Types The flood overlay district is intended to implement the Natural Area Place Type of Vision 2037. The City of Oxford participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and administers the City of Oxford Floodplain Ordinance. Any land within the City of Oxford lying wholly or partially within the designated 100 year flood plain or floodway fringe is subject to the provisions of the City of Oxford Floodplain Ordinance. The Official NFIP (Insurance Rate) Flood Maps should be consulted for final determination of lands impacted by this provision. Based on underlying zoning district.

2.6.20.  SED-Sex entertainment district. 
Purpose and Description Conditions Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this section to regulate sexually oriented businesses and related activities to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented business within the city, and to avoid the disturbances associated with mixing alcohol and sexually oriented activities. Impacts mitigated. The planning office, planning commission, the mayor, and board of aldermen have found that sexually oriented businesses, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances thereby having a deleterious effect on adjacent areas, such that special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. Furthermore, there is substantial evidence, including numerous studies, reports, and findings on the potential harmful effect of sexually oriented businesses made by other cities, experts, city planners, etc., which document that sexually oriented businesses adversely affect property values, cause an increase in crime, encourage businesses to move elsewhere, and contribute to neighborhood blight. It is the intent of these regulations to mitigate these impacts whenever possible to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents.

A legal nonconforming lot is a lot existing legally at the time of the passage of this Code, or the time of annexation into the city's jurisdiction, which does not because of design or dimensions conform to the regulations of the district in which it is situated. A lot established after the passage of this Code which does not conform to regulations of the district in which it is situated shall be considered an illegal nonconforming lot and is a violation of this Code. Legal nonconforming lots may continue only in accordance with the following provisions: 
3.1.3.1.  Vacant lots. Vacant lots for which plats or deeds have been recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds for Lafayette County, which fail to comply with the minimum area or other dimensional requirements of the districts in which they are located may be used for any of the uses permitted in the district in which it is located, provided that: 
a.  Where the lot area is not more than 20 percent below the minimum specified in this Code, and other dimensional requirements are otherwise complied with, the director of planning is authorized to issue a certificate of zoning compliance. 
b.  Where the lot area is more than 20 percent below the minimum specified in this Code or other dimensional requirements cannot be met, the planning commission may, in its discretion, approve as a variance such dimensions as shall conform as closely as possible to the required dimensions. 
3.1.3.2.  Recombination of nonconforming vacant lots. When two or more adjacent and vacant nonconforming lots are in single ownership, and either of such lots individually has less frontage or area than the minimum requirements of the district in [which] they are located, these lots will be considered and treated as a single lot for the purposes of this Code. The property owner may choose to resubdivide such lots in conformity with this Code to create two or more legal lots of record. 
3.1.4.  Nonconforming uses. A legal nonconforming use is a use existing legally at the time of the passage of this Code, or the time of annexation into the city's jurisdiction, which does not because of use conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.

3.1.4.1.  Expansion prohibited. A nonconforming use shall not be expanded. Expansion shall include an intensification of use, a physical expansion that results in increased capacity or activity associated with the use, an extension of the hours of operation or number of days of activity and any similar change in activity or location. 
3.1.4.2.  Relocation restricted. A nonconforming use shall not be moved from one location on a site to another location on the same site unless the property owner can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director of planning that the relocation of the use will not increase the impacts of such use on the public, will not adversely affect adjacent properties, and will not have the effect of making the nonconformity more permanent. 
3.1.4.3.  Change of use must conform. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other use unless the new use conforms to the standards of the zoning district in which it is located. Once a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, a nonconforming use shall not be re-established. 
3.1.4.4.  Reestablishment restricted. A legal nonconforming use, when discontinued or abandoned, shall not be resumed. Discontinuance or abandonment shall be defined as: 
a.  When land used for a legal nonconforming use ceases to be used in a bona fide manner for 30 calendar days. 
b.  When a building designed or arranged for a nonconforming use ceases to be used in a bona fide manner as a legal nonconforming use for a continuous period of 180 calendar days. 
c.  When a building designed or arranged for a conforming use shall cease to be used in a bona fide manner as a legal nonconforming use for 180 calendar days. 
3.1.4.5.  Reversion prohibited. A legal nonconforming use, if changed to conforming use, may not after that revert or be changed back to a nonconforming use.

c.  Structural changes necessary to convert the nonconforming use to a conforming use shall be permitted. 
d.  An existing nonconforming residential structure may be enlarged or altered provided no additional dwelling units are created. Any such enlargement or alterations shall follow all yard requirements of the district for the use. 
e.  The structure and its accompanying use may be moved to another location on the lot so long as the structure meets all applicable requirements of the district. 
f.  Expansion of a nonconforming use of a building or structure into portions of the structure that, at the time the use became nonconforming, were already erected and arranged or designed for such nonconforming use is permissible. 
3.1.5.  Nonconforming structures, excluding signs. A legal nonconforming structure is a structure, including a building, existing legally at the time of the passage of this Code, or the time of annexation into the city's jurisdiction, which does not because of design or dimensions conform to the regulations of the district in which it is situated. A structure established after the passage of this Code which does not conform to regulations of the district in which it is situated shall be considered an illegal nonconforming structure and is a violation of this Code. Legal nonconforming structures may continue only in accordance with all the following provisions: 
3.1.5.1.  Continuation permitted. A nonconforming structure, devoted to a use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, may continue only in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
3.1.5.2.  Repair and maintenance permitted. Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the continuation of a nonconforming structure. 
3.1.5.3.  Certain enlargements permitted. Any nonconforming structure may be enlarged if the expansion does not increase the nonconformity. 
3.1.5.4.  Changes for conversion permitted. Structural changes necessary to convert the nonconforming use to a conforming use shall be permitted. 
3.1.5.5.  Movement restricted. A nonconforming structure shall not be moved unless afterward it conforms to the standards of the zoning district in which it is located. 
3.1.5.6.  Repair and restoration restricted. A nonconforming structure destroyed or damaged so that more than 60 percent of its tax value remains, may be repaired or restored if: 
a.  A building permit for the repair or restoration is issued within 180 calendar days of the date of the damage and remains valid until the repairs or restoration are complete. 
b.  The type of structure conforms to the standards of the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located; however, if the structure is used for the same purpose as before the destruction, the new structure may be rebuilt using the same materials. 
c.  The total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use is not increased, and the degree of nonconformity in the structure is not increased. 
3.1.5.7.  Conformation required. If the director of planning determines that the building or structure has been damaged to such an extent that the repair costs will exceed 40 percent of the tax value of the building or structure as it existed before the damage occurred, future use of the building and site must conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. However, any building or structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or any building certified as a state historic building may be rebuilt or restored to its original dimensions or the dimensions of the building or structure before such damage occurred, provided such restoration conforms to the Secretary of Interior Standards for Rehabilitation. For the purposes of this section, the extent of damage or destruction shall be determined by comparing the estimated cost of repair or restoration with the current assessed tax value. 
3.1.5.8.  Replacement restricted. A nonconforming structure shall not be replaced with another nonconforming structure regardless of the degree of nonconformity. 
3.1.6.  Nonconforming signs. A legal nonconforming sign is a sign (together with its supporting structure) existing legally at the time of the passage of this Code, or the time of annexation into the city's jurisdiction, which does not by reason of location, type, design or dimensions conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. A sign erected or created after the passage of this Code which does not conform to the regulations of the district in which it is situated shall be considered an illegal nonconforming sign and is a violation of this Code. Legal nonconforming signs may continue only in accordance with all the following provisions: 
3.1.6.1.  Continuation permitted. Subject to the remaining restrictions of this section, nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this Code may be continued. However, a change of occupant, tenant or other site occupying entity requesting sign alterations shall comply with the provisions of this ordinance. 
3.1.6.2.  Increase in nonconformity prohibited. No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming sign. Without limiting the generality of that statement, no nonconforming sign may be enlarged, reduced or altered in such a manner as to increase the nonconformity, nor may illumination be added to any nonconforming sign. 
3.1.6.3.  Movement and replacement restricted. A nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced except to bring the sign into complete conformity with this section. 
3.1.6.4.  Reconstruction limited. If a nonconforming sign structure is destroyed by natural causes, it may not after that be repaired, reconstructed, or replaced except in conformity with all the provisions of this section, and the remnants of the former sign structure shall be cleared from the land. For purposes of this section, a nonconforming sign is "destroyed" if damaged to the extent that the cost of repairing the sign to its former stature or replacing it with an equivalent sign equals or exceeds the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of the sign before damage. 
3.1.6.5.  Message change permitted. The message of a nonconforming sign may be changed for the occupant, tenant or other site occupying entity as of the adoption date of this Code so long as this does not create any new nonconformities. 
3.1.6.6.  Repair limited. Subject to the other provisions of this section, nonconforming signs may be repaired and renovated so long as the cost of such work does not exceed 50 percent of the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of such sign as calculated within any 365 calendar day period. 
3.1.6.7.  Abandonment. If a nonconforming sign or sign frame remains blank for a continuous period of 180 calendar days, that sign shall be deemed abandoned and shall, within 90 calendar days after such abandonment, be altered to comply with this section or be removed by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located, or other person having control over such sign. For purposes of this section, a sign is "blank" if any of the following criteria apply: 
a.  It advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted. 
b.  The advertising message it displays becomes illegible in whole or substantial part. 
c.  The advertising copy paid for by a party other than the sign owner or promoting an interest other than the rental of the sign has been removed. 
3.1.6.8.  Conformity required. The following types of nonconforming signs or signs that are nonconforming in any of the following ways shall be altered to comply with the provisions of this section or removed within 90 calendar days after the effective date of this Code: 
a.  Signs advertising an enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted. 
b.  Portable signs and temporary signs. 
c.  Signs that are in violation of article 7. 
3.1.6.9.  Removal required. Nonconforming signs, if present anywhere on the site, shall be removed before issuance of a change of use permit, certificate of zoning compliance, issuance of a grading permit, or commencement of new construction on the site. 
3.1.7.  Nonconforming features. A legal nonconforming feature is a physical characteristic existing legally at the time of the passage of this Code, or the time of annexation into the city's jurisdiction, which does not because of design or dimension conform to the regulations of the district in which it is situated. Nonconforming features include, but are not limited to, physical characteristics of development that exceed allowable maximum standards (e.g. impervious surface, structure height, etc.), and those that lack or fall short of required minimum standards (e.g. sight triangle, off-street parking and loading spaces, buffer width and lighting standards, etc.). A feature added or changed after the passage of this Code which does not conform to regulations of the district in which it is situated shall be considered an illegal nonconforming feature and is a violation of this Code. Legal nonconforming features may be continued subject to the following limitations: 
3.1.7.1.  Increase in nonconformity prohibited. No action shall be taken which increases the degree or extent of the nonconformity. Any enlargement, extension, structural alteration, parking changes, and other changes to lot design and access shall conform to all current requirements of this section. 
3.1.7.2.  Continuation permitted. For development existing (or for which a vested right had been established) before the effective date of current regulations, nonconforming features created by a change in regulations may continue to exist, and structures with such nonconforming features may be reconstructed if demolished or destroyed. 
3.1.8.  Nonconforming accessory uses and structures. No nonconforming accessory use or accessory structure shall continue after the principal use or structure is terminated by abandonment, discontinuance, damage, or destruction unless such accessory use or accessory structure after that is made to conform to the standards for the zoning district in which it is located. 
3.1.9.  Nonconforming manufactured home parks. 
3.1.9.1.  Expansion prohibited. Nonconforming manufactured home parks may not be expanded or increased in size which shall include adding spaces to the park. 
3.1.9.2.  Replacement of park prohibited. When a nonconforming manufactured home park is vacated, the park shall not be reestablished. 
3.1.10.  Changes of tenancy and ownership. There may be a change in tenancy or ownership of an existing nonconforming use or structure provided there is no change in the nature or character of such nonconforming use or structure except as permitted in this section.

Sec. 3.3. - Table of Uses. 
3.3.1.  Establishment of Table of Uses. The uses permitted in each zoning district established in article 2 are set forth in Table 3.3. A use must be actively functioning to be considered a use eligible for conforming or nonconforming status. No protections are granted to an unexercised right to a use. 
3.3.2.  Determination of use category. 
3.3.2.1.  The Director of planning shall decide as to whether any proposed use is permitted within the city's zoning jurisdiction based on the uses listed in the Table of Permitted Uses. Whenever it is not clear whether a proposed use is or is not permitted, the director of planning shall consult the 2012 North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), as amended, to help decide. Any use not specifically listed in the Table of Uses, and any proposed use not substantially like a listed use as determined by the director of planning shall be deemed to be prohibited. 
3.3.2.2.  Where the symbol "P" is shown, the use to which it refers is permitted as a use by right in the indicated district, provided it complies fully with all applicable development standards of this Code including the standards in sections 3.4 to 3.11 for the use. 
3.3.2.3.  Where the symbol "S" is shown, the use to which it refers is specially permitted in the indicated district.

4.2.1.  Streets shall be classified by both function and type. Street functional classification shall refer to a streets capacity to accommodate vehicular traffic. A street type shall refer to its specific design to accommodate both its function and the adjacent zoning district it serves. 
4.2.2.  Streets are functionally classified in one of three categories-Arterials, collectors, and locals. See specific standards in Table 4.2, and definitions in article 10. 
4.2.3.  Classification types. Streets, public or private are further classified according to the following street types established below, derived from Vision 2037 Comprehensive Plan: 
a.  Local street - Rural local or collector. 
b.  Parkway - Level 1 (rural arterial). 
c.  Parkway - Level 2 (rural arterial). 
d.  Neighborhood street (city local or collector). 
e.  Suburban street 1 (city local). 
f.  Suburban street 2 (city collector). 
g.  City avenue 1 (city collector or arterial). 
h.  City avenue 2 (city collector or arterial). 
i.  Main street 1 (city collector or arterial). 
j.  Main street 2 (city collector or arterial). 
k.  Alley. 
4.2.4.  Functional classification of street types. The street types established above are functionally classified according to the classifications set out in Table 4.1 - Functional Classification of Street Types. 
Table 4.1 - Functional Classification of Street Types 
Arterial Collector Local Boulevard (City) ¦ - - Parkway (Rural) ¦ - - Main Street (City) ¦ ¦ - Avenue (City) ¦ ¦ - Local Street (City) - ¦ ¦ Local Street (Rural) - ¦ ¦  
Sec. 4.3. - General access and circulation requirements. 
4.3.1.  Developments shall provide sufficient public road access to accommodate the ultimate traffic volume anticipated, and to enable safe and convenient service by police, fire, and other emergency vehicles. 
4.3.2.  Adjacent properties. Street stubs into adjacent properties may be required to provide the potential for greater interconnectivity and ensure adequate future circulation. (See section 4.5.9.2 for temporary dead end street standards.) 
4.3.3.  Reserve strips. Strips of land preventing access to the right-of-way at the terminus of, or adjacent to, existing or proposed roads shall not be permitted unless approved by the planning commission. 
Sec. 4.4. - Emergency access roads. 
4.4.1.  Any residential development with 80 or more homes, and more than 250 bedrooms shall have at least two separate emergency access roads. 
4.4.2.  An emergency access road shall be at least 24 feet wide with all-weather surfacing designed and maintained to support the imposed loads of fire and emergency apparatus and shall have a vertical clearance of at least 13.6 feet. If a structure on that access road is greater than 30 feet in height, the road shall be a minimum of 26 feet wide to accommodate aerial fire apparatus. 
4.4.2.1.  No parking is permitted on minimum width emergency access roads. A road or street intended for public ingress into or egress from a development can serve as an emergency access road so long as it complies with the requirements of this section. 
4.4.2.2.  A boulevard with a median may not be considered as two separate emergency access roads. 
4.4.2.3.  It is preferred that emergency access road entrances shall be separated by a minimum of 150 feet, although a shorter distance may be considered if recommended and approved by the Oxford Fire Department and Emergency Management Agency. 
4.4.2.4.  Gates shall not be allowed on any primary or secondary access road, but if a third road is proposed for emergency ingress/egress only, it could be gated with a recommendation of approval from the Oxford Fire Department and Emergency Management Agency; provided that the gate meets the requirement of the land development code. 
(Ord. No. 2018-11, 7-17-2018) 
Sec. 4.5. - Conventional street design standards. 
4.5.1.  Right-of-way width. The minimum widths of street and road rights-of-way and pavement widths, measured perpendicularly from lot line to lot line, shall be as shown on such plan and not be less than indicated in Table 4.2. 
4.5.2.  Variation in right-of-way. Any request for variation in right-of-way or street width requirements shall be requested in writing for recommendation by the city engineer before consideration by the planning commission. 
4.5.3.  Right-of-way dedication. 
4.5.3.1.  Arterial roads. Those roads designated in the comprehensive plan shall either be dedicated, or a permanent reservation shall be provided, and front building setbacks shall be shown on the final plat as measured from the proposed right-of-way. 
4.5.3.2.  Collector streets. Dedication for collector streets shall be made in accordance with in accordance with Table 4.2. A dedication variance may be granted for developments with frontage on existing collector streets if it is determined that a variance would not adversely affect current or future traffic movement and either: 
a.  The collector road is existing and fully developed on both sides of the road such that additional dedication and widening is not feasible and, the collector road dedication is not at an intersection with a minor or principal arterial, or another collector road which may require additional right-of-way for turn lanes or other traffic control measures; 
b.  The collector street is not likely, in the foreseeable future, to serve enough traffic volume to justify requiring additional dedication. 
4.5.3.3.  Local streets. Dedication for local streets shall be in accordance with Table 4.2. Additional dedication for existing local streets may be grated a variance under the criterial outlined in Table 4.2. 
4.5.3.4.  Partial street dedications. Partial dedications may be permitted only in those instances where it is necessary for the proper development of the property and is in the public interest to locate a public street on a common property line. Sufficient right-of-way shall be provided for at least 24 feet of pavement, in addition to curb, gutter and sidewalk when required by the provisions of these regulations. 
4.5.4.  Access limitations. 
4.5.4.1.  Access shall be provided to all lots from dedicated public streets unless otherwise prohibited or modified below: 
a.  Access limitation. Where a subdivision abuts an existing or proposed arterial, double frontage lots with no access to the arterial, lots with rear service drives, common access drives, or other treatment may be required. 
b.  Residential driveways. Driveways should not be permitted on arterials. Where this requirement cannot be met, shared or common driveways may be required. All driveways shall be designed to provide egress in a forward motion and must be constructed of concrete or bituminous material. 
c.  Ingress-egress easements. Ingress/egress easements shall be shown graphically on the preliminary plan, and on the final plat accompanied by a statement describing the responsibility for maintenance.

d.  Restricted access. All access shall be graphically indicated on the preliminary plan and final plat or site plan unless otherwise directed by the city engineer. 
4.5.5.  Curb cuts. 
4.5.5.1.  The number, location and design of curb cuts shall be subject to approval by the City Engineer at the time of site plan review. For new development, a common development which includes more than one lot shall be treated as one lot for the purposes of determining the location of curb cuts. Split ownership, planning in phases, construction in stages, and/or multiple building permits for a project shall not prevent it from being considered a common development. 
4.5.5.2.  Curb cuts shall be located and designed to provide safe and convenient ingress and egress to the site, and designed in accordance with City of Oxford standards and the latest edition of the MDOT manual for constructing driveways. 
4.5.5.3.  Multiple commercial and industrial curb cuts for driveways within a subdivision on an arterial street are discouraged. 
4.5.5.4.  Shared curb cuts and internal access between adjacent similar developments is encouraged. 
4.5.5.5.  Curb cuts, except where shared, shall be located a minimum of ten feet from a parcel or lot line. 
4.5.5.6.  No curb cut shall be closer than 20 feet from the point of curvature of a corner radius. 
4.5.5.7.  Curb cuts (other than driveways in a single-family residential development) shall be located directly opposite one another or separated by a minimum of 150 feet and shall align with median cuts whenever feasible. 
4.5.5.8.  Curb cuts in commercial or multi-family developments are limited to one per 300 feet of street frontage. The distance between curb cuts in detached or attached residential developments are at the discretion of the city engineer. 
4.5.5.9.  Variations from these standards shall be permitted at the discretion of the planning commission (on the advice of the city engineer) where the variation would enhance the safety, efficiency of travel and operation of the roadway. Examples can include the use of joint driveways, cross easements, service drives and alignment of median openings with existing access connections. 
4.5.5.10.  Refer to [section] 4.9.5 for additional direction regarding curb cuts for driveways. 

4.5.6.  Intersections. 
4.5.6.1.  Spacing. Intersections on the same side of a street shall be spaced a minimum of 300 feet apart for arterial and collector streets, and 150 feet for local streets, measured from centerline to centerline. 
4.5.6.2.  Angle. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by the planning commission upon recommendation of the city engineer. 
4.5.6.3.  Centerlines. The centerlines of two streets intersecting the same road on opposite sides shall be offset as shown and illustrated above and noted in Table 4.2. Offset dimension "C" between intersections is categorized by the type of streets involved. If the two legs creating the offset are different types of streets, the shorter of the offset dimensions "C" shall apply. 
4.5.7.  Radii. Minimum radii of intersections of property lines at arterial and major street intersections shall be rounded with a radius of 25 feet. An increased radius shall be required when the angle of intersection is less than 90 degrees or when the intersection involves an arterial or major street. Property line radii at street intersections involving arterial or collector streets shall be not less than 35 feet. The city engineer shall determine the appropriate corner radii and make recommendation to the planning commission. 
4.5.8.  Curves. 
4.5.8.1.  Horizontal. The minimum centerline radius permitted for each street classification is shown in Table 4.2. 
4.5.8.2.  Vertical. Every change in street grade shall be connected by a vertical curve designed to afford a minimum sight distance of 200 feet as measured from a driver's eyes, which are assumed to be four and one-half feet above the pavement surface, to an object four inches high on the pavement. Vertical curves shall be of standard parabolic design. 
4.5.9.  Turnarounds (cul-de-sac). 
4.5.9.1.  The minimum radii for all public streets and roads on the turnaround end of the cul-de-sac shall be 50 feet for right-of-way and 40 feet for the paving surface. 
4.5.9.2.  Temporary dead-end streets. Streets that are allowed to be temporary cul-de-sacs that are not intended to be opened for 12 or more months, must be constructed with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least 80 feet, and a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet. When the road is extended, the developer will be responsible for removing the turnaround and sodding the residual land to return to the pertinent property owner. While the road is closed it shall be posted with a sign stating that the road will be extended in the future and open to through traffic. 
4.5.9.3.  Permanent dead-end streets. No permanent dead-end streets shall be allowed that will serve fewer than eight dwellings or more than 16 dwellings. Such streets shall be no longer than 800 feet in length, and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least 80 feet, and a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet. 
4.5.10.  Sight distance. The minimum sight distance for the various street and road types are shown in Table 4.2. Stopping sight distance is measured in feet in accordance with the AASHTO publication A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, as amended. 
4.5.11.  Grades. All streets shall have a minimum topographic gradient of 0.5 percent. Grades on arterial streets shall not exceed ten percent. Grades on all other streets shall not exceed 12 percent. The maximum allowed gradient within 100 feet of intersecting centerlines shall be a maximum of five percent. 
4.5.12.  Tangents and center radii. 
4.5.12.1.  Minimum centerline tangents. Permitted minimums on approach to intersections are shown in Table 4.2. 
4.5.12.2.  Tangents between curves. Between curves there shall be a centerline tangent not less than 300 feet in length on arterials, and 100 feet on all collector streets. No tangent is required on minor, loop, or cul-de-sac streets. 
Sec. 4.6. - Application of street type cross sections. 
4.6.1.  Application of street types. 
4.6.1.1.  Proposed new development and redevelopment designs shall appropriately incorporate established street types in development designs. 
4.6.1.2.  New streets and streets proposed for improvement shall be established according to the zoning district in which they are located as stated in Table 4.3 - Street Types by Zoning District projected function and anticipated traffic volumes. 
4.6.2.  Street type design parameters. Specific design elements for each street type are reflected in the following tables and illustrations. The travel lane width refers to the distance between the stripe and excludes curb and gutter and any required shoulder (typically one foot to two feet) on roadways without curb and gutter or when bike lanes are not present adjacent to the travel lane. In the absence of stripe, the travel lane shall be measured from the center of the roadway to the nearest edge of the gutter pan.

Sec. 4.7. - Easements. 
4.7.1.  Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at least five feet wide for side lot lines and 15 feet wide for rear lot lines. 
4.7.2.  The city engineer shall determine if a drainage easement shall be provided whenever any stream or important surface drainage course is located in an area that is being subdivided. If the city engineer determines that a drainage easement is warranted, the subdivider shall provide an adequate easement area along each side of the stream for the purpose of widening, deepening, sloping, improving, or protecting the stream or drainage course. The city engineer shall determine the adequacy of the drainage easement. 
4.7.3.  Easements for City of Oxford water or sewer shall meet the minimum essential widths required for each utility type according to the City of Oxford specifications. Additional easement width may be required for utilities located at depths [of] ten feet or more. 
Sec. 4.8. - Required infrastructure improvements. 
4.8.1.  Cost of improvements. The total cost of all improvements required by this article shall be borne by the developer. These costs shall include the cost of all improvements within the development, and may include all or a portion of the cost of improvements outside the development which are necessary to serve the development, as determined by the mayor and board of aldermen. 
4.8.1.1.  Warranties. 
a.  A warranty bond or certified check shall be posted by the developer which is available to the City of Oxford, for an amount of not less than 15 percent of the total estimated construction cost as approved by the city engineer. 
b.  Each developer shall warrant and guarantee to the city all materials and workmanship to be free from defects for a period of one year from the date of acceptance of any improvements by the mayor and board of aldermen. 
c.  Any work performed by the City of Oxford on facilities guaranteed by the warranty bond or certified check during the warranty period shall be charged to the developer and billed by the City of Oxford Public Works Department. Any arrears shall be sufficient cause for the City of Oxford to notify the developer and call the developer's warranty bond or certified check to use for completion of required facilities. 
d.  Should the mayor and board of aldermen find that extraordinary hardship may result from strict compliance with these regulations, they may consider the regulations to the minimum amount that will allow substantial justice to be done and the public interest secured. 
4.8.2.  Water mains. In order to insure adequate water pressure in new subdivisions and in order to provide ample water for fire protection no water main shall be less than eight inches, or a size required by the city engineer. Fire hydrants shall not be less than six inches and shall comply with the city's engineering specifications, and shall not be located more than 1,000 feet apart nor more than 500 feet from any lot in a subdivision, or as required by the Life Safety Code. 
4.8.3.  Sanitary sewage disposal. 
4.8.3.1.  Every subdivision within the city shall be connected to a public sewer main or shall be provided with a complete sewerage system which will adequately and safely serve the area platted, as approved by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and the city engineer.

ARTICLE 6.0. - ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS 

Sec. 6.1. - Tree preservation and protection. 
6.1.1.  Purpose. The purpose of these requirement is to: 
6.1.1.1.  Aid in stabilizing the environment's ecological balance by contributing to the processes of energy and soil conservation, air purification, oxygen regeneration, pollutant neutralization, groundwater recharge, and the reduction of stormwater runoff, while at the same time aiding in noise, glare, and heat abatement by preserving the existing tree canopy; 
6.1.1.2.  Ensure that the stock of native trees and vegetation is maintained and replenished; and 
6.1.1.3.  Provide visual buffering and enhance the beautification of the city. 
6.1.2.  Principles. This section shall be enforced according to the following principles: 
6.1.2.1.  Preservation of existing trees shall be the first, best, and standard approach. 
6.1.2.2.  If preservation cannot be achieved, on-site mitigation shall next be pursued. 
6.1.2.3.  If those approaches cannot be achieved, payment shall be made to the Tree Escrow Account. 
6.1.3.  Applicability. 
6.1.3.1.  Except as noted herein, requirements apply to all land located in in the city that is the subject of any subdivision of two or more lots, any commercial site plan on a site of 15,000 or more square feet, any parking lot for three or more cars, or any residential site plan with three or more dwelling units. Modifications to these standards may be allowed in conformance to the standards of affordable housing incentives ordinance adopted by the mayor and aldermen. Trees may not be cleared from any applicable site for any purpose without a site plan approval and land disturbance permit. 
6.1.3.2.  Trees cleared for agriculture or forestry in districts where allowed, or for the installation or maintenance of public utility easements, or the safety and protection of property are exempted if 50-foot buffers are maintained along property lines, next to bodies of water, and along either side of stream beds. On a certified tree farm (verification from Mississippi Forestry Commission required) a final harvest done according to the requirements for harvest on a certified tree farm may be carried out with no tree mitigation requirement if completed following Mississippi Best Management Practices for Forestry in Mississippi and the American Forest Foundation Standards of Sustainability, and completed as required according to the forest management plan established for the certified tree farm. Prior to the harvest the owner must contact the planning department to inform the city of the intended harvest, and the intended harvesting plan. After the harvest, a report from the forestry commission must be provided certifying that the harvest was completed as stated in the harvesting plan. The land will then subject to tree mitigation based on the trees remaining after that harvest. The harvest must also leave a 50-foot buffer along property lines and around bodies of water; along both sides of any perennial or intermittent stream, and a 25-foot buffer along both sides of any drainage channel, and along any public roads running adjacent to or through the property. A land disturbance permit to allow tree harvesting may be requested on property of ten or more acres in any zoning district that has been under single ownership since 2007 or earlier. A tree inventory is required, no clearing shall be permitted in perimeter site buffer areas, and the site must be seeded and protected after harvesting to prevent erosion. Up to 50 percent of the trees on the property may be harvested before mitigation is required. 
6.1.3.3.  In any zoning district, one land disturbance permit to allow tree harvesting may be requested on a property of ten or more acres that has been under ownership of a person or family since 2007 or earlier. Proof of ownership is required, no clearing shall be permitted in required buffer areas, and cleared areas of the property must be seeded and protected after harvesting to prevent erosion. A tree survey and harvesting plan must be done and submitted to the planning department, and no more than 50 percent of significant or specimen trees may be harvested. The harvest must also leave a 50-foot buffer along property lines and around bodies of water; along both sides of any perennial or intermittent stream bed, and a 25-foot buffer along both sides of any drainage channel, and along any public roads running adjacent to or through the property. If compliance with the harvesting plan is verified, tree mitigation on the site shall be based on the forest remaining on the site. 
6.1.4.  Permit required. Under this article, the clearing of any site is permitted only after a tree inventory has been completed and a site plan permit has been acquired. 
6.1.4.1.  Tree inventory required. An inventory of existing trees is required for any site plan or subdivision. The inventory must be conducted by a licensed arborist and submitted to the director of planning for approval. 
6.1.4.2.  The inventory shall include: 
a.  The location, size, type, and quality of existing significant, specimen and heritage trees; 
b.  Which trees are to be removed and which retained; and 
c.  The location, size, type, and quality of the trees and any significant vegetation to be retained. 
6.1.4.3.  Tree inventory method options. 
a.  On development sites of less than ten acres, an inventory of the entire site is required. 
b.  On sites of more than ten acres, a representative sampling method may be used. For that method, 25 percent of the site or a minimum of ten acres (whichever is greater) must be surveyed. The acreage may be a single site or a more representative selection of several sites. A determination of the total number of trees (significant, specimen, and heritage) on the site will be derived from a multiple of the tree varieties found in the survey area (or areas) applied to the entire site. 
c.  The developer must provide a recently dated aerial photo of the site (within the past three months) for conducting the inventory. 
6.1.5.  Site design guidelines. Design for development shall consider: 
6.1.5.1.  Generally. Potential for retaining existing site topography and existing vegetation. 
6.1.5.2.  Parking lots. Shall be designed to preserve the maximum number of existing significant, specimen, and heritage trees and other significant vegetation. 
6.1.5.3.  Curb cuts. All proposed curb cuts shall consider damage to trees and tree groves and shall be placed in areas to provide the least damage to existing trees and tree groves. 
6.1.6.  Tree preservation criteria. The director of planning shall consider the following factors, and any other relevant information, when evaluating the tree preservation plan shown on a submitted landscape plan: 
6.1.6.1.  The desirability of preserving a tree or group of trees by reason of age, location, size, or species. 
6.1.6.2.  Whether the size or shape of the lot reduces the flexibility of the design. 
6.1.6.3.  The general health and condition of the tree or group of trees, or the presence of any disease, injury, or hazard. 
6.1.6.4.  The placement of the tree or group of trees in relation to utilities, structures, and the use of the property. 
6.1.6.5.  The need to remove the tree or group of trees for the purpose of installing, repairing, replacing, or maintaining essential public utilities. 
6.1.6.6.  Whether roads, utilities and building footprint are designed in relation to the existing topography, and located, where possible, to avoid damage to existing tree canopy. 
6.1.6.7.  Construction requirements of on-site and off-site storm drainage. 
6.1.6.8.  The extent to which development of the site and the enforcement of this article are impacted by state and federal regulations.

6.1.7.2.  For each tree grove retained, extra credit shall be available for one, two-inch caliper tree equal to the total DBH of all significant and/or specimen trees retained within a tree grove divided by the rate of mitigation of five inches. 
6.1.7.3.  In the old town conservation overlay district and on sites greater than five acres, for each heritage tree retained, extra credit shall be available for one, two-inch caliper tree equal to the total DBH of all heritage trees retained divided by the rate of mitigation of one inch. 
6.1.8.  Tree protection. Trees identified on an approved landscaping plan, subdivision plat, or site plan to be retained shall utilize the following protection methods: 
6.1.8.1.  Install four-foot high perimeter fencing at the extreme outer edge of the dripline. 
6.1.8.2.  Perimeter fencing located within 50 feet of any building footprint, unless approved by the director of planning or the building official, shall be constructed of wood or metal materials. 
6.1.8.3.  The fencing must carry durable signs designating the area as a "tree protection zone" and shall remain in place throughout the construction period. Such signs shall be placed around the perimeter of all tree protection zones with a maximum spacing of 25 feet and be a minimum of 80 square inches in size and shall be firmly affixed to the tree protection fence. 
6.1.8.4.  There shall be no activity of any kind inside the perimeter other than hand-brush clearing. 
6.1.8.5.  No land clearing or building permits shall be issued until the perimeter of all protected trees and tree groves have been properly fenced. 
6.1.8.6.  Grates or other pervious surfaces shall be utilized within the dripline of existing trees to allow water and air to reach the tree roots. 
6.1.8.7.  Fill (or other soil disturbance) shall be prohibited, as well as any vehicle traffic or material storage in areas under the dripline of trees to be protected. 
6.1.8.8.  Drastic changes in drainage patterns which may negatively affect existing trees shall be avoided. 
6.1.8.9.  Any person who intentionally damages a protected tree shall be in violation of this article and subject to the penalties prescribed in article 9. 
6.1.8.10.  The removal of the protected fencing, or encroachment into the area, without explicit approval of the property owner or his designated agent, shall be punishable by a fine up to the replacement value of the tree(s) involved. Replacement value shall be determined by a method approved by the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA). This applies to any person or entity, public or private. 
6.1.9.  Tree mitigation requirements. The intent is to leave undisturbed as many existing significant, specimen and heritage trees as possible. Mitigation is required for removal of significant, specimen, and heritage trees removed. 
6.1.9.1.  Each development will have a ten percent credit applied before any mitigation is required. For example, if there were 1,000 inches DBH of existing trees, 100 inches could be removed without mitigation. 
6.1.9.2.  For trees that will be removed, the number of trees required for mitigation shall be based upon the existing significant, specimen, and heritage trees to be removed. 
6.1.9.3.  Mitigation may be made through replanting or contribution to the tree escrow account. 
6.1.9.4.  Trees in poor health and/or hazard trees will not require mitigation if the condition is so determined by a designated city official, and in the event of a dispute, an International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) certified arborist will make a determination at the expense of the developer. 
6.1.9.5.  Existing significant trees located within a building footprint, street, driveway, sidewalk, pathway, or utility easement shall generally not require mitigation. Heritage trees removed in the old town conservation overlay district, or heritage trees removed on sites greater than five acres, even if within such areas, shall require mitigation. 
6.1.9.6.  Replanting. 
a.  For each existing significant tree removed, replacement trees shall be planted at one, two-inch caliper tree per five inches of trees removed, measured at DBH. 
b.  In the Old Town Conservation Overlay District, and on sites greater than five acres, replacement of heritage trees shall be planted at rate of one, two-inch caliper tree per two inches of trees removed, measured at DBH. 
c.  Smaller trees. The director of planning may approve the use of trees less than two-inch caliper for the planting of medium tree species (dogwoods and red buds) and/or greater than two-inch caliper on an equal total caliper basis, e.g. two, three-inch caliper trees equals three, two-inch caliper trees. 
d.  Placement of trees. The applicant is expected to plant trees in locations on the site where the environmental benefits of canopy cover are most likely to offset the impact of development. Trees shall not be placed within utility easements, or in other locations where their future protection cannot be assured. 
6.1.10.  Tree escrow account. Any applicant unable to achieve on-site mitigation shall make a payment to the City of Oxford's Tree Escrow Account for each tree required to meet the mitigation requirements set forth above. The amount of money to be paid shall be based on the fair market value of materials and labor at the time of planting as determined by the director of planning based on standard costs incurred by the city, estimated annually. The applicant shall submit cost estimates to the director of planning for approval. 
6.1.10.1.  Money contributed in lieu of on-site mitigation shall be paid prior to issuance of a building permit and/or prior to final plat approval by the board of aldermen for all residential and nonresidential subdivisions. 
6.1.10.2.  Money contributed under this section: 
a.  May be used for tree canopy management, replacement, and preservation including, but not limited to, tree acquisition and planting; canopy replacement site identification, acquisition, and preparation; the acquisition of parkland areas that preserve tree canopy; and the acquisition, planting and maintenance of trees on designated city property; and 
b.  Shall not revert to the general fund for ongoing operations. 
6.1.10.3.  Where it is not possible to plant all required mitigation trees within the development, alternate planting locations will first be sought on appropriate sites within a one-mile radius of where the development is located. If this cannot be achieved, the funds shall be used in on city property closest the development, and if that cannot be achieved, for any purposes noted above anywhere in the city limits. The location of appropriate planting spaces is to be derived from Oxford's Master Tree Plan or as determined by the mayor and board of aldermen. 
6.1.10.4.  Refunds. 
a.  The city shall refund any portion of the money contributed under this section, including the accrued interest that has not been expended seven years from the date of the contribution. Interest shall be based on the rate of return the city has experienced over the period. 
b.  Notice of the right to a refund, including the amount of the refund and the procedure for applying for and receiving the refund, shall be sent or served in writing to the applicant no later than 30 days after the date which the refund becomes due. The sending by regular mail of the notices to the applicant shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirement of notice. 
c.  The refund shall be made on a pro rata basis, and shall be paid in full no later than 90 days after the date certain upon which the refund becomes due. 
d.  At the time of the contribution to the tree escrow account, the director of planning shall provide the applicant with written notice of those circumstances under which refunds of such fees will be made. Failure to deliver such written notice shall not invalidate any contribution to the tree escrow account under this article. 
6.1.10.5.  The tree escrow account shall be managed by the city clerk. The city clerk will consult with the director of planning, the superintendent of buildings and grounds, and the Oxford Tree Board to ensure that all tree management and planting efforts undertaken by the city are fully coordinated. The city clerk shall annually provide the director of planning with an accounting of where tree escrow account funds have been spent. 
6.1.10.6.  The tree board shall annually provide to the director of planning and superintendent of building and grounds, a list of preferred areas where tree escrow funds should be utilized. The director of planning and superintendent of building and grounds shall consider those recommendations along with other recommendations from the mayor and board of aldermen and the director of parks and make final recommendations to the mayor and aldermen who will determine the use of these funds. 
6.1.11.  Prior tree removal. 
6.1.11.1.  Prior removal of significant and/or specimen trees. If a site is cleared or significant or specimen trees removed prior to obtaining subdivision or site plan approval, but after a tree survey has been completed and submitted, then any development application for the site shall be denied for up to 24 months from the date of the requested development application except as authorized below: 
a.  A request for site plan approval within the 24-month time frame may be considered, however, if the proposed site plan incorporates a reforestation plan that results in a future canopy coverage of 40 percent of the site or the applicant agrees to contribute to the tree escrow account equal to the cost of implementing the reforestation plan or a combination of both. 
b.  The square foot percentage of canopy area required is based on the total area of the property less the square footage dedicated to the building footprint, street, driveway, sidewalk, pathway or utility easement. 
6.1.11.2.  Prior removal of heritage trees. If a site is cleared or any heritage trees removed prior to obtaining subdivision or site plan approval, but after a tree survey has been completed and submitted, then any development application for the site shall be denied for up to 36 months from the date of the requested development application except as authorized below: 
a.  A request for site plan approval within the 36-month time frame may, however, be considered if the proposed site plan incorporates a reforestation plan that results in a future canopy coverage of 40 percent of the site or the applicant agrees to contribute to the tree escrow account in an amount equal to the cost of implementing the reforestation plan or a combination of both; and pays a fine of $500.00 per acre of trees cleared and $1,000.00 per each heritage tree removed. 
b.  The square foot percentage of canopy area required for reforestation shall be based on the total area of the property less the square footage dedicated to any building footprints, streets, driveways, sidewalks, pathways, or utility easements. 
6.1.11.3.  Tree removal before tree survey is conducted. If a site is cleared before a tree survey is prepared and provided to the director of planning, then any development application for the site shall be denied for up to 36 months. A request for a site plan approval within the 36-month time frame may, however, be considered if the proposed site plan incorporates a reforestation plan that results in a future canopy coverage of 40 percent of the site or the applicant agrees to contribute to the tree escrow account equal to the cost of implementing the reforestation plan or a combination of both; and pays a fine of $3,000.00 per acre of trees cleared.

Where there is no conflict, the provisions of article 7 will apply. 
a.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, the historic preservation ordinance, or the historic preservation design guidelines, all business signs located within the historic urban center district or any designated historic preservation district are to be regulated by the standards below. All sign regulations in the historic preservation districts take precedent over any provisions in this chapter when there is a conflict. Where there is no conflict, the provisions in this chapter will apply.

Each window sign may cover no more than 15 percent of one window or door, and each wall sign may cover no more than 15 percent of the façade of the building. Where only one window sign is proposed, the percentage from the second allowed sign may be aggregated to allow 30 percent coverage of one window. 
d.  Business identification, "branding symbols," logos, product or service advertising signage, symbols, borders, decals, decorative elements, and lettering are considered cumulatively when evaluating proposed signage. All such elements shall be included in the calculation of sign coverage for any projecting, hanging, awning, window, door, wall, or marquee signs. 
e.  When signage elements as described above are proposed for multiple windows or doors on a façade: 
i.  The signage elements may cover no more than 15 percent of one window or door. Alternatively, signage elements may be aggregated to allow up to a maximum of 30 percent total window and door coverage on each façade with a public entrance. Coverage shall not exceed 50 percent of any one window.

Sec. 9.2. - Site plan approval. 
9.2.1.  Purpose of site plan review. Site plan review shall be required to ensure compliance with land development code and other ordinances as they apply to designated projects, to expedite procedures necessary for obtaining building permits; to provide the developer with one central review of his development proposal; to conserve the time and efforts of city employees in various departments; and to provide for a speedy processing of applications for building permits on large scale and other projects. A Site plan review fee shall be charged in accordance with the adopted fee schedule. 
9.2.2.  Applicability. Unless determined otherwise by the Director of Planning, a site plan review shall be required for proposed development including (but not limited to) any subdivision of property, any residential development of five or more dwelling units except individual building lots already approved, any structures with more than two stories, any commercial development adjacent to property zoned for primarily residential use, any development requiring special or special exception approval, any development located within a flood plain, any commercial development requiring the services of a licensed engineer or architect, or any commercial development within 200 feet of a street intersection, any open parking area to be constructed or enlarged. A site plan review by the planning commission shall be required for all development except the following: 
9.2.2.1.  Any residential development of less than five dwelling units. 
9.2.2.2.  Any residential, business, or industrial development of one acre or less proposing structures with a cumulative size (within all structures and accessory buildings on the site) of less than 5,000 square feet. Site plans for structures of 5,000 to 10,000 square feet may require approval by the planning commission if determined by the planning director to be a site of interest to the public. Applications for site plans in this size range will be noticed and posted to allow public input which will inform the planning director as to the level of public interest in the site plan. 
9.2.2.3  Any parking area of three or less spaces. 
9.2.3.  Pre-application conference sketch plat. Prior to the submittal of any site plan of an applicant may meet with the planning department to discuss the site plan review process. Applicants are advised to submit a sketch plan for informal advice as to the appropriateness of the proposed site plan. This step does not require a formal application, fee, or filing of plat. A pre-application sketch plan should contain the information and be presented in the form listed in the appendix sketch plan standards. 
9.2.4.  Procedure. Site plans shall be filed with the director of planning who shall submit the plan to the site plan review committee to determine if all required information has been correctly and sufficiently submitted. No site plan shall be deemed filed and accepted for official review until the director of planning determines that all information required by this section, in appendix A-7, or in any other required ordinance of the City of Oxford has been fully submitted. In all zoning districts other than TND and PUD, a site plan review shall be approvable by the site plan committee (and planning commission when appropriate) as a single review process. For TNDs and PUDs with multiple phases and sub-phases a two-step approval process may be requested allowing approval of a preliminary site plan for each phase independently, and subsequent final site plan approval for sub-phases, following the procedure in section 9.2.10 below. 
9.2.5.  Compliance. Once the submitted site plan has been accepted for review, the site plan review committee shall complete their evaluation of the site plan and certify to the director of planning that said site plan does or does not comply with all ordinances of Oxford, Mississippi. 
9.2.5.1.  If the site plan does comply and there is no rezoning or other consideration pending, the director of planning shall approve the site plan or forward the approved site plan to the planning commission for approval (as applicable), and so notify the applicant in writing. 
9.2.5.2.  If a rezoning application or other consideration is pending, the director of planning shall forward such approved site plan to the planning Commission and the appropriate city departments as applicable along with a written statement that such action is pending, and so notify the applicant in writing. 
9.2.5.3.  If it is determined that the site plan does not comply, the site plan review committee shall so specify in what respects it does not comply and what additional information is needed to complete the review of the site plan application. This shall be conveyed in writing by the director of planning to the applicant. Correction of all specified items will be required before further processing of the site plan application. 
9.2.6.  Time period for review. In all cases, the site plan review committee shall have up to or a maximum of 45 calendar days from the date the application is determined to be complete to review and recommend either approval, approval with specific conditions, or disapproval of any site plan. The director of planning may, however, extend the time for the site plan review committee's consideration to allow time for the applicant to submit additional information that is needed to complete the site plan application. If the site plan application requires approval by the planning commission, such extension may require that the application not be heard at the originally scheduled review date before the planning commission. 
9.2.7.  For an application verified as complete, should the 45-day period expire without action by the committee, the director of planning shall add the application to the agenda of the planning commission for resolution at their next regularly scheduled meeting. 
9.2.8.  Validity. A site plan approval is valid for 18 months. If permits have not been issued within the timeframe, the site plan is voided unless extended by the planning director. The director may extend the site plan approval for 12-month increments, annually. In considering the extension of any site plan, the director may take into account whether any significant progress has been made toward the completion of all elements of the approved site plan. Any site plan which has not been completed, with occupancy permits issued, within five years shall become subject to any applicable modifications to the land development code. 
9.2.9.  Site plan amendment procedure. Should the developer of an approved site plan wish to modify any element of the approved site plan; the director of planning shall determine if the modification is significant enough to require approval by the planning commission. Minor waivers, as authorized in this article, may be approved by the director of planning. Appeals of such decisions would be to the planning commission. 
9.2.10.  Site plan review conditions and approval.
