PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Davidson, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1978 Code, as supplemented and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1978 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Code Attorney, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Leamon B. Brice, Town Manager, Richard Kline, Town Attorney and Peggy Smith, Town Clerk for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

Sec. 10-131. - Impoundment. 
(a)  Any animal that is found to be un-owned or to be in violation of any provision of this chapter is subject to immediate impoundment if the animal's owner is non-existent, unknown, or found to be unavailable after a reasonable attempt to identify, locate, and/or notify the animal's owner has been made. Any animal that is so impounded shall be held at the Davidson Police Department or at a Davidson PD-approved facility for three working days, excluding the day of impoundment.

In addition to any other authority or procedure authorized by this chapter or by any other law to seize an animal, the Davidson Police Department or the respective county animal control agency shall have the authority to summarily seize and forfeit to the Davidson Police Department or respective county animal control agency any animal when the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency determines that there is probable cause to believe that the animal: 
(1)  Under the totality of the circumstances, is dangerous or prejudicial to the public safety or public health and the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency has issued a probable cause notice on the animal (dangerous animals).

(Ord. of 4-10-2012) 
Sec. 10-133. - Dangerous animal seizure and forfeiture procedure. 
(a)  Probable cause notice required. No animal shall be seized on the basis that it is dangerous or prejudicial to the public safety or public health without the prior issuance of a probable cause notice. This limitation shall not prohibit seizure based on other lawful authority, nor the subsequent issuance of a probable cause notice for an animal otherwise seized or impounded. 
(b)  Probable cause notice. Probable cause notices may only be issued by a person of supervisory rank with the Davidson Police Department or the assigned member of a respective county animal control agency. The probable cause notice shall state the following: 
(1)  The specific facts constituting probable cause for declaring the animal dangerous; 
(2)  That a prompt hearing to determine whether or not the animal is dangerous shall be held as soon as possible; 
(3)  That anyone in possession of the animal shall immediately turn the animal over to the Davidson Police Department or the respective county animal control agency; and 
(4)  If the animal's owner is known, the probable cause notice shall also order the owner to immediately contact the Davidson Police Department and shall state the manner in which the Davidson PD may be contacted. 
    The Davidson PD shall notify the owner as soon as reasonably possible of the probable cause notice if the owner is known. If the owner is unknown, the Davidson PD shall make reasonable efforts to determine who the owner is and try to notify the owner. If any Davidson PD employee has any communication about a particular case regarding a suspected dangerous animal, that employee shall keep a written report of the date and the content of any such communication. 
(c)  Owner's duties. The owner shall turn the animal over to the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency immediately upon receiving a probable cause notice. The Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency shall have the authority to seize immediately any animal for which a probable cause notice has been issued. It shall be unlawful for the owner or occupant of any premises to fail to give an animal to the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency immediately upon the presentment of a probable cause notice. 
(d)  Authority to permit animal to remain on premises. The supervisor who issued the probable cause notice shall have the authority to authorize that an animal may remain on the premises or elsewhere prior to the seizure/forfeiture hearing if the supervisor is satisfied that the animal's confinement shall be adequate for protecting the public and for the well-being of the animal. The supervisor who allows the animal to remain without seizure shall order the animal to be kept adequately confined and shall issue a containment order in compliance with section 10-135. A failure of the animal to be kept so confined shall result in the immediate seizure of the animal. The Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency shall always have the authority to summarily seize an animal after the probable cause notice has been delivered and before the seizure hearing. 
(e)  Request for hearing. The owner of an animal subject to a probable cause notice shall have the right to a hearing to determine whether the animal shall be declared dangerous as defined in this chapter. The owner of the animal shall request a hearing by submitting a written request during normal working hours to the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency within ten working days after the delivery of the probable cause notice or all reasonable efforts to deliver (delivery) the probable cause notice to the owner. 
(f)  Failure to request hearing. If the owner fails to properly file a timely request for a hearing with the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency, the Davidson PD administrative sergeant shall determine whether the animal is dangerous. The standard to be applied is whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, the animal is dangerous or prejudicial to the public safety or public health. The Davidson PD administrative sergeant shall make findings of fact to support the determination, and the determination shall be conclusive. The Davidson PD administrative sergeant may dispose of the animal as provided for in subsections (i) and (j) of this section. If the Davidson PD administrative sergeant, due to a conflict of interest or any other circumstance, is unable to make such determination, the chief of police shall appoint a person to make the determination. 
(g)  Hearing. Upon a proper and timely request, a hearing shall be held. The supervisor who issued the probable cause notice or his designee shall present whatever relevant evidence the supervisor has that the animal should be declared dangerous. The owner shall be entitled to present whatever relevant evidence the owner wishes and to have legal representation. All testimony before the hearing officer shall be sworn testimony. The entirety of the hearing shall be recorded. If physical evidence is presented by either side, the hearing officer shall have such evidence photographed as part of the record and shall describe the item fully for the record. 
(h)  Hearing officer. The administrative Davidson Police Sergeant, or other adjudicator, as designated by the chief of police, shall act as the hearing officer for any violation hearings. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing to determine whether the animal shall be declared dangerous or not. The hearing officer must declare to the chief of police if there is any conflict of interest or the appearance of such. The Davidson Chief of Police shall determine whether it is necessary for the hearing officer to withdraw. In such event a new hearing officer shall be designated by the chief of police. The recused hearing officer shall disclose any facts, knowledge or any information known by them regarding the particular situation for the record at the very beginning of the hearing. The recused hearing officer shall respond to any questions about any past knowledge about the particular situation. The appellant shall have the right to state for the record any specific findings of fact about the particular situation that the appellant believes precludes the hearing officer from conducting an impartial hearing of the case. 
(i)  Decision and written orders. The standard to be applied is whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, the animal is dangerous or prejudicial to the public safety or public health. The hearing officer's decision shall be supported by specific findings of fact and specific conclusions based upon the findings of fact. The Davidson PD Administrative Sergeant, if the Davidson PD Administrative Sergeant acts as hearing officer over the objections of the appellant, shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions regarding such objections for that particular case. All findings of fact must be supported by competent and material evidence in the record and must be included in the record. 
    The hearing officer shall issue a written order based on his decision. The written order shall declare whether the animal is found to be dangerous or prejudicial to the public safety or public health or non-dangerous. If the animal is found to be dangerous or prejudicial to the public safety or public health, the hearing officer shall have the authority to terminate the owner's ownership rights in the animal and to dispose of the animal in accordance with this subsection, or the hearing officer may suspend the termination of ownership rights conditioned upon the owner's compliance with such terms as the hearing officer deems necessary to ensure that the animal may be kept by the owner in safety. If such terms are part of a written order suspending seizure/forfeiture, the terms and the written order shall comply with the requirements of section 10-135. The Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency manager shall have the authority to modify the terms when it is necessary to ensure the safety of the public. The termination of ownership rights may be invoked upon the failure to comply with any of the terms. Written orders shall include the following statements: 
(1)  Whether the animal is dangerous and prejudicial to the public safety or health or non-dangerous. (If non-dangerous, nothing further is required.) 
(2)  That the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency has the authority to terminate ownership rights of the animal and to order the humane destruction of the animal. 
(3)  Whether the ownership rights are being presently terminated or if such termination is suspended. 
(4)  If the termination is suspended, the terms and condition on which the termination is suspended in compliance with section 10-135. 
(5)  That a failure to comply with the written order could result in termination of ownership rights and humane destruction of the animal. 
(6)  That any appeal to the superior court of the hearing officer's decision must be filed within 30 days. 
(j)  Disposition of animal. The Davidson PD Administrative Sergeant or the respective county animal control agency shall have the discretion to dispose of any animal forfeited to the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency under this section in one of only two specific ways: 
(1)  By humane destruction of the animal; or 
(2)  By giving the animal to an individual or an organization subject to the protective and inspection conditions required by the Davidson PD Administrative Sergeant for the well-being of the animal, for the protection of the public and for the purpose of preserving and taking care of the animal. Such conditions shall reserve the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency's right to seize and humanely destroy the animal upon any failure to comply with the conditions. An animal declared to be dangerous by the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency manager shall not be disposed of for research or experimental purposes. 
(k)  Appeal to superior court. The decision of the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency or of the town manager or his designee shall be subject to review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Any petition for writ of certiorari for review by the superior court shall be filed with the clerk of superior court within 30 days after delivery of or reasonable efforts to deliver the decision to the owner or the owner's representative. Prior to the filing of the petition for writ of certiorari with the clerk of superior court, a cash bond must be provided to the town for all costs incurred thus far by the town's retention of the animal and for an approximate time for the course of the appeal, as well as for the cost of the transcript prepared for the court. The town shall reimburse the petitioner for the cost of the petitioner's transcript and the court's transcript if the court reverses the decision and determines that the animal is not dangerous. If a petition for writ of certiorari is filed in superior court, the animal shall be confined at the animal shelter or at a location solely acceptable to the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency. Appeal shall not toll compliance with any written or containment order pending the hearing of such appeal.

The notice, if sent, shall include the following statements: 
(1)  An order to the animal's owner to contact the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency immediately. 
(2)  A brief statement of the date, location, and reason for the seizure of the animal. 
(3)  A statement that the animal is subject to forfeiture and humane destruction within three working days from the date the notice was sent.

The hearing shall be conducted in the same manner and with the same remedies and consequences as those set out in section 10-133. If the violation that is the basis of the seizure is found by the preponderance of the evidence to have occurred, the hearing officer shall have the authority to order the same remedies available in [sub]section 10-133(i) and (j). However, if forfeiture is ordered, the animal may be placed for general adoption to the public if it is healthy, nonaggressive, and has not bitten. If the animal's owner fails to contact the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency and request a hearing within the three days after the notice is sent, the animal shall be forfeited to the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency. 
(e)  Appeal. Appeal from a determination under this section shall be conducted in compliance with [sub]section 10-133(k).

(a)  Circumstances requiring special preventive measures. The Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency shall have the authority to require the owner or custodian of an animal to comply with specific preventive measures, as described in subsection (b) of this section, whenever the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency has the authority to seize the animal for possible forfeiture or when otherwise authorized by this chapter. Preventive measures shall only be ordered after taking into consideration the totality of the circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Nature of the particular animal. The behavior, size, temperament, breed, likelihood for inflicting serious injury, number of animals or other such similar factors that would be relevant to a determination of whether preventive measures need to be imposed for a particular situation; 
(2)  Adequacy of confinement. The adequacy of the current enclosure or confinement, if any; 
(3)  Immediate surrounding area. The likelihood that the conditions pertaining to the particular animal and the animal's confinement are detrimental to the safety or welfare of citizens or the peace and tranquility of citizens in the immediate surrounding area; 
(4)  History and ability. The history of the animal and the animal's owner in compliance or noncompliance with this chapter as well as the owner's ability to adequately restrain the animal when viewed in light of all relevant factors will be taken into consideration.

(1)  Appropriate, specific preventive measures which might include, but are not limited to, the following: necessary repairs for any fence or enclosure, measures to ensure that a gate will remain closed, a fence or secure fence as described in this subsection or any other similar device that would provide greater assurance for the confinement of the animal, all of which are subject to being specifically approved for their adequacy by the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency. A fence shall be at least a minimum of four feet high and shall constitute a secure-enough enclosure sufficient to contain the animal at all times. The minimum size of the enclosure may be at least 150 square feet. If the animal is over 15 inches at the shoulder or is deemed capable of climbing a standard four-foot fence, the animal control supervisor may require a six-foot fence. A secure fence means a fence, as immediately described above, that may also be enclosed on all six sides, including the top. The bottom must be concrete, unless the sides of the fence are buried one foot deep in a hard-packed soil. Any reference to "fence" or "secure fence" shall be defined as stated in this subsection. Preventive measures may also specifically include mandatory spay/neuter for any animal that has been declared dangerous by the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency. 
(2)  The owner to tattoo, or electronically tag, the animal at the owner's expense if that is necessary for identification, investigative or enforcement purposes. 
(3)  The owner to procure liability insurance in the amount of at least $100,000.00 at the owner's expense or to have the animal tattooed or to display a sign on the premises warning of the animal on the premises. The Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency shall have the authority to require the owner to show signed, written statements about maintaining the liability insurance, the designated enclosure for the animal and the duty to notify Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency if the animal escapes, and to require the owner to give the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency the authority to seize and impound the animal if the owner fails to comply with this subsection. 
(c)  Containment order. If the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency determines that specific preventive measures must be complied with by the owner of an animal, the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency shall make reasonable efforts to notify the owner of the containment order. All containment orders shall be in writing and shall state the reasons that preventive measures are required, shall identify the specific preventive measures that must be implemented, and shall state the designated time period within which to comply with the containment order. The Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency shall have the authority to exercise discretion for extensions of time if that is reasonable in view of the good-faith progress of the owner in implementing the preventive measures. 
(d)  Failure to comply with containment order. It shall be unlawful for an owner to fail to comply with a containment order within the designated time for compliance stated in the written order or any extension thereof. The penalty for a willful failure to comply with a containment order shall be a civil penalty in accordance with section 10-33 or seizure/forfeiture of the animal in accordance with sections 10-33 and 10-134.

The challenge must comply with all of the requirements as for a request for hearing as set out in section 10-133. A challenge that meets those requirements shall be heard in the same manner and with the same appeal to superior court as set out in section 10-133. The hearing officer shall review the containment order under the standards of this section but shall follow the process for the hearing as set out in section 10-133.

Sec. 10-136. - Fees. 
(a)  Generally. The Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency shall charge and collect fees from owners or possessors who redeem their animals. The following services and fees for those services are hereby authorized. The town board shall set the fee schedule for the following services and categories: 
(1)  Impounding. Any animal that is taken into custody by the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency pursuant to this code or state statute. 
(2)  Boarding. Dog per day, cat per day, large animals (e.g., equines, bovines, sheep, goat, swine, etc.) per day, small animals (e.g., rabbits, birds, poultry, hamsters, etc.) per day. Any animal not deemed to fit in a particular enumerated category shall be considered a large animal. 
(3)  Adoption. Large animals; dog, puppy, cat or other small animal; pick up a special service fee; replacement fee for metal tags. 
(4)  Electronic tagging. The Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency is hereby authorized to, and may without the consent of the animal's owner or possessor, humanely implant any animal lawfully impounded with an electronic tagging device similar to a micro-chip that will allow the animal to be positively identified. The cost shall be deferred by the owner or possessor prior to the animal being released back into their custody. 
    The fees shall be reviewed annually, and the town board will make such adjustments in fees as deemed appropriate. The town manager or his designee shall have the authority to establish animal categories and to recommend escalating impoundment fees for animals for recurring violations by the same owner. An accurate copy of the fee schedule shall be posted in a conspicuous place at the Davidson Police Department, and a copy shall also be filed with the town clerk's office. 
    The fees in this subsection do not include applicable charges for any license or inoculation that may be required by this chapter or other applicable law. If the animal to be redeemed is not licensed, permitted, or inoculated as required by law, the owner must have the dog or cat inoculated and obtain a proper license or permit before release of the animal. 
    No fees whatsoever shall be charged or collected on any animal which has been unlawfully impounded. Any such animal shall immediately be delivered upon demand to the owner or person entitled to the custody of the animal. 
    If the owner of a dog or cat pays for spay/neuter services for that person's animal impounded by the Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency before the release of the animal to the owner, the owner shall receive a $100.00 credit towards any redemption fees, including the impounding fee but excluding the electronic tagging fee, as stated in this subsection. 
(b)  Adoption requires animal spay/neuter surgery. The spay/neuter of an animal shall be a condition of adoption. 
    Surgery must be completed and proof of surgery submitted to the Davidson Police Department within 28 days of the adoption. 
    If the animal is not immediately eligible for spay/neuter surgery, the new owner shall enter into a contractual agreement to present the animal for surgery on a specific date determined by the treating veterinarian. Proof of surgery must be presented to the Davidson Police Department by the date set. If a person fails to return with proof that the animal has been spayed/neutered, that person will be charged with a misdemeanor and the animal will be impounded for forfeiture. 
    Further, the purchaser shall consent to the animal control shelter's right to seize such animal unless the purchaser immediately presents the animal for surgery at the spay/neuter clinic or can provide proof satisfactory to the animal control Davidson PD or the respective county animal control agency that the surgery has been performed by another veterinary clinic. If the animal control shelter seizes the animal upon the premises of the owner, the appropriate warrant for seizure shall be required.

Whenever a petition is filed with the inspector by a public authority or by at least five residents of the town charging that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, or whenever it appears to the inspector, upon inspection, that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, he or she shall, if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such dwelling or dwelling unit a complaint stating the charges and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the inspector at a place therein fixed, not less than ten days nor more than 30 days after the serving of said complaint. The owner and any party in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the time and place fixed in the complaint. Notice of such hearing shall also be given to at least one of the persons signing a petition relating to such dwelling.

The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the inspector. The owner and parties in interest shall also have the right to file with the inspector a written statement agreeing that the house referred to in the complaint is unfit for human habitation, that the housing should be demolished, agreeing that the town may have the housing demolished, and agreeing that the cost of demolition shall be a lien in the nature of a special assessment upon the property. In such cases, the inspector may proceed with the demolition without complying with the additional provisions of this section. 
(b)  Procedure after hearing. 
(1)  After such notice and hearing, the inspector shall state in writing his determination whether such dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, and, if so, whether it is deteriorated or dilapidated. 
(2)  If the inspector determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is deteriorated, he or she shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter, and improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this article within a reasonable specified period of time. Such order may also direct and require the owner to vacate and close such dwelling or dwelling unit until such repairs, alterations, and improvements have been made. Upon completion of required improvements, a new certificate of occupancy must be issued prior to subsequent leasing or sale of dwelling to a third party. Hardship cases may be handled by the inspector, recommending time or minimum requirement waivers to the town's board of adjustment, which body shall act on such recommendation. 
(3)  If the inspector determines that the dwelling is dilapidated, he shall state in writing his findings of fact to support such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to either repair, alter and improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this article, or else vacate and remove or demolish the same within a reasonable specified period of time. 
(c)  Failure to comply with order. 
(1)  Order by the board of commissioners after failure to demolish for one year. Whenever the inspector has issued an order ordering a dwelling to be repaired or vacated and closed pursuant to the provision of this chapter, and the owner has vacated and closed such dwelling and kept such dwelling vacated and closed for a period of one year pursuant to the order, the board of commissioners shall find that the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter, or improve the dwelling in order to render it fit for human habitation and that the continuation of the dwelling in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the municipality in that the dwelling would continue to deteriorate, would create fire and safety hazards, would be a threat to children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities, would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in that area and would render unavailable property and a dwelling which might otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent and affordable housing in this state; then in such circumstances, after the expiration of such one-year period, the board of commissioners may enact an ordinance and serve such ordinance upon the owner, requiring that the owner either: 
a.  Repair or demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days, if repair necessary to render the dwelling fit for human habitation would cost less than 50 percent of the present value of the dwelling; or 
b.  Demolish and remove the dwelling with 90 days, if the repair necessary to render the dwelling fit for human habitation would cost in excess of 50 percent of the present value of the dwelling. 
(2)  Such order shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the county and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. If the owner fails to comply with this order within the time fixed by such order, then the town manager or the inspector or their designees shall cause such dwelling to be repaired or demolished and removed pursuant to the order. 
(3)  In personam remedy. If the owner of any deteriorated dwelling or dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the inspector to repair, alter, or improve the same within the time specified therein, or if the owner of a dilapidated dwelling shall fail to comply with an order of the inspector to vacate and close, and remove or demolish the same within the time specified therein, the inspector shall submit to the board of commissioners at its next regular meeting a resolution directing the town attorney to petition the superior court for an order directing such owner to comply with the order of the inspector, as authorized by G.S. 160A-446(g). 
(4)  In rem remedy. After failure of an owner of a deteriorated dwelling or dwelling unit, or of a dilapidated dwelling, to comply with an order of the inspector within the time specified therein, if injunctive relief has not been sought or has not been granted as provided in the preceding paragraphs, the inspector shall submit to the governing body an ordinance ordering the inspector to cause such dwelling or dwelling unit to be repaired, altered, improved, or vacated and closed and removed or demolished, as provided in the original order of the inspector, and pending such removal or demolition, to placard such dwelling as provided by G.S. 160A-443 and section 14-117 of this article. 
(d)  Appeals from orders of inspector. 
(1)  An appeal from any decision or order of the inspector may be taken by any person aggrieved thereby. Any appeal from the inspector shall be taken within ten days from the rendering of the decision or service of the order, and shall be taken by filing with the inspector and with the town's board of adjustment, hereinafter referred to as "board", a notice of appeal which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the inspector shall forthwith transmit to the board all the paper constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When appeal is from a decision of the inspector refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a decision of the inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the board, unless the inspector certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant), a suspension of his requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than one days written notice to the inspector, by the board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. 160A-446(f) and subsection (e) of this section. 
(2)  The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have the powers of the inspector, but the concurring vote of four-fifths of the members of the board shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the inspector. The board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the ordinance, to adapt the application of the ordinance to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. 
(e)  Every decision of the board shall be subject to review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of the decision of the board, but not otherwise, as provided in G.S. 160A-446(e). In addition, any person aggrieved by an order issued by the Inspector or a decision rendered by the board shall also have the right, within 30 days after issuance of the order or rendering of the decision, to petition the superior court for a temporary injunction restraining the inspector pending a final disposition of the cause, as provided by G.S. 160A-446(f).

Sec. 30-31. - Findings and policy. 
(a)  The board of commissioners find as a fact that there are many parcels of land and vacant lots throughout the town which are overgrown with weeds and other noxious growth; have become a collection place for trash, garbage, debris, junk or other undesirable material; or have specific unattractive conditions located on them. The board of commissioners further finds as a fact that such conditions adversely affect one or more of the following: 
(1)  The safety of the citizens of the town; 
(2)  The general health and welfare of the citizens of the town; 
(3)  The health and safety of children who are attracted to such conditions; 
(4)  The quality of urban attractiveness and aesthetic appearance of the town; 
(5)  The protection of property values throughout the town; 
(6)  The preservation of the livability and attractiveness of neighborhoods; 
(7)  The opportunities for full economic development of the town; 
(8)  The comfort, happiness and emotional stability of occupants of property in the vicinity of unattractive conditions and nuisances; or 
(9)  The full use, ownership and enjoyment of property in the vicinity of such conditions. 
(b)  It is the policy of the town that each person is entitled to live in a community which is generally safe and free of conditions which adversely affect the general health and welfare of the community. Citizens also should have the right to live in an attractive community free of litter, garbage and unsightly junk especially when such conditions do not further individual rights or ownership of property. To protect against such conditions, the town intends to define, prohibit and restrain nuisances or to cause such nuisances to be removed from the town. The town manager shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this article. 
(Ord. No. 90-12, § 1) 
Sec. 30-32. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Nuisance means any condition or use of property, or any act or omission affecting the condition or use of property, which directly threatens the safety of citizens; adversely affects the general health, happiness, security and welfare of others; or is detrimental to the rights of others to the full use of their own property and their own comfort, happiness and emotional stability because of decreased property values, and the unattractiveness and livability of neighborhoods. Further, the board of commissioners finds and declares that the following specific conditions are prejudicial to the general health, safety and welfare of the town and its citizens; lessen the attractiveness and livability of the town; and, when located on any lot or parcel of land within the town limits, are a nuisance and therefore unlawful: 
(1)  Overgrowth or heavy growth of weeds, bushes, poison oak, poison ivy or other noxious vegetation or overgrowth of grass and weeds over ten inches in height; 
(2)  Conditions which have become or will become, if not corrected, a breeding ground or harbor for mosquitoes, snakes, rats or other pests;

(12)  A collection place for tree limbs, dried brush, dead vegetation or other rubbish; 
(13)  Any discharge into or polluting of any stream, creek, river or other body of water of any dangerous substance or any other material likely to harm the water or any vegetation, fish or wildlife in or along the water or the storage of such harmful materials and substances in a manner so that it is likely that such streams, creeks, rivers or other bodies of water will be polluted; or 
(14)  Any conditions or use of property which results in the emission of pollutants and particles into the atmosphere or causes noxious odors and stenches to be emitted into the air; or

(b)  Prior to ordering the removal of unattractive conditions which do not threaten the public safety or pose a general threat to the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the town, the town manager shall first determine that such conditions are visible from adjacent property or from a nearby street or highway and that the aesthetic benefits of removing or correcting the conditions outweigh the burdens imposed upon the private property owner. Such findings shall be based upon a balancing of the monetary loss of the apparent owner against the corresponding gain to the public by promoting or enhancing the community, neighborhood or area appearance, including protection of property values, indirect protection of public health and safety, preservation of the character and integrity of the community and the promotion of comfort, happiness and emotional stability of area residents.

(Ord. No. 90-12, § 8) 
Sec. 30-39. - Town abatement. 
(a)  Whenever the town manager has determined that a nuisance exists and given proper notice, the property owner, occupant or person in possession of the premises on which the nuisance is located may contract with the town to remove such conditions at a fee and upon such terms and conditions as the town manager may approve; except that as a condition of all such agreements, the landowner, occupant or person in charge of the premises shall release the town from any liability arising from or resulting from the removal of such conditions. 
(b)  Upon the failure of the property owner, occupant or person in possession of the premises to take the corrective action ordered by the town manager within the time specified, the town manager may remove, abate or remedy the condition that is dangerous or prejudicial to the public health or public safety; and the actual cost of the corrective action plus an additional fee of ten percent of the total cost with a minimum of $100.00 to cover the costs of notice and costs of collection shall be paid by the person in default. Provided that should the corrective action be the second or subsequent violation by the same person at the same location within 12 calendar months, the minimum additional fee shall be in an amount not less than $300.00.

(a)  Towing notice when name and address known. Except as set forth in subsection (d) of this section, an abandoned, nuisance or junked vehicle shall be towed only after notice to the registered owner or person entitled to possession of the vehicle. For a nuisance or junked vehicle, if the authorizing official can determine with reasonable diligence the names and mailing addresses of either the owner or person entitled to the possession of the vehicle or the owner, lessee or occupant of the real property upon which the vehicle is located, the notice shall be given by first class mail. The authorizing official shall retain a written record to show the name and address to which the notice is mailed, and the date mailed. 
(b)  Towing notice when name and address not known. If the name and address cannot be determined, or if the vehicle to be removed is abandoned, the authorizing official shall affix a notice on the windshield or some other conspicuous place on the vehicle. This notice shall state that the vehicle will be removed by the town on a specified date, no sooner than seven days after the notice is affixed. 
(c)  Towing stayed through appeal. If the person given notice appeals the removal, the removal shall be stayed until the appeal is decided. 
(d)  Exceptions to towing notice. The requirement for notice is waived where there is a special need for prompt action to eliminate traffic obstructions or to protect the public safety and welfare. Circumstances justifying the removal of vehicles without notice include the following: 
(1)  If the vehicle is abandoned on the street, or obstructing traffic, or illegally parked. 
(2)  If the protection of public health, safety or welfare requires prompt action. 
Such circumstances may, for example, include vehicles blocking or obstructing entries to businesses or residence, vehicles parked so as to pose a traffic hazard, and vehicles causing damage to property. For all vehicles towed without prior notice, the authorizing official shall keep complete records to document the decision to waive the notice requirement.

(c)  Time limit for notice. If the vehicle is registered in the state, post-towing notice shall be mailed within 24 hours of the towing. If the vehicle is registered in another state, post-towing notice shall be mailed within 72 hours of towing. 
(d)  Vehicles without registration. If the towed vehicle has no valid registration or registration plates, the authorizing official shall make a reasonable effort, including checking the vehicle identification number, to determine the last registered owner, and to notify him as specified in subsection (a). 
(e)  Post-towing hearing. After a vehicle is towed, the owner or other person entitled to possession is entitled to a hearing to determine if probable cause existed for removing the vehicle. A request for hearing must be filed in writing with the county magistrate designated by the chief district court judge to receive such hearing requests. The magistrate will set the hearing within 72 hours of receipt of the request, and the hearing will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 20-222. 
(f)  Redemption of the vehicle during proceedings. After towing, the owner may claim the vehicle by paying the towing fee and storage charges, or by posting a bond for double the amount of such fees to the towing business having custody of the removed vehicle. Upon regaining possession of vehicle, the owner shall not further violate this article.

ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 38-31. - Short title. 
    The regulations set out in this article shall be known and may be cited as the "Floodway Regulations of the Town of Davidson." 
( Ord. No. 95-1-10, § 1, 1-10-1995 ) 
Sec. 38-32. - Statutory authorization. 
    The state legislature has, in G.S. 143-215.51 et seq., 160A-360 et seq. and 160A-174, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the board of commissioners ordains the provisions of this article. 
( Ord. No. 95-1-10, § 2, 1-10-1995 ) 
Sec. 38-33. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 95-1-10, § 3, 1-10-1995) 
Sec. 38-34. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 95-1-10, § 4, 1-10-1995) 
Sec. 38-35. - Legislative intent. 
(a)  The regulations of the floodway district and flood fringe district set forth in this article, are intended to protect areas of designated floodplains subject to and necessary for regulating floodwaters, and to permit and encourage the retention of open land uses which will be so located and designed as to constitute a harmonious and appropriate part of the physical development of the town and county as provided in the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  The specific intent in establishing the floodway and flood fringe district includes the following: 
(1)  To control in flood hazard areas uses such as fill dumping, storage of materials, structures, buildings and any other works which, acting alone or in combination with other existing or future uses, would cause damaging flood heights and velocities by obstructing flows and reducing valley storage; 
(2)  To protect human life and health; 
(3)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(4)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(5)  To permit certain uses which can be appropriately located in flood hazard areas and to assure such permitted uses will not impede the flow of floodwaters, or otherwise cause danger to life and property at or above or below their locations along the floodway; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(7)  To provide sufficient drainage courses to carry abnormal flows of stormwater in periods of heavy precipitations; 
(8)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(9)  To meet the needs of the stream to carry floodwaters and protect the creek channels and floodplains from encroachment so that flood heights and flood damage will not be increased; 
(10)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
(11)  To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(c)  This article is intended to permit only that development within the floodplain which is appropriate in light of the probability of flood damage and presents a reasonable social and economic use of land in relation to the hazards involved. The regulations set forth in this article shall apply to all property located within the floodway district, and the floodway-fringe district as shown on the official flood areas map series. It is the intent of this article that these regulations combine with and qualify the zoning ordinance regulations for the zoning district in which such property is located. Any use not permitted by the zoning regulations shall not be permitted in the floodway district or the floodway-fringe district, and any use permitted by the zoning regulations shall be permitted in these districts only upon meeting conditions and requirements as prescribed in this article.

For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state and local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the town's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other evidence of compliance required in divisions 2 and 3 of this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result, except that variances can be issued for stream crossings which would not raise the base flood elevation level more than one foot. 
(g)  Conditions for variances are as follows: 
(1)  Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state or local laws, regulations or ordinances. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
a.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense; create a nuisance; cause fraud on or victimization of the public; or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(4)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(5)  The county engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

The following provisions shall apply within such areas: 
a.  1.  With the exception of stream crossings which would not raise the base flood elevation level more than one foot, no encroachment, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments, shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood level during the occurrence of a base flood, changes in floodway elevations, or floodway width. Such certification and technical data by a registered professional engineer shall be presented to the county engineer. 
2.  Any change which would cause a rise of more than one foot in the base flood elevation, or any change in the floodway elevation, or any change in the floodway width will require a variance and a conditional letter of map revision from FEMA. If approved and constructed, as-built plans must be submitted and approved by FEMA and a letter of map revision issued. A certificate of occupancy will not be issued without this letter of map revision.

ARTICLE III. - HISTORIC DISTRICT 

Sec. 58-51. - Preventing demolition by neglect. 
A.  Conditions of neglect defined and prohibited. Demolition by neglect is the destruction of a building through abandonment or lack of maintenance. In order to promote the preservation of the Historic District, owners shall maintain or cause to be maintained the exterior and structural features of their historic properties and not allow conditions of neglect to occur. The exterior features of any building or structure located within the local historic district shall be preserved by the owner or such other person who may have legal possession, custody, and control thereof against decay and deterioration and kept free from structural defects. The owner, or other person having such legal possession, custody, and control, shall upon written request by the town repair such exterior features if they are found to be deteriorating. Conditions of neglect include the following: 
1.  Deterioration of any exterior feature so as to create or permit the creation of any hazardous or unsafe conditions to life, health, or other property. 
2.  Deterioration of exterior walls, foundations, or other vertical support that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling. 
3.  Deterioration of flooring or floor supports, roofs, or other horizontal members that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling. 
4.  Deterioration of external chimneys that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling. 
5.  Deterioration or crumbling of exterior plasters or mortars. 
6.  Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs, and foundations, including broken windows or doors. 
7.  Defective protection or lack of weather protection for exterior wall and roof coverings, including lack of paint, or weathering due to lack of paint or other protective covering. 
8.  Rotting, holes, and other forms of decay. 
9.  Deterioration of exterior stairs, porches, handrails, window and door frames, cornices, entablatures, wall facings, and architectural details that causes delamination, instability, loss of shape and form, or crumbling. 
10.  Heaving, subsidence, or cracking of sidewalks, steps, or pathways. 
B.  Boarded up windows and doors prohibited; exceptions. Boarded-up windows and doors in areas in the historic district are prohibited with the following exceptions. Temporary exceptions to this standard can only be authorized by a certificate of appropriateness that is approved by the Design Review Board or by order of the inspector for a specific limited time period in order to protect the structure against further deterioration pending replacement windows, doors, or storefronts. All temporary boarded up windows which will remain for more than 30 days must be painted as specified and authorized by the certificate of appropriateness. Property owners in the historic district who currently have windows or doors boarded-up must have such windows and doors replaced pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness, within six months of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives. 
C.  Investigation of conditions of neglect. The town will designate an inspector to investigate petitions and make findings. 
D.  Petition and action. The Design Review Board or Planning Department may file a petition listing specific defects with the inspector requesting that he act under the following procedures to require the correction of deterioration or making of repairs to any historic landmark or significant structure located within the historic district so that such structure shall be preserved and protected in accordance with this ordinance. 
1.  Whenever a petition is filed with the inspector charging that a structure is undergoing demolition by neglect, the inspector (or a designated agent) shall, if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, within 15 days issue and cause to be served upon the owner and/or such other person who may have legal possession, custody, and control thereof, as the same may be determined by reasonable diligence, a complaint stating the charges and offering the owner the opportunity to meet in person with the inspector not less than 30 nor more than 45 days after the serving of such complaint. The owner and/or parties in interest shall be given a right to answer to give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint; the town shall also be given notice of the hearing; and that the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the inspector. The purpose of the hearing is to receive evidence concerning the charge of deterioration and to ascertain whether the owner and/or other parties in interest wishes to petition the board of adjustment for a claim of undue economic hardship. 
2.  If after such notice and hearing, the inspector determines that the structure is undergoing demolition by neglect because it is deteriorating, according to the standards of this section, the inspector shall state in writing the findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and/or other parties in interest therein an order to repair within the time specified those elements of the structure that are deteriorating, contributing to deterioration, or deteriorated. In the event that the owner and/or other parties in interest wish to petition for a claim of undue economic hardship, the inspector's order shall be stayed until after the planning board's determination in accordance with the procedures of subsection (e). 
E.  Methods of service. Complaints or orders issued by the inspector shall be served upon persons either personally or by registered or certified mail; but if the whereabouts of such persons are unknown and the same cannot be ascertained by the inspector in the exercise of reasonable diligence, and the inspector shall make an affidavit to that effect, stating the steps taken to determine and locate the persons in interest, then the serving of such complaint or order may be made by publishing the same once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper generally circulated within the city. Where such service is by publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises thereby affected. 
F.  Safeguards from undue economic hardship. 
1.  When a claim of undue economic hardship is made owing to the effects of this article, the inspector shall notify the board of adjustment within ten days following the hearing on the complaint. The board of adjustment shall schedule a hearing on the claim at its next regular meeting, within the limitations of its procedures for application deadlines. The petitioner shall present the information provided under subsection (1) to the board of adjustment. The board of adjustment may require that an owner and/or parties in interest furnish such additional information that is relevant to its determination of undue economic hardship. The board of adjustment may direct its staff to furnish additional information as the board believes is relevant such as findings from the Design Review Board. The board of adjustment shall also state which form of financial proof it deems relevant and necessary to a particular case. In the event that any of the required information is not reasonably available to the owner and/or parties in interest and cannot be obtained by the owner, the owner shall describe the reasons why such information cannot be obtained. 
2.  When a claim of undue economic hardship is made owing to the effects of this article, the owner and/or parties in interest must provide evidence during the hearing upon the claim, describing the circumstances of hardship. 
The minimum evidence shall include for all property:

b.  Financial resources of the owner and/or parties in interest. 
c.  Cost of repairs. 
d.  Assessed value of the land and improvements. 
e.  Real estate taxes for the previous two years.

h.  Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked, and offers received, if any. 
For income producing property: 
i.  Annual gross income from the property for the previous two years. 
j.  Itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two years, including proof that adequate and competent management procedures were followed. 
k.  Annual cash flow, if any, for the previous two years. 
3.  Within 60 days of the board of adjustment's hearing on the claim, the board of adjustment shall cause to be made a finding regarding the claim of undue economic hardship and shall enter the reasons for such finding into the record. In the event of a finding of no undue economic hardship, the planning board shall report such a finding to the chief building inspector. The chief building inspector shall then cause to be issued an order for such property to be repaired within the time specified. 
4.  In the event of a finding of undue economic hardship, the finding shall be accompanied by a recommended plan to relieve the economic hardship. This plan may include, but is not limited to, property tax relief as may be allowed under the North Carolina law, loans or grants from the city, the county, or other public, private, or non-profit sources, acquisition by purchase or eminent domain, building code modifications, changes in applicable zoning regulations, or relaxation of the provisions of this article sufficient to mitigate the undue economic hardship. The board of adjustment shall report such finding and plan to the inspector. The inspector shall cause to be issued an order for such property to be repaired within the time specified, and in accordance with the provisions of the recommended plan. 
G.  Appeals. Findings made by the inspector or by the design review board may be appealed to the board of adjustment. To perfect such an appeal, application must be filed by an aggrieved party with the board of adjustment within ten days following receipt of the order for repair of the property or determination. Appeals from the board of adjustment shall be in the nature of certiorari. 
H.  Other town or county powers. Nothing contained within this article shall diminish the town's or county's power to declare a building as unsafe or a violation of the minimum building code. 
I.  Penalties and remedies. Enforcement of this article may be by either one or more of the following methods, and the institution of any action under any of these methods shall not relieve any party from any other civil or criminal proceeding prescribed for violations and prohibitions. 
1.  Equitable remedy. The town may apply for any appropriate equitable remedy to enforce the provisions of this article. 
2.  Order of abatement. The town may apply for and the court may enter an order of abatement. An order of abatement may direct that improvements or repairs be made, or that any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with this article. Whenever the party is cited for contempt by the court and the town executes the order of abatement, the town shall have a lien, in the nature of a mechanic's and materialman's lien, on the property for the cost of executing the order of abatement. 
3.  Civil penalty. No civil penalty shall be levied unless and until the inspector (or a designated agent) shall deliver a written notice by personal service or by registered mail or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the person responsible for each violation indicating the nature of the violation and ordering corrective action. The notice shall also set forth the time period when corrective measures must be completed. The notice shall state that failure to correct the violation within the specified time period will result in the assessment of civil penalties and other enforcement action. If after the allotted time period has expired and after the hearing of any appeal by the board of adjustment, and no corrective action has been completed, a civil penalty shall be assessed in the amount of $50.00 per day of continuing violation. The fine will be allocated to projects in the historic district.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR PLANNING IN
DAVIDSON
The Town of Davidson will grow. We must insure that
its growth is beneficial to our existing citizens and
sustainable for future generations. Davidson must
remain a livable, healthy, vibrant community.
1. We must preserve Davidsons character and sense of
community.
The essence of Davidson is that residents know their
neighbors and interact with them in a variety of welldesigned
settings. This sense of community is enhanced
by:
 Compact developments with community open
space
 A street, sidewalk, and greenway network that knits
the community together
 Engaging public spaces
 A walkable and historic downtown
 Neighborhoods welcoming to all citizens
 Neighborhoods as integral parts of town
2. We must preserve and enhance Davidsons unique
downtown.
The presence of our cherished downtown has always
contributed to the quality of life of our residents. This

valuable asset will remain viable if we:
 Capitalize on its status as Davidsons social and civic center
 Encourage a mix of uses in each building
 Provide a variety of retail and services to meet citizens needs
 Provide compelling areas for citizens to congregate
 Strengthen existing businesses while encouraging new businesses
 Maintain its walkability and increase its bikability
3. We must encourage alternative means of active transportation.
The built environment can enhance the use of alternatives to the car and increase our
physical health. We will make it preferable to do some of lifes activities without driving
by:
 Development and redevelopment in walkable, mixed-use, connected
neighborhoods
 Planning commercial centers so walking, bicycling, and riding public transit to these
destinations are viable options
 New greenway, bike, and sidewalk connections to existing developments
 Creating streets that give preference to cyclists and pedestrians
4. We must use our scarce land resources wisely.
The natural environment enhances our quality of life, both physically and socially. We will
preserve this irreplaceable asset for future generations by:
 Preserving rural views, significant hardwood forests, farmland, wildlife habitats, rock
outcroppings, parkland, and watersheds in their pristine form
 Balancing natural habitat with active and passive recreational opportunities in our
preserved open space
 Encouraging development that uses green design, energy conservation, and flexible
spaces
 Ensuring that development builds up and not out
5. We must create an environment that fosters diversity.
We will create a community where all persons are welcome and are able to fully and
safely participate in community life. To encourage diversity of all economic levels, all

races and ethnic groups, all ages, and all physical and mental abilities we will:
 Provide a mixture of housing types and prices in every neighborhood
 Support our citizens who wish to age in place by employing universal design and
accessibility principles
 Encourage economic opportunities at all income levels and all abilities
 Preserve our cultural heritage
6. We must manage growth so the town can provide public facilities and services apace
with development.
Livability depends on the timely provision of transportation, schools, public safety,
utilities, commercial life, spiritual life, and job opportunities. It is our intent that all parts
of a vibrant, successful community grow together through:
 Establishment and maintenance of an adequate commercial tax base
 A healthy diversity of uses in walkable, compact neighborhoods
 Alternative transportation options between destinations
 Encouragement of economic growth without jeopardizing our sense of community
 Decisions based on the long-term goals of the comprehensive plan rather than a
short term benefit
7. We must enhance our quality of life through architecture and design.
Livable environments include well-designed buildings, a dynamic public realm, and
seamless connections between the two. This means that:
 Private buildings and public infrastructure must work together to shape public space
and to build community character
 We will preserve our historical assets
 The design of our public spaces, parks, and plazas will encourage social interaction,
cultural experiences, and recreational opportunities
 Public art will animate our civic spaces
Davidson is a livable and walkable community because we chose to rigorously manage
growth and to require excellent design. To preserve our high quality of life as the town
grows, and to ensure a sustainable future for generations, we must apply these planning
principles fairly and comprehensively.

2.1 GENERAL
2.1.1 PLANNING AREAS
In order to implement the purpose and intent of the
Planning Ordinance, planning areas are established
in this section. Planning areas are different from
conventional zoning districts in that they are defined
not by land use but by geographical areas related to
the historical and topographical patterns of growth
in the community and the Targeted Growth Plan from
the 2010 Davidson Comprehensive Plan. Therefore, we
have replaced the conventional terminology of Zoning
District with Planning Areas. These planning areas
have the same legal authority as zoning districts.
There are detailed provisions, uses, and standards for the
design of the built environment within each respective
planning area, including dimensional standards,
permitted building types, height, parking, lighting,
signage, permitted uses and other development
standards.
There are hereby established the following planning areas:
 Village Center (Section 2.2.1)
 Village Commerce (Section 2.2.2)
 Village Edge (Section 2.2.3)
 Village Infill (Section 2.2.4)
 Central Business District (Section 2.2.5)
 Lakeshore (Section 2.2.6)
 Neighborhood Center I (Section 2.2.7)
 Neighborhood Center II (Section 2.2.8)
 Neighborhood Services (Section 2.2.9)

 Special Use (Section 2.2.18)
2.1.2 OVERLAY DISTRICTS
An overlay district is a separate set of regulations applicable only to a specific geographic
area for the purpose of managing certain environmentally sensitive, culturally/
historically significant, and/or visually important community resources. An overlay
district may grant additional uses, restrict permitted uses, or impose development
requirements differing from those in the underlying planning area. The underlying
planning areas and overlay districts together will control development. Overlay district
designations are established below; in case of conflicting regulations, the stricter
regulation takes precedence.
There are hereby established the following overlay districts:
 Village Height Overlay
 Village Parking Overlay
 Village Infill Overlay
 Red

Orange
 Yellow
 Green

 Watershed Protection Overlay (Section 17)
 Floodplain Overlay (Section 18)
2.1.3 PERMITTED USES
Permitted uses are those activities which are allowed or allowed with additional
requirements in each planning area. Permitted uses are listed in the Use Table in the

 Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITS) Trip Generation Guide
2.1.4 BUILDING TYPES
Building types are used as a regulatory mechanism in this planning ordinance. Not all
building types are permitted in all planning areas. Additional design standards and
additional requirements for each building type are in Section 4, Site & Building Design
Standards.
Planning Areas I 2.1 General
Town of Davidson, NC D A V I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 2 - 5
Whether or not a building type is permitted or required in a specific planning area is
determined by the Building Type Table associated with the respective planning area. The
building type allowances in the Building Type Table shall be interpreted as:
P = Permitted
R = Required
DR = Permitted with approval of the Design Review Board
Building types not listed in the Building Type Table are presumed to be prohibited.
There are hereby established the following building types:
A. DETACHED HOUSE (ONE AND TWO-FAMILY)
Detached houses are the most predominant residential building type in Davidson.
Detached houses are suitable for single-family or two-family residences. They are
appropriate on a wide variety of lot sizes.
B. TOWNHOUSE
Townhouses are residential buildings with three or more dwelling units that share a
common wall. Each unit has its own entrance and is a minimum of two stories. Units
are typically aligned close to the public sidewalk, although sometimes there are small
variations in setback to provide landscaping or diversity in the streetscape.
C. ATTACHED HOUSE (TRIPLEX, QUADPLEX)
Attached houses have the outward appearance of detached houses but accommodate
three or four completely separate dwelling units within one building. They are
appropriate on a wide variety of lot sizes.
D. MULTI-FAMILY (APARTMENTS, CONDOMINIUMS, FLATS)
Multi-family buildings incorporate more than four dwelling units in a vertical
arrangement within one building. Common entrances and interior corridors serve
multiple units. These buildings are a minimum of two stories with parking typically
located behind the buildings or underground.
E. MIXED VILLAGE HOUSING (VILLAGE WALKUP, VILLAGE COURTYARD)
Mixed Village housing includes well-scaled buildings designed to fit within the context
of surrounding residential or mixed-use neighborhoods. These buildings are a minimum
of two stories, include a minimum of four to a maximum of eighteen units, feature
individual or shared entrances, and provide walkable access to nearby destinations for
multiple tenants. Examples of Mixed Village buildings include walkup and courtyard
dwellings.
F. LIVE/WORK
Live/work buildings are designed to combine commercial and residential uses within a
single building of two or more stories. They are similar to a townhouse, with a storefront
on the ground floor and a residential unit above. Storefront space may be a home-based
business or may be leased independently; however, different NC State Building Code
regulations apply in each case.
G. INSTITUTIONAL
Institutional buildings are used for public or semi-public purposes. These buildings
must be designed appropriately to fit within neighborhoods as integral parts of the
Planning Areas I 2.1 General
2 - 6 DAV I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 01.01.20
community. Their uses may include churches, libraries, post offices, and schools.
Institutional buildings serve as landmarks and places of assembly. They have a sense of
prominence within their respective neighborhoods.
H. WORKPLACE
The workplace building is designed to accommodate either single or multiple uses or
tenants with a wide range of internal activities in a single building.
I STOREFRONT
A storefront building is designed to accommodate either single or multiple uses
or tenants in a single building. A group of storefront buildings can be combined to
form a mixed-use center. For example, individual storefront buildings can provide
commercial uses with residential or office uses on the upper floors. They are a minimum
of two stories, typically are aligned adjacent to the public sidewalk and include a high
percentage of transparency in the ground level façade to encourage pedestrian activity.
J. ACCESSORY STRUCTURE
An accessory structure is an above-ground structure that is clearly and customarily
subordinate to a principal use or principal structure. An accessory structure is smaller in
area, extent, or purpose to the principal use or principal structure served.
2.1.5 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
The purpose of development standards is to establish criteria for the development,
redevelopment, construction, reconstruction, use, reuse, or subdivision of land within
the Town of Davidson planning jurisdiction. These standards serve as the foundation to
development but are not to be considered all-inclusive.
Minor variations from the development standards established in this ordinance may be
approved by the Planning Director based on environmental conditions of the site.

2.2.4 VILLAGE INFILL PLANNING AREA
A. DESCRIPTION
The Village Infill Planning Area comprises Davidsons traditional, residential
neighborhoods and provides for infill development surrounding the historic town
center. Streets, sidewalks and greenways in the Village Infill Planning Area must be
interconnected. A range of housing types is encouraged: For Master Plan projects on
lots over three acres a mix of at least two different building types is encouraged.
Additionally, small retail establishments are permitted on corner lots, with restrictions.
This encourages the provision of small-scale retail and service uses for surrounding
residential areas. Buildings are restricted in size to promote a local orientation, to be
pedestrian-oriented, to be compatible with the scale of surrounding residences, and to
limit any adverse impacts on residential development.
B. PERMITTED USES
The following table establishes the permitted uses for the Village Infill Planning Area.
Uses not listed in the table below are presumed to be prohibited. (See Section 2.1.3)

2.2.5 CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT PLANNING AREA
A. DESCRIPTION
The Central Business District Planning Area provides a balance of land uses with
higher density commercial activities, employment opportunities, and residential uses
at the gateway to Davidson from I-77. The purpose of this planning area is primarily
commercial development within a pedestrian-friendly neighborhood. Residential units
on upper floors are encouraged. This mixture of uses promotes walking, keeps spending
local, strengthening the local economy, and reduces dependence on automobiles by
creating a neighborhood with many different service and retail establishments in a small
area. Architectural design guidelines ensure an attractive and durable built environment
unlike typical interstate interchanges.
B. PERMITTED USES
The following table establishes the permitted uses for the Central Business District
Planning Area. For Uses not listed in the Use Table, please see 2.1.3. Additional

2.2.17 CONDITIONAL PLANNING AREA
A. DESCRIPTION
Because of the nature, scale, or location, or particular impacts on the immediate areas,
as well as the community as a whole, a Conditional Planning Area is established to
add flexibility to the planning and development process, but at the same time create
additional controls which can establish specific development standards to insure quality
development.
B. PURPOSE
Conditional Planning Areas may be established for the purpose of allowing innovative
planning or design ideas for development in any planning area.
In some instances, such development proposals may not be adequately accommodated
by the base planning areas. In accordance with NCGS 160A-382, 384 and 385 the
provisions set forth in Section 14 establish a legislative, conditional rezoning process for
property within the towns planning jurisdiction.
C. PROCEDURE
Conditional Planning Areas may be based on any district, but are not intended to relieve
hardships that would otherwise be handled using a variance procedure. A Conditional
Planning Area application must be made by the owners of the property or their
authorized agents in accordance with the procedures established in Section 15.
D. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
Within a Conditional Planning Area, petitioners may request modifications to the specific
standards of the underlying base planning area with the following exceptions:
If no specific request is made by the petitioner to the change in the development

2.3.1 OVERLAY DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED
An overlay district is a separate set of regulations applied to a specific geographic area
for the purpose of managing certain environmentally sensitive, culturally/historically
significant, and/or visually important community resources. An overlay district may
grant additional uses, restrict permitted uses, or impose development requirements
differing from those in the underlying base planning area. Where overlay districts are
applied, the underlying base planning are and the overlay district together will control
development. If there is conflict between the requirements of the base planning area
and the requirements of the overlay district, the requirements of the overlay district shall
take precedence. There are hereby established eight overlay districts as follows:
 VH-O: Village Height Overlay
 VP-O: Village Parking Overlay
 VI-O: Village Infill Overlay
 LH-O: Local Historic Overlay
 RF-O: Retail Frontage Overlay
 SB-O: Stream Buffer Overlay
 WP-O: Watershed Protection Overlay
 F-O: Floodplain Overlay
 SB-O: Scenic Byway Overlay
 NS-O: Neighborhood Services Overlay

A. PURPOSE
The Village Infill Overlay District is established to preserve the character of the older
parts of Davidson as defined by the Village Infill Overlay Districts. The towns historic
core cannot remain static, but its existing character is worth preserving. It is acceptable
for new houses to be larger than older ones, but not so much larger as to threaten
neighborhood character. Development in the Village Infill Overlay District should:
 Remind one of the surrounding neighborhood;
 Recognize the built environment;
 Have a human scale; and
 Preserve significant trees;

4.1 PURPOSE & INTENTION
The purpose of this chapter is to provide physical
standards and guidelines for site and building design.
Design regulations are not intended to replicate existing
built form or achieve a specific stylistic result, but to allow
imaginative design that respects the neighborhood context.
It is the specific intention of this chapter to ensure that
development:
 Is compatible with surrounding areas;
 Supports the unique visual character and
streetscapes in Davidson;
 Utilizes architectural styles which respect the
existing historic character of the town;
 Spatially defines streets, squares, and parks through
careful building placement and site design;
 Encourages walking by orienting buildings to public
streets, providing easy pedestrian connections, and
bringing activities and visually interesting features
closer to the street;

open space on a site is important factor in a successful pedestrian environment. To ensure
that the open space is well-used, it is essential to locate and design it carefully in accordance
with the following general standards:
 Urban open spaces shall be fronted by streets and buildings to encourage its use
and its safety.
 The space shall be located where it is visible and easily accessible from homes and
public areas (building entrances, streets, sidewalks).
 The space should be located to take views and sun exposure into account.
 The space shall be well-buffered from moving cars so that users can enjoy and relax
in the space.
 The space shall be visible from streets or internal drives, but should not be wholly
exposed to them.
 The space shall be partially enclosed with building walls, freestanding walls,
landscaping, raised planters, or on-street parking to help buffer it and create a
comfortable outdoor room.
 See Section 7, Parks and Open Space, for additional information.
I. Exceptions
Exceptions from the site and building design standards established in this section may be
approved by the Planning Director to preserve mature trees and natural features.
4.3.2 GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT IN EXISTING BUILDINGS
This section is intended to ensure the compatibility of infill development and redevelopment
to surrounding neighborhoods and shall apply to new construction and the expansion of
existing buildings. As a means to provide guidance for the design of buildings that integrate
well into the context of Davidson, this section identifies the following key features necessary
to ensure compatibility. When developing in the Village Infill Planning Area, in addition to
the standards below, see Section 2 for development in the Village Infill Overlay District.
D. Street Frontage: Street trees should be preserved.
E. Rhythm of Development along the Street: Established building rhythms along
street frontages should be continued. Larger buildings can be integrated into
smaller-scale neighbohrhoods by creating repetitive bays with facade articulation.
F. Building Orientation: Main entrances, and other primary building façade elements
should be oriented toward the street. Courtyard buildings should orient main
entrances toward courtyards that open to the street and serve as a semi-public
extension of the public realm.

Site & Building Design Standards I 4.4 General Building Design Requirements
4 - 6 DAV I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 01.01.20
as practical. Deep front setbacks can compromise the pedestrian realm.
H. Building Form: Massing, proportion, scale, setbacks, spaces between buildings, and
their relative positions should be used to integrate new development into existing
streetscapes.
I. Density: Density should increase closer to mixed use and commercial nodes.
J. Building Design: Buildings should be designed to respect the existing built
environment, but not be explicit reproduction of past historical styles.
4.4 GENERAL BUILDING DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
This section shall apply to all buildings, excluding the detached house, and accessory
structure building types. For requirements for these building types see Specific Building Type
Requirements, Section 4.5.
4.4.1 STANDARDS
The design of buildings should be complementary with prevalent architectural features
of the surrounding neighborhood, especially in areas where patterns established by
recurring architectural features are well-documented and valued.
A. Building Height
1. Building height, as established in each respective planning area in Section 2, is
measured as the number of stories in a building. A story is a habitable level in a
building.
2. The following elements shall not be calculated as stories:
a. Under-roof areas less than seven feet clear height with dormers.
b. Unoccupied residential attics less than seven feet above the eaves.
c. Raised basements less than four feet exposed at the lowest grade at the front
façade.

street to the ridgeline or the highest point of the roof (where there is no ridgeline),
excluding chimneys and basements, excepting raised basements described above.
Unless specifically stated elsewhere in this ordinance, the height requirements
established in this ordinance shall not apply to:
a. Building elements (such as church spires, belfries, cupolas, domes, parapets, etc.)
which are not intended for human occupancy;
b. Mechanical penthouses which are set back at least 20 feet from the front
elevation of the building.
4. This ordinance requires buildings, excluding detached and attached house building
types, to be at least two stories. The following exceptions are permitted:

buildings used in light manufacturing, sanctuaries, auditoriums, neighborhood
clubhouses, and gymnasiums may be one-story without liner buildings with
Planning Director approval.
B. Form and Massing
1. Franchise architecture, where buildings are stylized in an attempt to use the building
itself as advertising, is not permitted.
2. For large scale buildings, the front façade shall create repetitive bays, or the façade
shall be divided into an asymmetrical, yet balanced, composition.
3. Buildings on a corner or axial termini should be designed with additional height or
architectural embellishments to emphasize their location.
4. Building design shall take the natural topography of the site into consideration.
Construction techniques shall be used to have the least amount of impact on
sites with a slope greater than 15 percent. Examples of such techniques include
avoiding excessive cut and fill on site during construction, building into the slope
(if topography permits), terracing the building and site improvements to match
topography as closely as possible, and controlling water runoff.
5. Structured parking shall be screened in such a way that cars are not visible from the
sidewalk in front of the building. Locating structured parking at the interior of the
block surrounded by buildings is the preferred method.

5.1 GENERAL GOALS
The section is hereby adopted consistent with the goals
adopted by the Town Board as follows:
A. At any point in time, a minimum of 12½% of the
housing units in Davidson shall be affordable as defined
by this Ordinance.
B. The Town is willing to assist in the provision of
affordable housing in order to secure the benefits from a
diverse housing stock.
C. The owners/occupants of such affordable housing
will also participate in the provision of the affordable
housing, although the means of that participation will
vary with the method of its provision. For example,
the property owner may accept less-than-market rate
property appreciation or a tenant may accept fewer
amenities.
D. The Town, affordable housing providers, and developers
will employ a variety of tools to meet the affordability
goals, to match the characteristics of each project, to
fulfill the towns housing needs, to maintain the Towns
investment, and to eliminate substandard housing.
E. Affordable housing will be dispersed throughout the
Town.
F. The location of affordable housing should be supported
by pedestrian & bicycle facilities and public transit
that connect the owners/occupants to activity centers
that may include places for employment, shopping,
recreation, and/or education. It is acknowledged that
very low income individuals/families are statistically the
most transit- dependent population.

(2) or more residential lots or dwelling units, which includes the subdivision of an existing
lot which results in one or more lots.
A. Development Options
There are two options for the provision of affordable housing based on the number of
units proposed in the development that do not qualify as affordable units.
1. Seven (7) or Fewer Units
Developments with 7 or fewer residential units must either provide one affordable
unit or make a payment in lieu to the Town. The payment in lieu must be paid at the
time an application for a building permit on any of the lots or units is made. If the
payment is in lieu of providing a fraction of one unit, the calculation shall be prorated
as appropriate.
a. Subdivision to Evade Requirement Not Permitted
For purposes of determining whether an applicant may make a payment in lieu
pursuant to this subsection, all adjacent parcels under common ownership shall be

Section.
2. Eight (8) or More Units
Developments with 8 or more units shall provide all required affordable units in
accordance with Section 5.2.

of Section 5.
B. Compliance with this requirement shall be demonstrated as follows:
1. Master Plan
The applicant shall include notes on the Master Plan showing compliance with the
requirements of this section and indicating the total number and distribution of
required affordable units in accordance with Section 5.2 B.

representative of an approved affordable housing provider with the details described in
Section 5.3 B.
3. Final Plat
The Final Plat, as defined in Section 14.15.9, shall indicate which lots or units are to be
constructed as affordable units. Except as provided in Section 5.2.A.1, any payment in
lieu fees shall be paid to the Town prior to each final plat approval, for the affordable
units in that plat, unless otherwise specified in the affordable housing plan approved by
the Town.
C. Percentage and Distribution of Affordable Units
Required affordable housing units will be provided as follows.
1. General Requirement
Except as otherwise provided, 12.5% of the total number of residential units within any
development shall be affordable housing units and shall be located on the site of the
development.
2. Calculation
To calculate the number of affordable housing units, the total number of proposed
units, including the affordable units, shall be multiplied by 12.5%. If the product
contains a fraction, a fraction of .5 or more shall be rounded up, and a fraction of less
than .5 shall be rounded down, except as provided in Section 5.2.A.1.

list of households certified by the Town as eligible to purchase the unit. However,
a developer or property owner may select a low-income purchaser who is not on a
furnished list so long as the Town can verify that eligibility guidelines have been met,
as evidenced by the certificate of qualification, and that the unit is sold at an affordable
price as described in this Ordinance.
4. A non-eligible household may occupy an affordable unit if an eligible household is
not available to purchase or rent the unit on the date which is the later of 120 days
after the Towns receipt of the Notice of Availability or 60 days after the issuance of the
Certificate of Occupancy on the unit or if the unit is being resold, within 90 days after
the Towns receipt of the Resale Notice or if the unit is being offered for lease, within 60
days of the Towns receipt of the Release Notice.
5. A homebuyer education and counseling fee shall be paid by the developer to the
Town at the time of the closing of each affordable unit if the purchaser of the unit is
required to participate in homebuyer education and counseling services provided
through the Towns approved non-profit affordable housing provider.

Planning Director to be uninhabitable shall not be subdivided and platted for residential or
commercial occupancy, nor for such other uses as may increase danger to health, life or property
or aggravate a flood hazard. Such land shall be set aside for uses that are not endangered by
periodic or occasional inundation or that do not produce unsatisfactory living conditions.
6.5 CONNECTIVITY
Davidsons streetscape environments, from building face to building face are the primary public
spaces of the town. A well-connected street network improves mobility for town residents and
allows for convenient changes between different modes of transportation. The arrangement,
character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall be considered in their relation to
existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety,
and in their appropriate relation to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets.
Development shall be designed to provide attractive street fronts and ample pedestrian, bicycle
and vehicular connections in order to facilitate traffic movement, improve access/egress for
Davidsons residents, provide faster response time for emergency vehicles, and improve the
connections between neighborhoods.
6.5.1 STREET NETWORK
Streets shall interconnect within a development and with adjoining development
according to the following standards:
A. Minimum Access: A minimum of one means of vehicular access via a public rightof-
way shall be required for development sites and subdivided properties. Such
right-of-way shall conform to the minimum standards established in Section
6.7. Additionally, all master-planned development fronting on a state- or townmaintained
right-of-way must provide an internal street within the development.
B. Block Length: Blocks shall not be less than 150 feet nor more than 600 feet in length
except where topographic conditions and/or unique lot configurations offer no
practical alternatives. Such blocks shall be approved by the Planning Director prior
to final approval.
C. Cul-De-Sacs: Generally, cul-de-sacs are prohibited. Cul-de-sacs may be permitted
Subdivision & Infrastructure Standards I 6.5 Connectivity
Town of Davidson, NC D A V I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 6 - 5
only where topographic conditions and/or exterior lot line configurations offer no
practical alternatives for connection or through traffic. Cul-de-sacs, if permitted, shall
not exceed 250 feet in length from the nearest intersection with a street providing
through access (not a cul-de-sac). The closed end of a cul-de-sac shall not exceed 80
feet in diameter. A close (See Section 7) is preferred over a cul-de-sac.
D. Reserve Strips Prohibited: Reserve strips and non-access easements adjoining street
rights-of-way for the purpose of preventing access to or from adjacent property shall
not be permitted.
E. External Connections: Streets within a new development shall provide external
connections to existing streets and/or adjacent properties including adjacent future
phases at the rate of at least one connection/stub street per 600 feet of property
boundary. In addition, the following connections/stub streets shall be required:
1. Any connection to an existing stub street on an adjacent property;
2. Any connection/street stub, including water crossings, represented on a townaccepted
transportation or land use plan;
3. Street stub to an adjacent developable parcel of 20 acres or greater; and
4. Street stub to an adjacent parcel that abuts or is traversed by an existing or
proposed street.
F. Alternate Compliance
1. When the Planning Director deems a required external street connection is
impractical due to severe topography, existing development, or other natural
features, the town may require an easement or a non-vehicular connection in
lieu of the required street connection(s).
2. Funds in lieu of construction may be accepted for stub streets that would cross
over a water course located at the boundary of the development or a phase of
the development in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.12.1.C.
G. Future Street Connection Signage: All dead-end streets and stub streets that
have the potential to connect to adjacent property or with nearby streets must be
signed with the following language: The street will be extended when the adjacent
property develops.

shall intersect at less than 60 degrees.
B. Minimum Separation: All street intersections shall be at least 150 feet apart
measured from centerline to centerline.
C. Centerline Offsets: Street jogs with centerline offsets may be permitted only where
topographic conditions and/or exterior lot line configurations offer no practical
alternatives for through connections. Where a centerline offset occurs at an
intersection, the distance between centerlines of the intersecting streets shall not be
less than 80 feet.
D. Curb Radii: Curb radii at all intersections shall be rounded with a minimum radius
of 15 feet. At an angle of intersection of less than 90 degrees, a greater radius may
be required. Curb radii shall be designed to reduce pedestrian crossing times along
all streets. In general, curb radii should not exceed 25 feet. Street trees and on-street
parking shall be held 20 feet from all intersections to allow for the turning radius of
emergency vehicles.
E. Sight Distance: Appropriate size sight lines shall be maintained at all intersections
to maintain clear sightlines for pedestrians and motorists. Within the sight distance
triangle no fence, wall, sign (except regulatory and street name signs), embankment,
landscaping,or structure shall be placed, erected or maintained which will obstruct
visibility. The sight triangle may be modified by the Planning Director during the
review process.
F. Roundabout: Roundabouts are encouraged at intersections to allow a smooth and
continuous flow of traffic.

6.7.2 GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS
All streets in Davidson shall be designed as Complete Streets; they shall be sized and
detailed to serve equitably the needs of bicyclists, pedestrians, motorists, and transit
users. Streets shall be designed and constructed at a pedestrian scale by minimizing
design speeds, street width, and the number of vehicular travel lanes, as well as
incorporating bicycle and pedestrian facilities as a primary mode type.
A. Minimum Standards: All streets, whether publicly or privately maintained, shall
be constructed in accordance with the design and construction standards in this
ordinance and the Mecklenburg County Land Development Standards Manual.
B. Public Access: All streets shall be maintained for public access whether by easement
or by public dedication.
C. Topography: Streets, sidewalks, greenways and other pedestrian/bicycle facilities
shall be designed to fit the contours of the land to minimize grading and the use of
retaining walls, and shall minimize the removal of significant trees.
D. On-Street Parking: On-street parking shall be provided in accordance with the
applicable street type as specified in Section 6.7.3 - Town Street Classifications. If
angled parking is proposed, back-in angled parking configurations are preferred.
E. Centerline Radius: A 90-foot minimum radius and minimum 50-foot tangent shall
be provided between reverse curves on all streets.
F. Street Materials: Street and alley/lane materials shall conform to the provisions of
the Mecklenburg County Land Development Standards Manual. Exceptions may be
made by the Planning Director for pedestrian crosswalks in order to provide for a
safer crossing environment.
G. Curb Extensions: Curb Extensions (bulbouts) may be required by the Planning
Director where the crossing distance (pavement width) of a street is greater than 20
feet.
H. Street Signs and Traffic Control Signs
1. All street and traffic control signs shall be posted in accordance with the FHWA
- Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and installed by the
developer prior to the issuance of any certificates of occupancy for any building
on that street.
2. Additional wayfinding, pedestrian crossing, bicycle route, Share the Road, and/
or similar street signs may be required by the Planning Director as necessary, as
recommended in the Active Transportation Master Plan.
3. The text size and location of street signs shall provide for sufficient visibility in
accordance with the FHWA - Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD)
and the Mecklenburg County Land Development Standards Manual.
I. Traffic Calming Techniques: The use of traffic calming devices such as raised
intersections (speed tables), chicanes (lateral shifts), and roundabouts may be
required by the Planning Director depending on the nature of the street or
intersection. At all intersections requiring traffic calming, raised pavement or
roundabouts shall generally be used.

J. Posted Speed Limits: All streets, except alleys and state roads, shall be posted with a
25 mile per hour speed limit unless otherwise posted by the town or NCDOT.
EXAMPLE 6-3: TRAFFIC CALMING TECHNIQUES
Chicane: Chicanes calm traffic by requiring motorists to negotiate a slight lateral shift in the roadway. This is also an ideal technique for alternating an
on-street parking lane from one side of the road to the other.
Raised Intersection: Raised intersections or speed tables are elongated speed bumps used at intersections or for midblock crossings (as illustrated
above). They slow traffic and allow pedestrians to cross the street at the same grade as the sidewalk.

also be located as follows:
1. Wet Utilities (i.e., water, wastewater and stormwater) shall be located under the
vehicular travel lanes, near the street centerline.
2. Natural gas lines shall be located outside (i.e., further from the street centerline
than) the wet utilities, and may be located under the sidewalk as necessary.
3. Electric and cable conduit (i.e., phone and internet) shall be located outside
natural gas lines. In alley-loaded development, such utilities shall be located in
the alley. If no alley is provided, then such utilities shall be located behind the
sidewalk (if possible). Such utilities shall be located within the right-of-way or a
5-foot (minimum) public utility easement.
4. All utilities must be buried on site to the closest existing utility connection in the
right-of-way. No new utility poles may be installed.
L. Curb and Gutter
1. Drainage shall be provided using standard (two-foot) closed curb and gutter
systems along all streets with the exception of rural roads and alleys. Parkways
may use open swales on the park/greenway side upon approval of the Planning
Director. Valley curb and gutter are prohibited. Alleys shall use ribbon curb.
2. Standard curbing is also required along any side of a street with marked onstreet
parking.
M. Drainage Grates: All drainage grates must be safe for bicyclists. Bicycle-safe drainage
grates are Types E, F, and G as approved by NCDOT. Nonconforming drainage grates
must be replaced by the fronting development.

sections for the purposes of identifying required improvements by fronting property
owners in development applications. All streets, public or private, shall comply with one
of the street sections established in this section.
Certain corridors feature special characteristics and warrant the application of specific
infrastructure standards. Many of these corridors lie within the Towns rural areas. All new
development fronting Grey Rd., Davidson-Concord Rd., East Rocky River Rd., and Shearer
Rd., shall conform to the street cross-sections as specified in the Rural Area Plan.

on both sides of the street unless otherwise determined by the Planning Director. In
select cases sidewalks may be provided on only one side of each minor street and
ADA-compliant paths meeting the minimum DPO standards for sidewalk width may
be provided on one side of each street. All walkways shall be publicly-accessible.
6.8.2 MULTI-USE PATHS
For the purposes of this chapter, multi-use paths shall be classified in accordance with
their relation to designated floodplain areas. Additional restrictions may apply within the
Streamside, Managed Use and Upland Zones of required Stream Buffers in accordance
with the requirements established in Section 21.
A. Upland Trails: Upland multi-use trails are positioned completely outside designated
floodplains. The existing vegetation in the Streamside and Managed Use Zones shall
remain intact. Upland trails are preferred over other greenway types because they
provide the most habitat and water quality benefits.
B. Floodplain Trails: These multi-use trails are positioned outside of the floodway,
within the floodplain. A significant vegetative buffer between the stream and
trail should be left intact. Such trails should only be utilized where site conditions
prohibit the use of Upland Trails.

them from on-street parking lanes and vehicular travel lanes.
6.10 TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS
A Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) is a specialized study that evaluates the effects of a
developments traffic on the surrounding transportation infrastructure. The TIA helps identify
where the development may have a significant impact on safety, traffic and transportation
operations, and provides a means for the developer and government agencies to mitigate
these impacts. Ultimately, the TIA can be used to evaluate whether the scale of development
is appropriate for a particular site and what improvements may be necessary, on and off the
site, to provide safe and efficient access and traffic flow.
6.10.1 APPLICABILITY

6.11 IMPROVEMENT GUARANTEES
6.11.1 ALTERNATIVES TO COMPLETION OF INFRASTRUCTURE
In lieu of meeting the requirement for the completion, installation and dedication of
any and all public infrastructure improvements (e.g., water, sewer, streets, sidewalks,
storm drainage, trees, supplemental buffer plantings, street lights, etc.) prior to final plat
approval for subdivisions or Certificate of Occupancy for site plans, the Town of Davidson
or its authorized agent may enter into a written agreement with the developer whereby
the developer shall agree to complete all required improvements. Once this agreement
is signed by both parties and the financial security required herein is provided, the final
plat or Certificate of Occupancy may be approved by the Planning Director, if all other
requirements of this ordinance are met. To secure this agreement, the developer shall
provide either one, or a combination of the following guarantees:
A. Surety Performance Bond(s): The developer shall obtain a performance bond(s)
from a surety bonding company authorized to do business in North Carolina, and
approved by the Board of Commissioners or its designee. The bond shall be payable
to the Town of Davidson (or its authorized agent) and shall be in an amount equal to
1.5 times the entire cost, as estimated by the developer and verified by Mecklenburg
County, of installing all required improvements. The duration of the bond(s) shall
be until such time as the improvements are built according to applicable standards
and a roadway maintenance bond is posted, although portions of the bond may be
released according to Mecklenburg County procedures. Any expenses associated
with the cost verification by the town shall be paid entirely by the developer.
B. Cash or Equivalent Security: The developer shall deposit cash, an irrevocable
letter of credit or other instrument readily convertible into cash at face value, either
with the town (or its authorized agent) or in escrow with a financial institution
designated as an official depository of the town. The amount of deposit shall be
equal to 1.5 times the entire cost, as estimated by the developer, and verified by
Mecklenburg County, of installing all required improvements. If cash or other
instrument is deposited in escrow with a financial institution as provided above,
then the developer shall file with the Town of Davidson (or its authorized agent) an
agreement between the financial institution and the developer guaranteeing the
following:
1. That said escrow amount will be held in trust until released by the Town of
Davidson and may not be used or pledged by the developer in any other
transaction during the term of the escrow; and
2. That in case of a failure on the part of the developer to complete said
improvements, the financial institution shall, upon notification of the town to
the financial institution of an estimate of the amount needed to complete the
Subdivision & Infrastructure Standards I 6.11 Improvement Guarantees
Town of Davidson, NC D A V I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 6 - 2 9
improvements, immediately pay to the town the funds estimated to complete
the improvements, up to the full balance of the escrow account, or deliver to the
town any other instruments fully endorsed or otherwise made payable in full to
the town.
C. Funds in Lieu of Construction: At the option of the developer and with the consent
of the Board of Commissioners, a developer may, in lieu of the construction of the
portion of a street which crosses over a water course located at the boundary of the
development, deposit with the town the sum sufficient (in the towns determination)
to construct such portion of the street. If the actual cost of the bridge exceeds the
towns determination, the developer will not be required to provide additional funds
nor will a refund be made if the actual cost is less than the original determination.
This option shall not be available when such street connects to an existing street
at the boundary of the development or serves as a necessary means of access to
a lot within the new development. Funds may be paid in lieu of construction of
improvements for Minor Subdivisions, as established in Section 14, upon approval of
the Planning Director.
6.11.2 DEFAULT
Upon default, meaning failure on the part of the developer to complete the required
improvements in the time required by this ordinance, if any, or as specified in the
performance bond or escrow agreement, then the surety, or financial institution holding
the escrow account, shall, if requested by the town, pay all or any portion of the bond
or escrow fund to the Town of Davidson up to the amount needed to complete the
improvements or make emergency repairs based on an estimate by the town. Upon
payment, the town, at its discretion, may expend such portion of said funds, as it deems
necessary to complete and maintain all or any portion of the required improvements.
The town may also use said funds to make emergency repairs. The town has not
accepted the improvements for maintenance by completing the work or making
emergency repairs. Upon final completion of the improvements and acceptance by
resolution of the improvements by the town for maintenance, the town shall return to
the developer any funds not spent in completing and maintaining the improvements.
In the event the bond, letter of credit, or other financial security is insufficient to pay for
the completion and maintenance of the improvements, the developer shall pay to the
town the total amount of the insufficiency and, if the town is not paid, the amount of
the insufficiency shall constitute a lien of the property in favor of the town. Failure of the
developer to maintain the performance bond, letter of credit, or other instrument readily
convertible into cash at face value, and any required increases thereto, as mandated by
this ordinance, is a default and the town may, in addition to the above remedy, withhold
building permits until such time as the developer is in compliance.

Easements shall be conveyed to the town or other appropriate agency for underground
and overhead utility installation, stormwater drainage, pedestrian/bicycle access,
and other purposes as required by the town and the Mecklenburg County Land
Development Standards Manual. Easements shall be centered along front, rear or side
lot lines, except that easements for watercourses and drainage channels shall conform
to the lines of such watercourse. The minimum width for easements shall be determined
by the Planning Director according to the number of utilities placed within an easement
area, the depth of utilities, the requirements for access, and other related factors, in order
to ensure enough space for their future maintenance.
6.12.2 RESERVATION OF SCHOOL SITES & OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS
A. Previously Designated School/Public Building Sites: If the Mecklenburg County
Board of Commissioners or the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education have
determined the specific location and size of any school site or other public building
to be reserved, and if this information appears in any Comprehensive Plan over
which other local governments have jurisdiction, the Planning Director shall
immediately notify the appropriate authority if all or part of the reserved location
is included in a proposed subdivision. The responsible authority shall promptly
decide whether it still wishes the site to be reserved. The responsible authority shall
then have 18 months, beginning upon the date of master plan approval, within
which to acquire the site by purchase or by condemnation as provided in NCGS
160A-372. If the Town Board of Commissioners, the Board of Education, or any other
local government having jurisdiction has not purchased or begun proceedings to
condemn the site within 18 months, the developer may treat the land as freed from
reservation.
B. New School/Public Building Sites for Large Developments: If the total size of a
proposed development exceeds 200 acres or 500 housing units, the developer shall
reserve for future purchase a minimum of 5 usable acres in prominent sites for the

7.5 OPEN SPACE STANDARDS
7.5.1 STANDARDS FOR ALL OPEN SPACE
The location, nature, configuration, and use of the open space shall be determined by
the following regulations and criteria:
A. Location
1. Primary Conservation Areas: Primary conservation areas have been determined
as inappropriate for development because they contain stream buffers, flood
plains, or slopes greater than 20 percent. Dedication of open space shall include
all primary conservation areas, and designate any additional open space for
preservation as necessary to attain the minimum required percentage of open
space.
2. Additional Open Space: Additional required open space may lie within other
protected areas as designated in Sections 17 - 21 (Environmental Protection
Regulations) or elsewhere in this ordinance, but shall be subject to all applicable
provisions of this ordinance as well as any applicable State or Federal regulatory
jurisdiction. The following criteria should be considered in the conservation of
open space beyond primary conservation areas:
a. Proximity or relationship to other open space within or outside the proposed
development;
b. The presence of significant natural features (rock outcroppings, forests,
ponds, streams, upland areas, etc.), viewsheds, wildlife habitats, trails, and/or
community farms and gardens.
c. Land within 600 feet of either side of the following water courses: The Rocky
River; West Branch of the Rocky River; and, the West Branchs main tributary
(from north of Grey Rd. to its intersection with the West Branch).
3. Non-Contiguous Open Space Areas: The open space requirement for
a development may be met by property that is not contiguous with the
development, nor owned by the applicant, as long as a 10 percent minimum
requirement for open space is met on-site and the non-contiguous property
is approved by the Planning Director. The Planning Director will consider the
following factors in approving/disapproving the use of non-contiguous property
to meet the minimum open space conservation requirement:
a. Size and location of utility and/or road right-of-ways on the property;
b. Legal or practical restrictions to the development of the property;
c. Size of the property;
d. Location of the property in relation to roads or other open space;
e. The number of non-contiguous properties proposed; and
f. Environmental conditions on the property.
4. Utility Easements: Easements for overhead public utility transmission lines shall
not be considered for required open space areas.
5. All open space must be publicly-accessible unless the lands biological features

and conservation values as determined by the Planning Director or their
designated administrator are deemed to require protection.
7.6 OWNERSHIP & MAINTENANCE
7.6.1 OWNERSHIP OF PARKS & OPEN SPACE
A. Permitted Ownership Entities: Parks and open space shall be separately deeded to
one of the following:
1. The Town of Davidson (upon acceptance by the Board of Commissioners),
2. Mecklenburg County,
3. A non-profit land trust or conservancy,
4. A homeowners association, or
5. A private owner.
B. Ownership Conditions
1. Non-public ownership strategies (i.e., ownership by non-profit land trust
or conservancy, a homeowners association, or a private owner) must be
accompanied by a long-term maintenance plan. Management plans must be
consistent with LTA Standards & Practices and deemed to be financially viable by
the Town Attorney or their designated administrator. Plans must be approved
and contracts, easements, funds, etc. established prior to issuance of any Final
Plat approval by the Town of Davidson.
2. Ownership by a non-profit land trust or conservancy must be recorded by
contract in a form approved by the town
3. Ownership by a homeowners association or private owner must be
accompanied by a permanent conversation easement placed upon the
land. Each conservation easement must be accompanied by a stewardship
endowment properly funded by the developer, consistent with the Land Trust
Alliance (LTA) standards, and held by the conservation easement holder. At
a minimum the endowment must cover annual monitoring, reporting, and
maintenance costs to achieve Level I Stewardship Costs consistent with LTA
standards and practices. See the LTAs Determining Stewardship Costs Manual and
LTAs Standards & Practices for further information.

8.1 PURPOSE & INTENTION
Parking lots and similar facilities are necessary elements in
the urban environment. While it is expected that on-street
parking will contribute substantially to parking needs,
sufficient off-street parking must also be provided to serve
the particular needs of the building(s).
The purpose of this section is to ensure that development in
Davidson:
 Provides adequate parking without degrading the
urban or natural environment;
 Limits curb cuts which interrupt the continuity of the
streetscape environment and the pedestrian walking
experience;
 Uses internal streets and alleys to access centrally
located, shared parking lots or structures with one
entry/exit per block face;
 Incorporates permeable parking surfaces and porous
pavement to reduce stormwater run-off.

8.3.2 EXCEPTIONS TO PARKING REQUIREMENTS
A. Requirements for construction of off-street parking in the Parking Overlay District
may be met through payments in lieu in accordance with Section 8.3.3. Bicycle
parking is still required.
B. In the Village Center, Village Edge, and Village Commerce Planning Areas , existing
buildings which were legally constructed without the provision of on-site motor
vehicle parking and infill housing on existing lots of record may meet requirements
with on-street motor vehicle parking and will be construed as conforming to
parking. Such buildings are eligible for change of use permits for building upfits
and expansion. Bicycle parking will not be required unless the existing site is
redeveloped.
C. Detached, attached, mixed village, and townhouses building types may meet or
contribute to meeting motor vehicle parking requirements with on-street parking
if abutting portion of the fronting street is designed to meet the parking needs of
the residential buildings. Existing residential buildings will not have to add bicycle
parking unless the site is redeveloped.
D. Where motor vehicle access is provided between adjoining non-residential sites
and the operating hours of adjoining uses do not significantly overlap, the uses
may share up to 50 percent of required parking spaces. Shared use of motor vehicle
parking shall be guaranteed by a contract or other legally binding document. Bicycle
parking may be provided in a common area for adjacent properties as long as the
parking facility is no further than 50 feet from any main entrance.
E. Off-site parking is allowed wherever Parking as a Principal Use is permitted by
Section 2. Off-site parking must be 1/4 mile or less, measured along the pedestrian
access route, from the primary structure requiring the parking.
8.3.3 PAYMENTS IN LIEU
Payments in lieu of parking may be provided for development in the Parking Overlay
District as described in Section 2 according to the Schedule of Fees/Payments adopted
by the Board of Commissioners. Such payment shall be made prior to the issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy.
8.4 PARKING LOT DESIGN STANDARDS
8.4.1 GENERAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES
Off-street parking areas should be designed to minimize breaks in the pedestrian
environment along the public street and create safe and comfortable passage for
pedestrians. The following standards shall therefore be met.
A. Curb cuts must be minimized in width and number.
B. Parking lots shall be placed behind buildings. Parallel parking is allowed on one side
of the access drive to the rear parking area. Off-street parking is not permitted in
front of the primary building façade, except where specified in an adopted street
section or detailed as a public plaza or square. Notwithstanding the parking location
requirements below, any property located at a street intersection shall not have
Parking & Driveways I 8.4 Parking Lot Design Standards
8 - 4 DAV I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 08.22.17
parking, loading, or service areas at the corner.
C. Uninterrupted areas of parking lot shall be limited to 36 spaces. Large parking lots
shall be broken by buildings and/or landscape features.
D. To maintain pedestrian comfort and calm the speed of entering traffic, driveways to
parking areas should not exceed 24 feet in width (two lanes) or 12 feet in width (one
lane), except those with turn lanes required by the Town of Davidson.
E. Adjoining parking lots serving non-residential and multi-family buildings shall be
interconnected (see section 8.4.9).
F. Parking, loading, and other vehicular access shall occur at mid-block of secondary
streets or via an alley, to the extent practical.
G. Parking areas shall not abut pedestrian-oriented street intersections or institutional
buildings, be adjacent to squares or parks, or occupy lots which terminate a vista.
H. Off-street parking areas shall be designed to facilitate adequate movement and
access by sanitation, emergency, and other public service vehicles without posing a
danger to pedestrians or impeding the function of the parking area.
I. Off-street parking areas shall be designed so that parked vehicles do not encroach
upon or extend onto public rights-of-way, sidewalks or strike against or damage any
wall, vegetation, utility, or other structure.
J. All paved parking areas shall be curbed using a standard curb with a minimum
width of 1.5 feet. Curb inlets may be used to permit sheet flow drainage into rain
gardens or other bioretention areas as part of an alternative engineered storm water
retention system.
K. All parking lots, regardless of surfacing, shall retain stormwater on site or drain to a
catch basin in a public street. Low impact stormwater management devices (such
as pervious paving, bioretention areas, vegetated landscape islands, and the use
of absorbent landscaping) are encouraged for all parking areas. In parking lots of
more than 100 spaces, the stormwater from all spaces over 100 shall be conveyed to
low impact stormwater management devices on site, as approved, by the Planning
Director. Parking areas should be organized to provide consolidated landscape areas
as opportunities for passive stormwater management.
L. Parking may not interfere with sightlines for vehicles or pedestrians. No on-street
parking shall be permitted within 25 of a designated pedestrian crosswalk.
M. Suitable paving materials for off-street parking areas include, but are not limited to,
asphalt, porous asphalt, concrete, porous concrete and paving blocks (See Section
8.5.6).
N. See Section 8.7 for additional standards regulating driveways to off-street parking
areas.
8.4.2 STRUCTURED PARKING
A. When above-ground structured parking is located on a road right-of-way, the first
two floors adjacent to the right-of-way shall be lined with a permitted building type
Parking & Driveways I 8.4 Parking Lot Design Standards
Town of Davidson, NC D A V I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 8 - 5
for the planning area in which it is located. If the structured parking fronts multiple
rights-of-ways or pedestrian ways, the Planning Director may determine a hierarchy
and the extent to which buildings shall line each.
B. All structured parking should be screened so as not to be visible from a public
street or park/open space. Locating structured parking at the interior of the block,
surrounded by buildings, is the preferred method.
EXAMPLE 8-1: STRUCTURED PARKING CONFIGURATIONS
Parking Garage Retail Screen: A ground floor retail liner in
a parking garage creates an appropriate streetscape environment by
screening the parking areas behind.
Parking Garage Preferred Location: Locating structured
parking at the interior of the block, surrounded by buildings, is the
preferred method.
8.4.3 PARKING SPACE DIMENSIONS
Dimensions for standard parking spaces, parallel parking spaces, and spaces designed
for the disabled shall be designed in accordance with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land
Development Standards Manual.
8.4.4 PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING & SCREENING
See Section 9 Tree Preservation, Landscaping & Screening for parking lot landscaping
requirements.
8.4.5 PEDESTRIAN ACCESS
Parking lots shall be designed to allow pedestrians to safely move from their vehicles to
the building. On small lots (thirty-six spaces or less), this may be achieved by providing
a sidewalk at the perimeter of the lot. On larger lots, parking rows shall be oriented
perpendicular to the main building entrance(s) and corridors within the parking area
should channel pedestrians from the car to the perimeter of the lot or to the building.
These corridors shall be delineated by a paving material that differs from that of
vehicular areas and planted to provide shade. The use of small posts or bollards are
encouraged to provide additional separation of pedestrian and vehicular corridors.

8.4.6 VEHICULAR ACCESS
A. Parking, loading, and other vehicular access should occur at mid-block of secondary
streets or via an alley wherever possible.
B. See Section 8.7 for additional standards regulating driveways to off-street parking
areas.
8.4.7 PARKING LOT CONNECTIONS
Adjoining parking lots serving non-residential and multifamily uses shall be
interconnected according to the following standards:
A. At least one connection stub shall be provided at all lot lines that are coincident for
at least 60 feet.
B. All connection(s) shall be at least 20 feet wide and permit two-way vehicular
circulation.
C. The connection(s) shall align with any previously established connection(s) on an
adjacent property.
D. The connection(s) shall have a slope of no greater than 15 percent.
E. The connection(s) shall not be placed where a building on an adjacent property
would hamper traffic movements within the parking lot.
F. The connection(s) shall be placed in an area which will not require the removal of
significant natural features such as wetlands or trees with a caliper of 6 inches or
more.
G. An easement for ingress and egress to adjacent lots through the connection(s) shall
be recorded by the property owner with the Mecklenburg County Register of Deeds
Parking & Driveways I 8.4 Parking Lot Design Standards
Town of Davidson, NC D A V I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 8 - 7
in the form of an easement plat.
H. In the event these conditions create an undue hardship, or if such connections
would create undesirable traffic flow, the Planning Director may modify or adjust the
connection requirements as appropriate.
EXAMPLE 8-3: PARKING LOT CONNECTIONS
Parking Lot Connections: Adjoining parking lots serving non-residential and multifamily uses must be connected.
8.4.8 PAVING MATERIALS & STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
A. Suitable paving materials for off-street parking areas include, but are not limited
to, asphalt, porous asphalt, concrete, porous concrete and paving blocks. Overflow
parking (i.e., off-street areas used for special event parking and/or to accommodate
occasional overflow volumes) may be constructed of any dust-free compacted,
pervious ground cover. The owner of the property shall be responsible for the
maintenance of such parking in a clean and dust-free condition. Grass and mulch are
examples of acceptable pervious ground cover for overflow parking areas.
B. All parking lots, regardless of paving materials, shall retain stormwater on site or
drain to a catch basin in a public street. Low impact stormwater management
devices (such as pervious paving, bioretention areas, vegetated landscape islands,
and the use of absorbent landscaping) are encouraged for all parking areas. In
parking lots of more than 100 spaces, the stormwater from all spaces over 100 shall
be conveyed to low impact stormwater management devices on site, as approved
by the Administrator.
C. Parking areas should be organized to provide consolidated landscape areas as
opportunities for passive stormwater management.
D. All paved parking areas shall be curbed using a standard continuous curb with a
minimum width of 1.5 feet. Curb inlets may be used to permit sheet flow drainage
into rain gardens or other bioretention areas as part of an alternative engineered
storm water retention system.
E. Where installed, bioretention areas should be appropriately designed and located to
filter, store and/or convey the expected stormwater flows from surrounding paved
areas. The use of perforated subdrains, drought-tolerant plant species, check dams,
Parking & Driveways I 8.5 Parking standards for Detached House, Attached House Townhouse, and Live Work building Types
8 - 8 DAV I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 08.22.17
overflow catch basins, appropriate planting mediums and soil amendments may be
required for bioretention areas to function correctly.
EXAMPLE 8-4: BIORETENTION AREAS WITHIN PARKING LOTS
Bioretention Areas in Parking Lots: The use of bioretention areas and pervious pavement is encouraged in all off-street parking areas.
When bioretention areas are useed, curb inlets, perforated subdrains, overflow catch basins and appropriate plant species should be utlized to ensure the
bioretention area functions correctly.
8.5 PARKING STANDARDS FOR DETACHED HOUSE, ATTACHED HOUSE
TOWNHOUSE, AND LIVE WORK BUILDING TYPES
In addition to the Parking Location restrictions of Section 8.4, the following standards
shall apply to garages and off-street parking areas for Detached House, Attached House,
Townhouse, and Live Work building types (as defined in Section 2):
A. Lots of 60 Feet or Less in Width: Alleys are required. Garages or off-street parking
areas shall be accessed only from an alley. Driveways shall not be permitted to
connect to the fronting street. Where topographic or unique site conditions preclude
the use of an alley, as determined by the Planning Director, a driveway of no more
than 12 feet in width may be used to provide access to garages.
B. Lots More than 60 feet in Width
1. If the street side elevation of an attached garage is side-loaded (i.e., oriented at
least 90 degrees to the street), the attached garage may be flush with the front
building facade. In all other conditions, the garage must be recessed 10 feet
behind the plane of the main building facade.
2. For attached house building type, a maximum of 1/3 of the linear dimension of
the front facade of an individual unit may be garage.
3. For Detached House building type, the maximum width of a front-loaded garage
shall be 25 feet.

Town of Davidson, NC D A V I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 8 - 9
C. General Standards for All Lots
1. Only one curb cut shall be permitted per residential unit.
2. The maximum curb cut for a driveway shall be 12 feet wide. Driveways may
widen, if necessary, to a maximum of the garage width.
3. Alley-accessed garages shall be setback 15 feet from the alley centerline.
8.6 BICYCLE PARKING STANDARDS
8.6.1 GENERAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES
All non-residential and multi-family residential buildings shall include an area for parking
bicycles. Bicycle parking standards are based on the number of users for each building
type and the expected time needed to park the bike. All bicycle parking requirements
(short and long-term) should be demonstrated on site plans or final plats for the
development.
The minimum number of bicycle parking spaces per any multi-family or non-residential
use, when required is two or one rack. A single inverted U bicycle parking rack will
count as two bicycle parking spaces. The maximum required short-term bicycle spaces
shall be 20, or 10 racks for any single development. See Section 8.3 for numbers of
spaces per type of use.
8.6.2 SHORT TERM BICYCLE PARKING
A short term bicycle parking space is defined as a rack to which the frame and at least
one wheel can be secured using varying types of bike locks (U-lock, wire cable, etc.). This
type of parking is appropriate for short-term parking such as shopping areas, libraries,
other places where the typical parking duration is less than two hours.
8.6.3 LONG TERM BICYCLE PARKING
A long term bicycle parking space is defined as protecting the entire bicycle and its
components from inclement weather. It is to be located where it will service the needs of
cyclists who need to leave their bicycles unattended for extended periods of time, such
as employees, tenants or residents. Examples of long term parking may include indoor
parking, racks in covered loading dock areas, racks in garage structures, bicycle lockers or
other means which provide coverage to bicycles. Such parking may be restricted to use
only by employees, tenants, residents or others at the discretion of the property owner
or management.
Examples of long term bicycle parking include bike lockers, covered and fenced
bicycle racks, or interior rooms with secure access where bicycles may be stored. It is
recommended that buildings designed for 50 or more employees build a shower/locker
room for those employees who may commute from long distances. See http:www.
bikeparking.com for examples of secure bike lockers and other long-term bicycle storage
devices.

8.6.4 COVERED SPACES
A. If 10 or more bicycle spaces are required, at
least 50 percent of the bicycle spaces must be
covered by an awning or placement under an
arcade or other means. The cover for bicycle
parking shall be a minimum of seven feet
above finished grade. This protects bicycles
and provides shelter from inclement weather
for cyclists while securing the bicycle and
loading purchases.
B. When motor vehicle parking is provided in a
covered space (such as under a building or in
a parking deck), all short term bicycle parking
may be located in the structure or other areas
protected from the weather. If short term
bicycle parking is provided in a parking deck,
the bike racks must be located on ground level
at the nearest point to the building entrance.
C. Motorcycles, mopeds, and other one-person
occupancy motorized vehicles may park under
covered bicycle parking shelters. Motorized
vehicles shall not obstruct or limit access to
bicycle parking under covered shelters.
8.6.5 REQUIRED RACKS
When bicycle racks are used, they should
contain two (2) locking points between one
(1) feet and three (3) feet off the ground and
gap near the bottom for pedal clearance,
enabling one to lock a bicycle frame and
one of the wheels with a standard U-Lock.
Inverted-U, A-style, and Post and Loop racks
are recommended examples. Comb, toast,
school-yard, and other wheel bending racks
providing no support for the bicycle frame are
not recommended.
8.6.6 REQUIRED RACK SITING & DIMENSIONS OF BICYCLE
PARKING
A. Racks shall be secured to the ground on a
hard surface such as concrete, asphalt, or
unit pavers.
B. Each bicycle parking space shall provide six
feet by two feet (6x2) in area per bicycle.
Short Term Bicycle Parking: Racks which are not protected from inclement weather,
such as the example above, are considered short term bicycle parking spaces. All racks
(short and long term) are required to support the bicycle at two points on the frame.
The Inverted U rack shown above is a common type of bicycle rack that satisfies this
requirement.
Long Term Bicycle Parking: Long term bicycle parking spaces provide protection for the
entire bicycle from potential inclement weather. This may be accomplished through
a variety of techniques, including racks in parking structures (top), bicycle lockers
(bottom), interior bike parking rooms, etc. (See www.bikeparking.com for examples of
bicycle lockers and other long term storage devices.)

through payment-in-lieu so long as all applicable street tree and parking lot
planting requirements are met and the payment-in-lieu option is approved
by the Planning Director based on existing and proposed site features and
the provisions of this ordinance. For payment-in-lieu values, see the Town
of Davidson Fee Schedule. Note: In calculating the payment-in-lieu value a
1:1 credit per square foot shall be given for the following: Areas eradicated
of invasive species (as determined by the Arborist) and replanted; or areas
eradicated of invasive species and preserved for viewsheds as part of an
approved plan. The decision to award credit shall be made by the Planning
Director in consultation with the Arborist.
C. Credit Toward Coverage Requirement:
1. Preserved/Planted Species: All trees preserved or planted to satisfy the
requirements of this ordinance, as well as other tree plantings included as part
of an approved plan, may count toward the minimum project canopy coverage
requirements established above. This means that the requirements may be met
through the preservation of existing tree vegetation, new tree plantings, or a
combination of both; however, every reasonable effort shall be made to meet the
coverage requirement through the preservation of existing trees.
2. Viewshed Preservation: In calculating the canopy coverage requirement, areas
maintained or restored to preserve a publicly-accessible viewshed documented as
part of an approved plan may receive a 1:1 credit per square foot, not to exceed 10
percent of the total project area.
9.3.2 PRESERVATION OF EXISTING VEGETATION FOR CONDITIONAL PLANNING AREA, MASTER PLAN,

E. Construction Standards :
1. Access: Construction access to a site should occur where an existing or proposed
Tree Canopy Landscaping & Screening I 9.3 Tree Coverage & Preservation
9 - 8 DAV I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 11.01.19
entrance/exit is located. Except for driveway access points, sidewalks and curb and
gutter, land disturbance within a tree dripline is prohibited as outlined below.
2. Prohibited Activity:
 Trenching, placing backfill in the critical root zone (CRZ), driving or parking
equipment in the CRZ, and dumping of trash, oil, paint or other materials
detrimental to plant health in close proximity of the trees to be preserved is
prohibited.
 Construction traffic, storage of vehicles and materials, grading, and unapproved
site disturbance shall not take place within the CRZ of the existing trees.
The areas shall remain free of all building materials, stockpiled soil or other
construction debris.
3. Protection Requirements:
a. Location: Protective barricades shall be placed around all trees designated to
be saved prior to the start of development activities or grading. Such barricades
shall be erected at a radial recommended minimum distance of 1.5 feet for
every inch of trunk diameter at breast height (DBH) or the dripline, whichever
is greater and outside the CRZ as approved by the Arborist, unless the Arborist
approves a different distance based on the approved development plan or
site circumstances. For example, a 12-inch diameter tree trunk at breast height
should have a minimal radial protection zone of 18 feet. The circular diameter of
protection around the trunk would be 36 feet from the base of the tree. Prior to
approval of construction beginning, the Arborist must approve and inspect the
barricade designs and installation.
b. Materials: Protective barricades shall consist of 2 x 4 posts with 1 x 4 rails or
orange safety fence.
c. Duration: Protective barricades shall remain in place until development
activities are complete.
d. Grading Protocol: Where grading within a tree dripline cannot be avoided and
is approved by the Planning Director and/or Arborist, cut and fill shall be limited
to 1/4 to 1/3 of the area within the dripline. Tree roots must be pruned with
clean cuts at the edge of the disturbed area, and no fill shall be placed within
the dripline of a tree without venting to allow air and water to reach the roots.
In the case of an approved construction or grading permit within the CRZ, the
Arborist shall provide and ensure recommendations to protect the affected
trees are implemented.
F. Replacement of Preserved or Planted Trees: The proper care and protection of trees
throughout and beyond the development process is critical. Penalties for violations
range from $50.00 to $ 1,000.00 or more per tree or $ 5.00 to $10.00 per square foot
disturbed and, depending on the penalty, may be enforced on landowners as well as
parties executing work. For information on replacement plantings and civil penalties,
see Section 15.3 Landscaping Violations.

9 - 1 0 DAV I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 11.01.19
Director, in consultation with the Arborist, shall determine whether a civil penalty is
assessed in those situations.
Factors that may be considered in the Arborists findings include but are not limited
to whether the tree(s):
a. Health/Endangerment:
- Is dead, diseased, irreparably damaged, or the tree imminently endangers
the health or safety of the general public or structures on the property or
adjacent properties;
- Has not been appropriately maintained such that its current condition is
compromised and cannot be corrected through reasonable care practices;
b. Characteristics:
- Is not a specimen tree, as defined by this ordinance;
- Has officially-documented historic or cultural value and requires approval
by the Historic Preservation Commission.
c. Location:
- Is within a designated conservation area, such as common open space or
property protected by conservation easement;
- Is located within the permitted building envelope;
- If removed will negate the lots ability to meet the minimum tree canopy
coverage listed in Table 9-1;
- Is part of a greater development plan for which an approved landscape
plan has been issued pursuant to this section; an approved development
plan for which an approved grading and landscape plan has been issued
shall serve as the tree removal permit.
6. Permit Issued: The permit shall be issued when the Planning Director, in
consultation with the Arborist, has determined that the process requirements set
forth in Section 9.3.3.B have been satisfied.
7. Prohibitions:
a. Tree-Topping: The topping of trees and similar practices is strictly prohibited
in areas regulated by approved plans; outside of site areas approved for preapplication
clearing; in designated tree save or preservation areas or, within
the public right-of-way. Topping is the practice of reducing a trees size using
heading cuts that shorten limbs or branches back to a predetermined crown
limit (ANSI A300 Part 1 Pruning, Tree Care Industry Association).
b. Root Zone Disturbance: No activity affecting the critical root zone of a tree(s)
in a conservation easement or dedicated open space areas may proceed
without a tree permit.

vested rights for a period greater than two years, provided the total period does not exceed
five years from the date of plan approval of the site.
The vesting of any plan beyond a two year period shall only be authorized by the Board of
Commissioners where it is found that due to (i) the sizing and phasing of the development;

consistent with the original approval.

sent by first class mail by the Planning Director to the applicant within five working days
Watershed Protection Overlay District I 17.7 Watershed Areas EstablishED
Town of Davidson, NC D A V I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 1 7 - 1 1
of the disapproval. The applicant may make revisions or changes and submit a revised
plan. The application fee may be waived if the Planning Director determines the changes
are not substantial.
17.7.4 BUFFER AREAS REQUIRED
A. Vegetative Buffers
Developments must place or maintain undisturbed vegetative buffers, except as specifically
provided in this section, along the shoreline of Lake Norman measured horizontally by a
licensed land surveyor from the full pond elevation (760 contour) and along each side of
all perennial streams (as indicated on the most up-to-date version of a U.S.G.S. 1:24,000-7.5
minute map or as otherwise determined by local government studies) measured from the
top of the bank on each side on the stream. Minimum buffer widths are 40 feet if the low
density option is used or 100 feet if the high density option is used.
The following actions may not be undertaken without Planning Director approval:
 Restoration: Desirable artificial stream bank or shoreline stabilization.
 Removal: The removal of dead or diseased trees. Removal of underbrush is not
permitted in the buffer except at approved pathways and locations.
 Tree Limbing: At approved locations, trees may be limbed up to half the distance of
their height, not to exceed 15 feet above grade.
B. Development in Buffer
No new development is allowed in the vegetative buffer area except for water-borne
structures (e.g. piers, docks, etc.) and public projects such as road crossings and greenways,
where no practical alternative exists. These activities should minimize built-upon surface
area, direct runoff away from the surface waters and maximize the utilization of stormwater
Best Management Practices.
17.7.7 PUBLIC HEALTH REGULATIONS
No activity, situation, structure or land use shall be allowed within a WS district which poses
a threat to water quality and the public health, safety, and welfare. Such conditions may
arise from inadequate on-site sewage systems which utilize ground absorption; inadequate
sedimentation and erosion control measures; the improper storage or disposal of junk,
trash, or other refuse within a buffer area; the absence or improper implementation of a spill
containment plan for toxic and hazardous materials; the improper management of stormwater
runoff; or any other situation found to pose a threat to water quality.
The Planning Director shall monitor land use activities within all WS districts to identify
situations that may pose a threat to water quality. The Planning Director shall report all findings
to the proper agency to handle the threat and/or the Board of Commissioners. The Planning
Director may consult with any public agency or official and request recommendations. The
Planning Director may consult with any public agency or official and request recommendations.
Where the Planning Director finds a threat to water quality and the public health, safety, and
welfare, the Planning Director shall institute any appropriate action or proceeding to restrain,
correct or abate the condition and/or violation as herein authorized.

Watershed Protection Overlay District I 17.8 BUILT-UPON AREA Averaging (DENSITY AVERAGING)
Town of Davidson, NC D A V I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 1 7 - 1 7
17.8 BUILT-UPON AREA AVERAGING (DENSITY AVERAGING)
Built-Upon Area (BUA) Averaging allows parcels located within the Lake Norman Critical
Watershed to obtain additional development rights through an increase in a sites builtupon-
area (BUA) by averaging the total BUA of the developing lot (i.e. receiving lot) with the
total BUA of an undeveloped/less developed lot within the same watershed and jurisdiction
(donating lot). This is accomplished by transferring undeveloped area on a donating lot to a
receiving lot via a BUA Averaging Certificate, which includes a non-revocable easement, metes
and bounds description, and recorded plat of the area(s) to remain undisturbed. The BUA
Averaging Certificate requires approval by the Watershed Review Board, a sub-set of the Board
of Adjustment; for the purposes of this ordinance, the Board of Adjustment may act as the
Watershed Review Board.
17.8.1 PURPOSE & ELIGIBILITY, PROCESS, DOCUMENTATION
A. Purpose: The purpose of this provision is to preserve open space in the more sensitive
areas of the watershed, and to ensure orderly and planned development throughout the
watershed.
B. Uses: The participating parcels may include or be developed for residential or nonresidential
purposes under the Individual Building and Master Plan processes. To be eligible
to pursue the averaging process, the parent parcel must first have received approval through
the required development approval process.
Eligible uses permitted to utilize this program include but are not limited to: Residential
uses intended to meet an identified housing need (i.e. less than 120 percent of AMI), or Civic/
Educational/Institutional uses as defined by the Davidson Planning Ordinance. Additional
uses will be considered by the Board of Adjustment on a case by case basis.
Note: Individual parcels whose principal use is or will be single-family residential are not
eligible to be considered as receiving parcels if the total built-upon area (BUA) would exceed
24 percent; this includes uses within the Single-Family Detached House building type. This
does not apply to parcels owned and managed by non-profit entities whose mission is to
provide affordable housing.
C. Requirements: The following requirements must be met by all parcels:
1. Ownership: Only the owner(s) of the participating parcels may submit a Density
Averaging Certificate application. Areas subject to easements, covenants, and/or
development restrictions not legally controlled by the owner may not be included as
donated parcel area; this includes right-of-way area.
2. Pre-Existing Variance: No parcel for which a watershed variance has been granted, or
would be required, may be included as a donating or receiving parcel.
3. Location: Participating parcels shall be located in the same water supply watershed and
preferably in the same drainage area of the watershed. All parcels must be located within
the Town of Davidsons planning jurisdiction.
4. Transferability: A property in a more restricted watershed area shall not acquire BUA from
a property in a less restricted watershed area.

1 7 - 1 8 DAV I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 08.22.18
5. Overall Area: The cumulative BUA of all participating parcels shall not exceed the BUA
that would be allowed if the parcels were developed separately.
6. Buffers: On all participating parcels buffers shall at least meet the applicable, minimum
ordinance requirements for parcels located in water supply watersheds.
7. Preservation: The donated area shall remain in an undisturbed vegetated or natural
state. Previously developed or graded lots may be used as donating parcels so
long as the donated area of the lot is revegetated according to Davidson Planning
Ordinance requirements. The donated area shall be irrevocable unless amended per the
requirements of this ordinance prior to the undertaking of any development activity on
the participating parcels.
8. Required Features: When the donated area of a parcel abuts street frontage or right-ofway,
the preserved area shall feature park or public space amenities as determined by the
Planning Director.
9. Stormwater Design: All participating parcels must meet the applicable buffer and
engineered stormwater controls as outlined in the ordinance. Parcels shall be controlled
by on-site facilities in accordance with the criteria specified in the Davidson Water Quality
Design Manual and the Davidson Planning Ordinance for high-density development.
Development permitted under BUA averaging and meeting applicable low density
requirements shall transport stormwater runoff by vegetated conveyances to the
maximum extent practicable.
10. Design: Built-upon areas shall be designed and located to minimize stormwater runoff
impact to the receiving waters, minimize concentrated stormwater flow, maximize the use
of sheet flow through vegetated areas, and maximize the flow length through vegetated
areas.
17.8.2 PROCESS
A Built-Upon Area (BUA) Averaging Certificate shall be obtained from the Watershed Review
Board (Board of Adjustment) to ensure that all participating parcels considered together meet

18.1 GENERAL
18.1.1 SHORT TITLE
The regulations set out in this ordinance (sometimes herein
referred to as this regulation or this ordinance) shall be
known and may be cited as the Floodplain Regulations of
Davidson, North Carolina.
18.1.2 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part
6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3, 5, and 8 of Article 19 of
Chapter 160A; and Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the North
Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental
units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
18.1.3 FINDINGS OF FACT
The flood hazard areas of Davidson and Davidsons Land Use
jurisdiction are subject to periodic inundation which results
in loss of life, increased health and safety hazards, destruction
of property, and disruption of commerce and governmental
services. Inundation from flood waters results in public
expenditures for flood protection, flood disaster relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect
of obstructions in Floodplains, causing increases in flood
heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard
areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.

18.1.4 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and
to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
A. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water
or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or
velocities;
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
C. Control the alteration of natural Floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers
which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
D. Control filling, grading, dredging and other Development which may increase erosion or
flood damage; and
E. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood
waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
18.1.5 OBJECTIVES
The regulations of the Special Flood Hazard Areas herein set forth are intended to protect areas
of designated Floodplains subject to and necessary for regulating flood waters and to permit
and encourage the retention of open-land uses which will be so located and designed as to
constitute a harmonious and appropriate part of the physical development of the Town as
provided in the comprehensive plans as such are adopted and amended from time to time.
The specific intent in establishing Special Flood Hazard Areas composed of floodways and
flood fringe areas includes the following:
A. To control uses such as fill dumping, storage of materials, structures, buildings and any
other works which, acting alone or in combination with other existing or future uses,
would cause damaging flood heights and velocities by obstructing flows and reducing
floodplain storage;
B. To protect human life and health;
C. To minimize the expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects;
D. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
E. To permit certain uses which can be appropriately located in flood hazard areas and to
assure such permitted uses will not impede the flow of flood waters or otherwise cause
danger to life and property at or above or below their locations along the floodways;
F. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
G. To protect existing drainage courses that carry abnormal flows of stormwater in
periods of heavy precipitations;
H. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in Floodplains;
Floodplain Overlay District I 18.2 Definitions
Town of Davidson, NC D A V I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 1 8 - 3
I. To meet the needs of the streams to carry flood waters and protect the creek channels
and Floodplains from Encroachment so that flood heights and flood damage will not be
increased;
J. To inform existing and potential property owners that property is in a Special Flood
Hazard Area as well as the associated flood risks and development restrictions;
K. To minimize future flood losses by depicting Community Flood Fringe Areas on the
Flood Insurance Rate Maps and;
L. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development
of flood prone areas.
This ordinance is intended to permit only that Development within the Floodplain which
is appropriate in light of the probability of flood damage and presents a reasonable social
and economic use of land in relation to the hazards involved. The regulations hereinafter
set forth shall apply to all property located within the Special Flood Hazard Area as
shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) including FEMA and/or locally approved
revisions to data shown on the FIRMs. It is the intent that these regulations combine with
and coordinate with the planning ordinance regulations for the planning area in which
such property is located. Any use not permitted by the planning ordinance shall not be
permitted in the Special Flood Hazard Area, and any use permitted by the ordinance
regulations shall be permitted in these districts only upon meeting conditions and
requirements as prescribed in this ordinance.

A. A Floodplain Development Permit is required for any Development within the
Community Special Flood Hazard Area (CSFHA) and is subject to the conditions below.
The Floodplain Administrator is authorized to create, and amend from time to time
as necessary, a Technical Guidance Document to help explain the application of the
provisions of this ordinance, specifically the Floodplain Development Permit provisions,
through the use of charts and related written materials. The Technical Guidance
Document shall not be a part of this ordinance, and shall be solely for illustrative and
educational purposes. If there is any discrepancy between the Technical Guidance
Document and this ordinance, the provisions of this ordinance shall control.
B. Floodplain Development Permits fall into one of two types: General Floodplain

The intent of the General Floodplain Development Permit (GFDP) is to allow uses or activities
in the Community Special Flood Hazard Area (including the FEMA Floodway and Community
Encroachment Area) which inherently will not increase FEMA and/or Community Base
Flood Elevations. The following uses and activities are permitted under a GFDP, without
the need for an Individual Floodplain Development Permit, Floodway Engineering Analysis
or variance, as long as they result in no Technically Measurable increases in FEMA and/or
Community Base Flood Elevations. A No-Rise Certification may be required by the Floodplain
Administrator to demonstrate no technically-measurable increases.
A. General farming, pasture, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuaries, gardens, lawns,
landscaping and other similar activities;
B. Utility infrastructure (poles, sewer manholes, vent pipes, underground utilities, etc.),
sign poles, non-solid fences, and other similar activities.
C. On-grade driveways, trails, sidewalks, boardwalks, roads and road maintenance; storm
drainage system construction, repairs and maintenance (Major & Minor system), and
other similar activities. The Floodplain Administrator must be notified in writing,
including a project description and sketch plan, prior to commencement of these
activities.

prescribed above, the Floodplain Administrator shall find that the building or
Development is in violation of the Floodplain Regulations, he shall issue an order in
writing to the owner or occupant, requiring the owner or occupant to remedy the
violation within such period, not less than sixty (60) calendar days, as the Floodplain
Administrator may prescribe; provided that, where the Floodplain Administrator
finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he may order that
corrective action be taken in such lesser period as may be feasible.

19.1. TITLE
This Ordinance may be cited as the Town of Davidson Soil
Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance.
19.2. PREAMBLE
The Sedimentation of streams, lakes, wetlands and other
waters of this State constitute a major pollution problem.
Sedimentation occurs from the Erosion or depositing of soil
and other materials into the waters. Control of Erosion and
Sedimentation is deemed vital to the public interest and
necessary to public health and welfare, and expenditures
of funds for Erosion and Sedimentation control programs
shall be deemed for public purpose. It is the purpose of
this Ordinance to provide for creation, administration,
and enforcement of the program through procedures
and for the adoption of mandatory standards that will
permit development of this Town to continue with the
least detrimental effects from pollution by Sedimentation.
In recognition of desirability of early coordination of
Sedimentation control planning, it is the intention of the
Town Board that pre-construction conferences be held
among the affected parties.

20.1 OVERVIEW
20.1.1 TITLE
This ordinance shall be officially known as the Post-
Construction Storm Water Ordinance. It is referred to herein
as this ordinance.
20.1.2 AUTHORITY
The Town of Davidson is authorized to adopt this ordinance
pursuant to North Carolina law, including but not limited
to Article 14, Section 5 of the Constitution of North
Carolina; North Carolina General Statutes 143-214.7 and
rules promulgated by the Environmental Management
Commission thereunder; Session Law 2004-163; Chapter
160A, §§ 174, 185.
20.1.3 FINDINGS
It is hereby determined that:
Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic
response of local watersheds and increase storm water
runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream
channel erosion, non-point source pollution, and sediment
transport and deposition, as well as reduce groundwater
recharge;
These changes in storm water runoff contribute to increased
quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations in
hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as
well as to the natural environment; and

These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned
controls to manage storm water runoff from development sites.
Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (Clean Water Act) and federal
Phase II Storm Water Rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the North Carolina
Environmental Management Commission promulgated in response to federal Phase II
requirements, compel certain urbanized areas, including the Town of Davidson, to adopt the
minimum storm water controls such as those included in this ordinance.
Therefore, the Town of Davidson establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations
to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of storm water runoff
and discharge.
20.1.4 PURPOSE
(A) General
The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health,
safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements
and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-construction storm
water runoff and non-point source pollution associated with new development and
redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of constructionrelated
and post-construction storm water runoff will minimize damage to public and
private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, and general
welfare, and protect water and aquatic resources.
(B) Specific
This ordinance seeks to meet its general purpose through the following specific
objectives and means:
(1) Establishing decision-making processes for development that protect the integrity
of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources;
(2) Minimizing changes to the pre-development hydrologic response for new
development and redevelopment in their post-construction state in accordance
with the requirements of this ordinance for the applicable design storm in order to
reduce flooding, streambank erosion, and non-point and point source pollution, as
well as to maintain the integrity of stream channels, aquatic habitats and healthy
stream temperatures;
(3) Establishing minimum post-construction storm water management standards and
design criteria for the regulation and control of storm water runoff quantity and
quality;
(4) Establishing design and review criteria for the construction, function, and use of
structural storm water control facilities that may be used to meet the minimum postconstruction
storm water management standards;
(5) Establishing criteria for the use of better management and site design practices,
such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas;
Post Construction Storm water ordinance I 20.1 Overview
Town of Davidson, NC D A V I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 2 0 - 3
(6) Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of
structural and nonstructural storm water best management practices (BMPs) to
ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately,
and pose minimum risk to public safety; and
(7) Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and
disapproval of storm water management plans, for the inspection of approved
projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance.
20.1.5 APPLICABILITY AND JURISDICTION
(A) General
The requirements of this article shall apply to all developments and redevelopments
within the corporate limits or in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Town of Davidson,
unless one of the following exceptions applies to the development or redevelopment as
of July 1, 2007:
(1) Master Plan approved;
(2) Zoning use application submitted and accepted for review for uses that do not
require a building permit;
(3) Certificate of Building Code Compliance issued by the proper governmental
authority;
(4) Valid building permit issued pursuant to G.S. § 153A-344 or G.S. § 160A-385(b)(i), so
long as the permit remains valid, unexpired, and unrevoked;
(5) Common law vested right established (e.g., the substantial expenditure of resources
(time, labor, money) based on a good faith reliance upon having received a valid
governmental approval to proceed with a project); and/or
(6) A conditional zoning district (including those districts which previously were
described variously as conditional district, conditional use district, parallel
conditional district and parallel conditional use district) approved prior to the
effective date of this article/ordinance, provided formal plan submission has been
made and accepted for review either prior to five years from the effective date of
this ordinance in the case of conditional zoning districts approved on or after June
11, 2001, or prior to two years from the effective date of this ordinance in the case
of conditional zoning districts approved prior to June 11, 2001, and provided such
plans encompass either a minimum of 25 percent of the area of the project, or any
phase of a project so long as such phase is part of a project that includes projectwide
water quality requirements to achieve 85 percent TSS removal from developed
areas. If no such formal plan submission occurs within the above-described five-year
or two-year time frames, the requirements of this ordinance shall be applied to the
project, except for total phosphorus removal, undisturbed open space and buffer
requirements not in effect at the time of the approval of the conditional zoning
district, all of which do not apply. Any changes to a conditional zoning district
necessary to comply with the requirements of this ordinance shall be made through
administrative amendment and not through a rezoning.

20.3.6 TOTAL PHOSPHORUS MITIGATION
(A) Purpose
The purpose of this mitigation is to reduce the cost of complying with the 70 percent
total phosphorus removal criteria for developments exceeding 50 percent built-upon
area while ensuring the reduction of pollution loads and achievement of the ordinance
objectives.
(B) General Description
There are two (2) total phosphorus mitigation options available to developments
greater than or equal to 60 percent built-upon area, including off-site mitigation and a
buy-down option as described in this Section. For developments with greater than or
equal to 50 percent and less than 60 percent built-upon area, off-site mitigation only
is allowed provided it occurs in the same named creek system. Both off-site and buydown
mitigation will result in the construction of retrofit BMPs in the same river basin
(Catawba or Yadkin) as the mitigated site. In addition, the buy-down option is available
provided the Town of Davidson has projects and/or property available for mitigation.
(C) Criteria for Off-Site Mitigation
(1) The owner or designee of a proposed construction site that will include greater than
or equal to 50 percent built upon area shall construct a BMP retrofit project designed
to achieve an equivalent or greater net mass removal of total phosphorus as would
be achieved by removing 70 percent of the total phosphorus from the proposed
site. Off-site mitigation is allowed only for total phosphorus removal above 50
percent. On-site BMPs shall be constructed to achieve 50 percent removal of total
phosphorus.
(2) The Storm Water Administrator shall receive, review, approve, disapprove or approve
with conditions an Application for Off-Site Total Phosphorus Mitigation. The
Storm Water Administrator shall design this application to include all pertinent
information. This application shall be submitted with the storm water management
permit application and shall at a minimum contain a description of the BMP(s)
to be constructed, including their type and size as well as the pollutant removal
efficiencies to be achieved. The location of the site where the BMP(s) are to be
constructed shall be described, including the size of the drainage area to be treated
and percentage and type of existing built upon area. The application must also
include the pounds of total phosphorus being mitigated for and the pounds of total
phosphorus reduced with the retrofit BMP(s). A legally valid instrument shall be
submitted with the application to demonstrate that the applicant has land rights to
perform the BMP retrofit on the property.

(3) The criteria for approval of off-site total phosphorus mitigation by the Storm Water
Administrator are as follows:
(a) BMP(s) must be constructed in accordance with 15A NCAC 2H .1008(c), as
explained in the Design Manual.
(b) BMP(s) must be sized for the corresponding watershed area according to the
Design Manual.
(c) BMP(s) must be inspected by the Storm Water Administrator and found to be
in compliance with all approved plans and specifications prior to the release of
occupancy permits for the mitigated site.
(d) Following approval from the Storm Water Administrator, BMP(s) may be installed
and credits obtained for pounds of total phosphorus removed that can be applied
to future projects. These credits can be accumulated or banked for a period of
time as specified by the Storm Water Administrator in the Administrative Manual.
(e) All off-site mitigation BMPs shall be subject to the maintenance requirements as
well as installation and maintenance performance securities specified in Section
20.6 of this ordinance.
(D) Criteria for Total Phosphorus Buy-Down Option
(1) The owner or designee of a proposed construction site that will include greater than
or equal to 60 percent built upon area may buy-down the 70 percent phosphorus
removal requirement to no less than 50percent. On-site BMPs must be installed to
remove the remaining total phosphorus load. The money shall be used by the Town
of Davidson to purchase undisturbed open space, make infrastructure repairs and/or
construct BMP retrofit projects designed to achieve an equivalent or greater net mass
removal of total phosphorus as would be achieved by removing 70 percent of the total
phosphorus from the proposed site.
(2) The Storm Water Administrator shall receive, review, approve, disapprove or approve
with conditions an Application for Total Phosphorus Buy-Down. The Storm Water
Administrator shall design this application to include all pertinent information. This
application shall be submitted with the storm water management permit application
and shall at a minimum contain calculations showing the total load buy-down and all
cost calculations as described in the Administrative Manual.
(3) The criteria for the buy-down option are as follows:
(a) The buy-down option shall not be approved by the Storm Water Administrator
unless projects and/or properties are available for mitigation, including BMP
construction, BMP maintenance, BMP rehabilitation and stream restoration.
(b) There is no time constraint for the Town of Davidson to spend mitigation money;
however, the Town of Davidson shall strive to spend buy-down monies in a timely
and efficient manner such that a net improvement in water quality results.
(c) All BMPs constructed by the Town of Davidson as part of this mitigation option
shall be maintained by the Town of Davidson into perpetuity.
(4) The criteria for calculating the buy-down cost shall be provided in the Design Manual.

20.3.7 DEED RECORDATION AND INDICATIONS ON PLAT
The approval of the storm water management permit shall require an enforceable
restriction on property usage that runs with the land, such as plat, recorded deed
restrictions or protective covenants, to ensure that future development and
redevelopment maintains the site consistent with the approved project plans. The location
of all designated Undisturbed Open Space for a site shall be recorded at the Register of
Deeds Office as Undisturbed Open Space. Streams and buffer boundaries including the
delineation of each buffer zone must be specified on all surveys and record plats. The
applicable operations and maintenance agreement pertaining to every structural BMP
shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with the Mecklenburg County
Register of Deeds Office upon final plat approval. If no subdivision plat is recorded for
the site, then the operations and maintenance agreement shall be recorded with the
Mecklenburg County Register of Deeds Office so as to appear in the chain of title of all
subsequent purchasers under generally accepted searching principles. A copy of the
recorded maintenance agreement shall be provided to the Storm Water Administrator
within fourteen (14) days following receipt of the recorded document. A maintenance
easement shall be recorded for every structural BMP to allow sufficient access for adequate
maintenance. The specific recordation and deed restriction requirements as well as notes
to be displayed on final plats and deeds shall be contained in the Administrative Manual.

20.5 UNDISTURBED OPEN SPACE
20.5.1 PURPOSE
Undisturbed Open Space provides for a reduction in the negative impacts from storm
water runoff through non-structural means. The combination of the structural BMPs
described in Section 3 with the non-structural Undisturbed Open Space provisions
described in this Section allow the objectives of this ordinance to be fulfilled.
20.5.2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Undisturbed Open Space is required for all development unless mitigated. The
percentage of Undisturbed Open Space required depends on a projects built-upon area
as described below. Undisturbed Open Space requirements can be met in stream or
lake buffers, designated common areas or on individual lots for residential development
(e.g., backyards, borders, etc.). Undisturbed Open Space can not be designated within
rights of way, utility easements, etc. where re-disturbance could occur. Grass fields can
also be used to meet Undisturbed Open Space requirements; however, the fields must
be replanted in accordance with the tree planting provisions described in Section 505
(C) below. Undisturbed Open Space is preferred where it will provide maximum water
quality benefit (i.e. around gullies and existing drainage areas, adjacent to streams and
wetlands, around structural BMPs, etc.).
20.5.3 UNDISTURBED OPEN SPACE CRITERIA
Undisturbed Open Space requirements apply to projects as described below.
(A) Less Than 24% Built-Upon Area
A project with less than 24% built-upon area shall include as Undisturbed Open
Space within the boundaries of the project a minimum of 25% of the project area.
(B) Greater Than or Equal to 24% and Less Than 50% Built-Upon Area
A project with greater than or equal to 24% and less than 50% built-upon area shall
include as Undisturbed Open Space within the boundaries of the project a minimum
of 17.5% of the project area.
(C) Greater Than or Equal to 50% Built-Upon Area
A project with greater than or equal to 50% built-upon area shall include as
Undisturbed Open Space within the boundaries of the project a minimum of 10% of
the project area.
20.5.4 UNDISTURBED OPEN SPACE DESIGNATION
The Undisturbed Open Space location shall be recorded at the Register of Deeds Office
as Undisturbed Open Space and future disturbance is prohibited except for greenway
trails with unlimited public access, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utility lines and channel
work/maintenance activities by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services. Other
utility work may be allowed in the Undisturbed Open Space area provided it will not
result in loss of Undisturbed Open Space as approved by the Town of Davidson.

(2) Off-Site Mitigation
On a case by case basis and at the sole discretion of the Storm Water Administrator,
the Town of Davidson may allow Undisturbed Open Space disturbance and offsite
mitigation through the acceptance for ownership or conservation easement
properties for the protection of Undisturbed Open Space, provided the result will
be an increased protection of water quality over what would be attained through
preservation of Undisturbed Open Space or on site mitigation (see Administrative
Manual). This off-site mitigation shall be located in the same river basin (Catawba or
Yadkin) as the mitigated site.
(3) Payment-In-Lieu of Undisturbed Open Space Dedication
Payment-in-lieu of Undisturbed Open Space dedication is only allowed for industrial
and commercial developments and multi-family projects that are in excess of 50% built
upon area. Payment-in-lieu shall only be allowed to the extent an approved disturbance
cannot be offset by on-site mitigation as determined by the Storm Water Administrator.
The following criteria shall be fulfilled for the payment-in-lieu option:
(a) A fee shall be paid to the Town of Davidson where the property is located or its
designee based on the following formula: 1.25 x (appraised value of subject
property including intended use without improvements). The appraised value of
the subject property shall be determined by a licensed, independent real estate
appraiser retained by the developer or owner. The Town of Davidson may accept
the appraised value or at its discretion obtain its own appraisal. In the event the
parties cannot agree on the appraised value, the two appraised values shall be
averaged together to determine the final appraised value to be used in the formula
above.
(b) Payment shall be accepted by the Town of Davidson or its designee prior to land
disturbing activities.
(c) The Town of Davidson shall use the payment-in-lieu to purchase Undisturbed Open
Space in the same river basin (Catawba or Yadkin) as the property to be disturbed.
As an option, the Town of Davidson may elect to use up to 50 percent of the fee
to purchase and plant trees within the Town. In addition, the fee may be used
to repair infrastructure in the Town, including road repairs when water quality is
impacted. The payment-in-lieu is to be spent within a maximum of five (5) years of
the end of the calendar year from the receipt of the payment.
(D) Approval Criteria for Undisturbed Open Space Mitigation

responsible person/entity. The notification shall indicate the nature of the violation,
contain the address or other description of the site upon which the violation occurred
or is occurring, order the necessary action to abate the violation, and give a deadline
for correcting the violation. The notice shall, if required, specify a date by which the
responsible person/entity must comply with this ordinance, and advise that the
responsible person/entity is subject to remedies and/or penalties or that failure to
correct the violation within the time specified will subject the responsible person/
entity to remedies and/or penalties as described in Section 703 of this ordinance. In
determining the measures required and the time for achieving compliance, the Storm
Water Administrator shall take into consideration the technology and quantity of
work required, and shall set reasonable and attainable time limits. The Storm Water
Administrator may deliver the notice of violation and correction order personally by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by any means authorized for the
service of documents by Rule 4 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.
If a violation is not corrected within a reasonable period of time, as provided in the

Section 703, Remedies and Penalties, to correct and abate the violation and to ensure
compliance with this ordinance.
(C) Extension of Time
A responsible person/entity who receives a notice of violation and correction order, or
the owner of the land on which the violation occurs, may submit to the Storm Water
Administrator a written request for an extension of time for correction of the violation.
On determining that the request includes enough information to show that the violation
cannot be corrected within the specified time limit for reasons beyond the control of
the responsible person/entity requesting the extension, the Storm Water Administrator
may extend the time limit as is reasonably necessary to allow timely correction of the
violation, up to, but not exceeding 60 days. The Storm Water Administrator may grant
30-day extensions in addition to the foregoing extension if the violation cannot be
corrected within the permitted time due to circumstances beyond the control of the
responsible person/entity violating this ordinance. The Storm Water Administrator may

the filing of reports under oath as part of an investigation.
(F) Enforcement After Time to Correct
After the time has expired to correct a violation, including any extension(s) if authorized
by the Storm Water Administrator, the Storm Water Administrator shall determine if the
violation is corrected. If the violation is not corrected, the Storm Water Administrator
may act to impose one or more of the remedies and penalties authorized by Section 703.
(G) Emergency Enforcement
If delay in correcting a violation would seriously threaten the effective enforcement of
this ordinance or pose an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, then
the Storm Water Administrator may order the immediate cessation of a violation. Any
Person so ordered shall cease any violation immediately. The Storm Water Administrator
may seek immediate enforcement, without prior written notice, through any remedy or
penalty specified in Section 703.

shall notify the violator of the amount of the penalty and the reason for assessing
the penalty. This notice of assessment of civil penalty shall be served by any means
authorized under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4 and shall direct the violator to either pay the
assessment or file an appeal within 30 days of receipt of the notice as specified in

within 30 Days after it is due, or does not request a hearing as provided in Section
703(C), the Storm Water Administrator shall request the initiation of a civil action
to recover the amount of the assessment. The civil action shall be brought in
Mecklenburg County Superior Court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction.
A civil action must be filed within three (3) years of the date the assessment was due.
An assessment that is appealed is due at the conclusion of the administrative and
judicial review of the assessment.

version and in an appropriate software file.
On each side of the stream, a stream buffer shall begin at the edge of the stream channel
and extend perpendicular to the stream a distance equal to the lesser of 100 feet or to a
ridge line which changes the runoff flow to be away from the stream.
A stream buffer shall be divided into three stream buffer management zones, each
of which has different permitted land uses. Each zone shall be identified on any final
subdivision plat.
21.2.1 STREAMSIDE ZONE
The streamside zone is the 30 feet of stream buffer nearest the stream channel, measured
from the bank. If the stream buffer is at most 30 feet wide, then the entire stream buffer
falls within the streamside zone. With a few exceptions, land uses within the streamside
zone are limited to flood control and stream bank stabilization; otherwise, land
disturbances and vegetation clearing are prohibited. No buildings are permitted within
the streamside zone.
21.2.2 MANAGED USE ZONE
The managed use zone immediately follows the streamside zone to a maximum width
of 45 feet. If the stream buffer is greater than 30 feet but at most 75 feet wide, then the
stream buffer consists of the 30 feet of streamside zone followed by the residual as the
managed use zone. With a few exceptions, land uses with the managed use zone are
limited to storm water best management practices, passive recreation uses such as
greenway trails and bicycle paths and other land uses consistent with maintaining the
natural topography and vegetation. No building are permitted within the managed use
zone.
21.2.3 UPLAND ZONE
The upland zone immediately follows the managed use zone to a maximum width of
25 feet. If the stream buffer is greater than 75 feet but at most 100 feet wide, then the
stream buffer consists of 30 feet of streamside zone followed by 45 feet of managed use
zone followed by the residual as upland zone. With a few exceptions, land uses within the
upland zone are limited to storm water best management practices; passive recreation
uses such as greenway trails and bicycle paths, which may be built with impervious
materials; and other land uses consistent with maintaining the natural topography and
managing the natural vegetation, residential grass cover, or agricultural grasses. Only small
storage buildings (under 12 feet in every dimension) are permitted within the upland zone.

21.3 LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WITHIN THE STREAM BUFFER
MANAGEMENT ZONES
A. The following land uses are permitted within the stream buffers subject to the
requirement that the lands adjacent to these uses that are disturbed as a result of
these uses are stabilized and replanted with native vegetation:
1. Near perpendicular (75 degrees or greater) utility stream crossings approved by
the rest of this ordinance;
2. Parallel utility installation approved by the rest of this ordinance;
3. Near perpendicular (75 degrees or greater) stream crossings by streets or by
greenway trails, bicycle paths, sidewalks, and other pedestrian path approved by
the rest of this ordinance;
4. Near perpendicular (75 degrees or greater) crossings for farm animals with fencing
to minimize the animals impacts upon the stream buffers (do not require specific
plan approval);
5. Narrow footpaths constructed with minimal vegetation disturbance that permit
the landowner to walk to the stream (do not require specific plan approval);
6. Incidental drainage improvements or repairs for maintenance (do not require
specific plan approval);
7. Newly created ponds or lakes (do not require specific plan approval). New ponds
shall have the same buffers as the original creek, except that tree planting will not
be required. Buffer requirements will not apply to dams; and
8. Mitigation approved by a State or Federal agency acting under Sections 401 or 404
of the Clean Water Act.
B. Other land uses within the stream buffers may be approved as part of a development
plan subject to the requirement that the landowner demonstrate that the net result
of the land use and strategy to mitigate the impact of the land use provide at least the
same protection to the streams water quality and ecological integrity.
C. The continuation of existing agricultural uses.

22.7.2 REVIEW GUIDELINES
Prior to the designation of any historic landmark or district, the Commission shall prepare and
adopt guidelines not inconsistent with G.S. 160A-400.1  400.14 for constructing, altering,
restoring, rehabilitating, relocating, removing, or demolishing of property designated as historic,
which guidelines shall ensure, insofar as possible, that changes in designated landmarks or
properties located districts shall be in harmony with the reasons for designation.
22.7.3 CERTAIN CHANGES NOT PROHIBITED
Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent:
A. the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior feature of a historic landmark or property
located within a historic district, provided such maintenance or repair does not involve a
change in design, material, or appearance thereof;
B. the construction, alteration, relocation, or demolition of any such feature, building, or
structure when the Mecklenburg County Director of Code Enforcement certifies to the
Commission that such action is necessary to the public health or safety because of an unsafe
or dangerous condition;
C. a property owner from making of his property any use not otherwise prohibited by statute,
ordinance, or regulation; or
D. the maintenance of, or, in the event of an emergency, the immediate restoration of any
existing above ground utility structure without approval by the Commission.
22.7.4 DELAY OF DEMOLITION
A. Except as provided below, a Certificate authorizing the demolition of a designated historic
landmark or property located within a designated historic district may not be denied.
However, the Commission may delay the effective date of such a Certificate for a period
of up to 365 calendar days from the date of approval. The Commission may reduce the
period of delay where it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be deprived
permanently of all beneficial use of such property as a result of the delay. During the delay
period, the Commission shall negotiate with the property owner and with any other party in
an effort to find a means of preserving the property as provided in Section 22.3.4.
B. The Commission may deny an application for a Certificate authorizing the demolition or
destruction of any designated landmark, or of any property, building, site, object, area, or
structure located within a designated district, which the State Historic Preservation Office
has determined to be of Statewide Significance, as defined by the criteria of the National
Register of Historic Places, unless the Commission finds that the owner would suffer extreme
hardship or be deprived permanently of all beneficial use of the property as a result of the
denial.
C. In the event that the Commission has voted to recommend designation of a property as
a landmark, or of an area as a district, and such designation has not yet been made by the
Davidson Board of Commissioners, the demolition of any building, site, object, area, or
structure located on the property of the proposed landmark or within the proposed district
may be delayed by the Commission for a period of up to 180 calendar days or until the
Davidson Board of Commissioners takes final action on the proposed designation, whichever
occurs first. Should the Davidson Board of Commissioners approve the designation prior to
the expiration of the 180-day delay period, an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness
Historic Preservation Ordinance I 22.6 Historic Districts
Town of Davidson, NC D A V I D S O N P L A N N I N G O R D I N A N C E 2 2 - 1 1

shall be reduced by the number of days elapsed during the 180-day delay while designation
was pending.
22.7.5 DEMOLITION THROUGH NEGLECT
Failure of an owner to regularly, consistently, and fully maintain a designated landmark or any
property located within a designated district shall constitute demolition, through neglect,
without a valid Certificate of Appropriateness and a violation of this ordinance. The Commission
shall institute action, through the Davidson Code Enforcement official or the Mecklenburg
County Code Enforcement department, to prevent, restrain, correct, or otherwise abate such
demolition, provided such action includes appropriate safeguards to protect property owners
from undue economic hardship.
22.7.6 APPLICATIONS AND REQUIRED PROCEDURES
A. An application for a Certificate shall be obtained from Commission staff. Applications shall be

of facts to be entered into the minutes of its meetings. The minutes shall also contain a
summary of any citation to evidence, testimony, studies, or other authority upon which the
Commission based its decision.
G. The Commission shall have ninety (90) calendar days following submittal of a complete

extended by mutual agreement between the Commission and the applicant.
H. A Certificate shall be valid for 180 calendar days from date of issuance, or, in the case
of a Certificate for demolition, from the effective date. If the authorized work has not

L. In the case of any building, structure, site, area, or object designated as a historic landmark
or of any property located within a designated historic district being threatened with
demolition, as the result of willful neglect or otherwise, material alteration, rehabilitation, or
removal, except in compliance with this ordinance, the Commission, the Davidson Board of
Commissioners, or any other party aggrieved by such action may institute any appropriate
action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct, or otherwise abate such violation, or to
prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such property.
