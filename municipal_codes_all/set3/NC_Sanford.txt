PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Sanford, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1985 Code, as supplemented, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1985 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Susan Patterson, City Attorney, and other members of the staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

If any street under the provisions of such ordinances is to be widened, it need not be widened on both sides; and if it is to be widened on both sides, the distance to be widened on both sides need not be the same. Any ordinance introduced for the purpose of widening, extending, or opening any street under the provisions of this Charter, may not be adopted until the proposed ordinance is published in a newspaper having general circulation in the City and qualified to carry legal notices at least two times, on separate days, at least ten days before the passage of the ordinance, or, if there be not such newspaper, posted in three public places in the City. There shall be posted or published with the ordinance a notice stating when property owners may be heard by the City Council. A public hearing on the question of the adoption of such ordinance shall be held prior to the passage of the ordinance.

To that end, any person proposing to build upon such land or to make repairs or improvements to that part of any existing building situated thereon shall, in writing, notify the City Council of the nature and estimated cost of such building, repairs, or improvements. The City Council shall then determine whether it will take the necessary steps to acquire such property prior to the construction of such building or the making of such repairs or improvements and if it fails from 60 days from date of receipt of such notice to acquire, or to institute condemnation proceedings to acquire, such property, the owner or other person giving such notice may proceed to erect the building in accordance with the ordinances and regulation[s] of the City, or to make the repairs or improvements described in such notice. 
(Session Laws of 1967, chapter 650) 
Sec. 11.3. - Failure to give notice bars recovery for improvements. 
    If any person, firm, or corporation buildings [builds] upon any land included within proposed street lines, or repairs or otherwise improves that part of any existing building within the proposed street lines without giving the City an opportunity to acquire such land free from such improvements, as provided in the preceding Section, the City shall not be required to pay for the value of the building, repairs, or improvements in any proceedings subsequently brought to acquire such land for the purpose set out in the preceding Section. 
(Session Laws of 1967, chapter 650) 
Sec. 11.4. - Acquisition of land prior to improvement. 
    If upon receiving a notice in compliance with Section 11.2 the City Council determines to acquire such land immediately, it may acquire the same by grant, purchase, or condemnation. In no case shall an effort to purchase such land be necessary to the institution of condemnation proceedings. If the City Council determines to proceed by condemnation, the condemnation shall be as set forth in this Charter. 
(Session Laws of 1967, chapter 650) 
Sec. 11.5. - Cost of land acquired to be assessed as part of improvements.

(Session Laws of 1967, chapter 650) 
Sec. 11.6. - Exercise of condemnation power after failure of City to acquire following notice of improvement. 
    The failure of the City to acquire any land within 60 days after receiving notice that the same is to be built upon, or that a building thereon is to be repaired or otherwise improved, or its failure within such time to institute proceedings to condemn same, shall not limit the right of the City at any subsequent time to condemn the same; but in such case the owner shall be entitled to compensation as now provided by law for the building repairs, or improvements made after the giving of the required notice and the failure of the City to acquire such land free of such improvements.

    Sec. 2. That in order to equalize the assessments on real estate for the purposes described herein, the board of aldermen shall before the commencement of such street work or improvement, estimate the total cost of such improvement to be made in any district created or laid out for such purpose, and shall then prorate the cost thereof on the real estate abutting thereon in proportion to the frontage on the street, or portion of street so improved, and charge to and assess upon the real estate on each side of the street upon which work is to be done, its pro rata share of the entire cost of all such improvements made under the provisions of this act. 
    Sec. 3. That such assessments of estimated cost charged or assessed against abutting property, shall constitute a lien upon such abutting property from and after the date of the filing of a statement thereof by the street committee of the board of aldermen of said town in the office of the town clerk, payable and to be collected as hereinafter provided, and subject to such increase or reduction as may be necessary to make a just and equitable distribution of the actual cost of such improvement when ascertained as herein provided. 
    Sec. 4. That immediately upon the completion of the work in any district created, or section laid out, for street improvement by said board of aldermen, as herein provided, the town engineer, or other person or committee of the board of aldermen in charge of such work, shall make a report in writing to said board of aldermen showing the total actual cost of such improvement throughout the entire length of said district, or section, created or laid out, with the number and description of the lots abutting on said streets or portion thereof, so improved, together with the number of feet frontage of each of said lots and the owners thereof, and said board of aldermen shall ascertain, determine, and declare the actual cost of such improvements in such district or section, and in order to equalize the assessments on real estate for the purpose of paying therefor, shall take the total cost of such improvement throughout the entire district or section, and shall then pro rate the cost thereof and assess the same against the real estate abutting on the street therein, in proportion to the frontage on the street, or portion thereof, so improved, and charge to and assess against the real estate and each lot upon each side of the street upon which work is done, its pro rata share of the cost of such improvement: Provided, however, that the total cost of such street improvement in such district or section, as determined and declared by said board of aldermen, shall be final and conclusive, subject only to impeachment for fraud or collusion, with the right of appeal as herein provided.

In the event the owner or owners of any such lot or lots herein referred to, be an infant, idiot, lunatic, or incompetent, then his general guardian, if he has such, shall act for him; if he has none, it shall be the duty of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Lee County, North Carolina, to appoint a guardian ad litem to act for him.

In such cases of appeal from the board of aldermen, the ordinance laying out or creating the improvement district or section, the action of the board with reference to the special benefits, minutes of the proceedings of said board, the objections of the property owner with reference thereto, and all other documents with reference to the same, and material to the controversy, shall constitute the case on appeal, and be certified by the Town Clerk of Sanford to the Clerk of the Superior Court of Lee County, and docketed as other civil causes for trial, and shall be tried at the next ensuing term of said Court, with leave of either party to file such pleadings as he or it may be advised. If said issues or any of them, be found in favor of the Town of Sanford, to any amount, then judgment shall be rendered for and in favor of said Town for such amount, and the amount so found together with the costs of such appeal, to be assessed and taxed as costs in other civil actions, shall be and continue a lien against the property upon which the original assessment was placed, from the date of said original assessment, and shall be paid as herein provided, and by law provided, for the collection of judgments.

(6)  To contract with persons, firms, or corporations for terms not to exceed 20 years, for the operation of passenger and freight flights, scheduled or nonscheduled, and any other plane or flight activities not inconsistent with airport operations and to charge and collect reasonable fees, charges, and rents for the use of such property, and services rendered in the operation thereof. 
(7)  To operate, own, control, regulate, lease, or grant to others the license to operate amusements or concessions for a term not exceeding 20 years. 
(8)  To enter into contracts, and with the prior written approval of the County of Lee and the City of Sanford, to pledge as security the property of the airport authority; provided, however, that neither the airport authority nor the individual members thereof shall have any authority to pledge the credit of or contract for the County of Lee or the City of Sanford, or any combination thereof. With the prior written consent of the County of Lee and the City of Sanford, the airport authority shall be authorized to pledge any lease agreement to which it is a party as security for any loan. 
(9)  To adopt and use a seal. 
(10)  To contract with the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States of America or with the State of North Carolina or with any of the agencies or representatives of either of said governmental bodies relating to the grading, constructing, equipping, improving, maintaining, or operating of an airport or its facilities, or both. 
(b)  The Sanford-Lee County Regional Airport Authority shall enjoy governmental immunity, however, the authority may contract to insure itself and any of its officers, agents, or employees against liability for wrongful death or negligence or intentional damage to persons or property or against absolute liability for damage to persons or property caused by an act or omission of the authority or of any of its officers, agents, or employees when acting within the scope of their authority and the course of their employment. The members of the authority shall determine what liabilities and what officers, agents, and employees shall be covered by any insurance purchased pursuant to this provision. 
    Purchase of insurance pursuant to this provision waives the authority's governmental immunity to the extent of insurance coverage, for any act or omission occurring in the exercise of a governmental function. By entering into an insurance contract with the authority, an insurer waives any defense based upon the governmental immunity of the authority. 
    If the authority has waived its governmental immunity pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section, any person, or if he dies, his personal representative, sustaining damages as a result of an act or omission of the authority or any of its officers, agents, or employees occurring in the exercise of a governmental function, may sue the authority for recovery of damages. To the extent of the coverage of insurance purchased pursuant to this section governmental immunity may not be a defense to the action. Otherwise, however, the authority has all defenses available to private litigants in any action brought pursuant to these provisions without restriction, limitation, or other effect whether the defense arises from common law or by virtue of a statute. 
    Sec. 4. The Sanford-Lee County Regional Airport Authority may exercise the powers granted to municipalities by the terms of G.S. 63-49 et seq. concerning public airports and related facilities. Nothing in this act shall give the authority to condemn land or establish an airport outside the boundaries of Lee County. 
    Sec. 5. In the event of cessation of the operation of an airport established under this act, or the abandonment of any of the property acquired hereunder for airport purposes, the title to such real or personal property, or rights under any existing lease shall revert to and vest in the County of Lee and the City of Sanford, and upon the sale of any property after cessation of operations, the proceeds therefrom shall vest equally in the County of Lee and the City of Sanford. 
    Sec. 6. This act is effective upon ratification.

Sec. 1-5. - Catchlines of sections; history notes and references. 
(a)  The catchlines of the several sections of this Code printed in boldface type are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the section and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, or any part of the section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted.

(Code 1985, § 10.09) 
Sec. 1-7. - General penalty; citations; additional remedies. 
(a)  Unless otherwise provided in this Code, each violation of this Code shall not constitute a misdemeanor, and violations of such provisions of this Code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500.00. 
(b)  Violations of this Code shall constitute either a misdemeanor or, at the election of the city, shall subject the offender to a civil penalty upon the issuance of a citation for the violation as provided in this section. The civil penalty, if not paid to the city within 15 days of the issuance of a citation, may be recovered by the city in a civil action in the nature of debt. Unless otherwise provided by a specific provision of this Code, such civil penalties shall be in the amount of $50.00 for each violation, and each day any single violation continues shall be a separate violation. 
(c)  In addition to the civil penalties set out in subsection (b) of this section, any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. In such case, the state general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application of the city for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law. 
(d)  In addition to the civil penalties set out in subsection (b) of this section, any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance that makes unlawful a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced by injunction and order of abatement by the state general court of justice. When a violation of such a provision occurs, the city may apply to the appropriate division of the general court of justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction or order of abatement commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of the property. The action shall be governed in all respects by the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including the Rules of Civil Procedure in general and Rule 65 in particular. An order of abatement may direct that buildings or other structures on the property be closed, demolished or removed; that fixtures, furniture or other movable property be removed from buildings on the property; that abandoned or junked vehicles be removed; that improvements or repairs be made; or that any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with this Code or such ordinance. If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for contempt, and the city may execute the order of abatement. The city shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic's and materialman's lien. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by the clerk of superior court in an amount approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard, and shall be conditioned on the defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith. 
(e)  The provisions of this Code and any other city ordinances may be enforced by one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this section. However, if the ordinance states that it is enforceable by civil penalty in the nature of debt, it is not enforceable under G.S. 14-4. 
(f)  Any ordinances hereafter adopted by the city council, the violation of which shall incur a penalty, shall specify whether the enforcement shall be pursuant to the civil penalty or criminal penal provisions of this section. If the ordinance states that it is enforceable by civil penalty, it is not enforceable under G.S. 14-4. 
(g)  Upon determination of a violation of any section of this Code, the penalty for which is a civil penalty, the city shall cause a warning citation to be issued to the violator. Such citation shall set out the nature of the violation, the section violated and the date of the violation, and shall contain an order to immediately cease the violation. If the violation is in the nature of an infraction for which an order of abatement would be appropriate in a civil proceeding, a reasonable period of time must be stated in which the violation must be abated. The warning citation shall specify that a second citation shall incur a civil penalty, together with costs and attorney fees. 
(h)  Upon failure of the violator to obey the warning citation, a civil citation shall be issued by the appropriate official of the city and served directly on either the violator, his duly designated agent, or the registered agent if a corporation, either in person or posted in the United States mail service by first class mail addressed to the last known address of the violator as contained in the records of the city or obtained from the violator at the time of issuance of the warning citation. The violator shall be deemed to have been served upon the mailing of the citation. The citation shall direct the violator to appear before the city manager or his designee within 15 days of the date of the citation, or alternatively to pay the citation by mail. The violation for which the citation is issued must have been corrected by the time the citation is paid, otherwise further citations shall be issued. Citations may be issued for each day the offense continues until the prohibited activity is ceased or abated. 
(i)  If the violator fails to respond to a citation within 15 days of its issuance, and pay the penalty prescribed therein, the city may institute a civil action in the nature of debt in the appropriate division of the state general court of justice for the collection of the penalty, costs and attorney fees and such other relief as permitted by law.

(Code 1985, § 10.18) 
Sec. 1-9. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared on an annual basis. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier, meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement, may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ ," inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code. 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 2-191. - Appointment and term of members; attendance at meetings. 
(a)  Authority of council to fix terms. The council shall fix the terms of office and terms of appointment of all members of all boards, commissions, and committees of the city, whether the boards and commissions were created pursuant to general law, local law, Charter, or ordinance, and regardless of the terms established by general or local law, or Charter provisions, for particular boards and commissions. 
(b)  Applicability. For the purposes of this section, the word "board" shall mean and include any board, commission, committee, agency or similar group made up in whole or in part of nonelected appointees of the council, whether established by general statute, charter, ordinance, resolution, or otherwise. 
(c)  Modification of requirements; conflicting provisions. The procedures established by this section are intended to be a flexible guide for use by the council in the appointment and reappointment process to boards. Because of the need for flexibility, the council may, by majority vote, decide to waive, vary or otherwise modify the requirements of this section on a case by case basis. Unless otherwise required by the General Statutes, where any provision of this article conflicts with any provisions imposed elsewhere in the Code, the provisions of this section shall be deemed to be controlling. 
(d)  Appointments generally; duration of terms. The terms of office of members of all boards shall be three years, and shall begin on July 1 and expire on June 30. Terms on all boards shall be staggered, with the term of approximately one-third of the membership expiring each year, to the end that, insofar as possible, there shall always be one or more members with experience on each board. All terms shall begin on July 1, next following appointment. All appointments to all boards shall be made by the council as a whole, and neither the power to appoint nor the power to recommend persons for appointment shall be delegated to any board or to any committee of the council. No person shall serve on more than one board at the same time. A person shall normally serve no more than two consecutive full terms on the same board. However, the council may waive this requirement on a case by case basis. All members of all boards shall serve at the pleasure of the council regardless of the terms for which appointed, and the council may in its discretion at any time remove any members of any board. 
(e)  Application for initial appointment. In order to be eligible for initial appointment to a board, a person must file a written application on a form provided by the city clerk, setting forth name, address, and the name of the board to which appointment is desired. The application shall also include an affirmative statement that the applicant is a registered voter in the city. The application may be accompanied by any additional written information which the applicant wishes the council to consider, other than letters of reference and petitions of others advocating the appointment. In order to be considered by the council, an application must be filed with the city clerk not later than June 1 preceding the beginning of the term for which the appointment is desired. This subsection shall not apply to appointments to fill unexpired portions of terms to fill vacancies. 
(f)  Public notice of vacancies. The city clerk shall cause a notice to be posted in one or more conspicuous locations at city hall at all times during the months of January, February, and March of each year. This notice shall specify the vacancies which will exist on boards, and will set forth the details of subsection (e) regarding the application procedure and the deadline for receipt of applications for appointment. 
(g)  Procedure for reappointment. During the month of December of each year, the chairpersons shall notify all members of their boards whose terms expire June 30 of the following year informing them that they must notify the chairperson by February 1 if they wish to be considered for reappointment. The chairperson will then submit a written list of those members who wish to be reappointed to the city clerk by March 15 of each year. 
(h)  Consideration of applications. Copies of all applications received by the city clerk by June 1 in a year shall be distributed during the month of June to each member of the council along with a list of the board members with expiring terms who wish to be reappointed. The council as a whole shall consider all applications received for appointment to all boards, and shall make such appointments as it deems appropriate. These appointments shall be made at the second meeting in June of each year. Applications received shall be kept on file until December 31 of the year received. To be considered for appointment, all applications must be filed during the year the appointment is to be made. 
(i)  Filling unexpired portions of terms. The council intends to make appointments to fill unexpired portions of terms, created by vacancies, as expeditiously as needed. Further, the council recognizes that the urgency of filling such vacancies may vary depending upon the circumstances of the vacancy. 
(j)  Attendance at meetings. Although recognizing and appreciating the fact that members of the boards are generally citizen volunteers, the council deems it essential that members of all boards attend meetings regularly for the prompt and efficient transaction of city affairs. The chairperson of each board shall maintain attendance records on a form provided by the city clerk and shall forward a copy of this attendance record to the city clerk immediately following each board meeting. 
(k)  Paragraphs (e), (f), (g) and (h) shall not apply to appointments made prior to December 31, 1994.

    Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations prescribed in this article and any other regulations applicable to the same area, whether the conflict be with respect to the height of structures or trees, the use of land, or any other matter, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern and prevail. 
(Ord. No. 1994-14, § X, 4-19-1994) 
Sec. 6-46. - Surface zones established. 
    In order to carry out the provisions of this article, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the non-precision instrument approach surface, the precision instrument approach surfaces, the transitional surfaces, the horizontal surfaces and the conical surfaces as they apply to the airport. Such zones are shown on the Sanford/Lee County Airport Hazard Map, consisting of one sheet or file, prepared by Hobbs, Upchurch and Associates, P.A., and dated January 1994, which is made a part of this article by reference (this same map is also considered page 3 of 7 of the Sanford/Lee County Regional Airport Master Plan). An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Primary surface zone. The primary surface zone is hereby established as the area longitudinally centered on a runway. The width of the primary surface is 1,000 feet and the length extends 200 feet beyond each end of the runway. 
(2)  Non-precision instrument (NPI) approach surface zone. The inner width of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet. The non-precision approach surface zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet at a horizontal distance 10,000 feet from the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(3)  Precision instrument approach surface zone. The inner width of this approach surface zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet. The precision instrument approach surface zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. The precision instrument approach surface zone is further extended from a width of 4,000 feet where it intersects the horizontal surface to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. 
(4)  Transitional surface zones. These zones are hereby established as the area beneath the transitional surfaces. These surfaces extend outward and upward at 90-degree angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces. Transitional surface zones for those portions of the precision approach surface zones which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach zones and at 90-degree angles to the extended runway centerline. 
(5)  Horizontal surface zone. The horizontal surface zone is hereby established by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway, and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal surface zones does not include the approach and transitional surface zones. 
(6)  Conical surface zones. The conical surface zones are hereby established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal surface zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The conical surface zone does not include the precision instrument approach surface zones and the transitional surface zones. 
(Ord. No. 1994-14, § III, 4-19-1994) 
Sec. 6-47. - Surface zone height limitations. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any zone created by this article to a height in excess of the applicable height limit established in this section for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
(1)  Non-precision instrument (NPI) approach surface zone. Slopes upward 34 feet horizontally for each one foot vertically beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline. 
(2)  Precision instrument approach surface zone. Slopes upward 50 feet horizontally for each one foot vertically beginning at the end of, and at the same elevation as, the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline. The slope then extends upward 40 feet horizontally for each one foot vertically to a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. 
(3)  Transitional surface zone. Slopes upward and outward seven feet horizontally for each one foot vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surfaces, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation. In addition, there are established height limits sloping upward and outward seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surfaces, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface or 5,000 feet from the extended precision instrument approach surface. 
(4)  Horizontal surface zone. One hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation. 
(5)  Conical surface zone. Slopes upward and outward 20 feet horizontally for each one foot vertically beginning at the periphery of the horizontal surface and at 150 feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation. 
(Ord. No. 1994-14, § IV, 4-19-1994) 
Sec. 6-48. - Use restrictions. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this article in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, or otherwise in any way create a hazard or endanger the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport, including generation of dust and debris, and stockpiling of materials which may attract large flocks of birds. 
(Ord. No. 1994-14, § V, 4-19-1994) 
Sec. 6-49. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained in this article shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to such effective date, and is diligently prosecuted. 
(b)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Sanford/Lee County Airport Authority to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of Sanford/Lee County Airport Authority. 
(Ord. No. 1994-14, § VI, 4-19-1994) 
Sec. 6-50. - Permits. 
(a)  New uses. Except as specifically provided in subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection, no material changes shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone created by this article unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations prescribed in this article. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with section 6-44. 
(1)  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal surface zone and conical surface zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet in vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
(2)  In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than 10,000 feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet in vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach surface zones. 
(3)  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal surface zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet in vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition surface zones. 
Nothing contained in any of the exceptions in this subsection shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree, in excess of any of the height limits established by this article, except as set forth in section 6-48. 
(b)  Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived or of any amendments to this article, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the city zoning administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(d)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the board of appeals for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the board of adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Sanford/Lee County Regional Airport Authority for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the airport authority does not respond to the application within 90 days after receipt, the board of appeals may act on its own to grant or deny the application. 
(e)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and may be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of appeals, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the Sanford/Lee County Regional Airport Authority, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary markings and lights. 
(Ord. No. 1994-14, § VII, 4-19-1994)

Sec. 8-13. - Inspections. 
(a)  For the purpose of making inspections, the code enforcement officer is authorized to enter, examine and survey at all reasonable times all non-residential structures and/or abandoned structures and the premises associated therewith. The owner or occupant of every non-residential structure or abandoned structure, or the person in charge thereof, shall give the code enforcement officer free access to the structure and its premises at all reasonable times for the purposes of inspection, examination and survey. 
(b)  Every occupant of a non-residential structure shall give the owner thereof or his agent or employee access to any part of the structure and its premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of making any repairs or alterations as are necessary to effect compliance with the provisions of this chapter or with any lawful order issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
    NOTE: When permission to inspect a non-residential structure or abandoned structure or its premises is denied, the code enforcement officer must obtain a warrant to inspect, pursuant to G.S. § 15-27.2 which provides for the issuance of warrants for the conduct of inspections authorized by law. The state court of appeals in In Re Dwelling, 24 N.C. App. 17 (1974), has held that the consent of the tenant-occupant who was in actual possession and control of the premises was sufficient to authorize an inspection without a warrant, notwithstanding the fact that the owner has objected to the warrantless search. When faced with a situation where permission to inspect is denied, code enforcement officers are advised to seek the advice of the city attorney. 
(Ord. No. 2014-39, 8-5-2014) 
Sec. 8-14. - Method of service of complaints and order. 
    Complaints or orders issued by the code enforcement officer shall be served upon persons either personally or by registered or certified mail.

Service shall be deemed sufficient if the registered or certified mail is refused, but the regular mail is not returned by the post office within ten days after the mailing. If regular mail is used, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises affected. If the identities of any owners or the whereabouts of persons are unknown and cannot be ascertained by the code enforcement officer in the exercise of reasonable diligence, and the code enforcement officer makes an affidavit to that effect, the serving of the complaint or order upon the owners or other persons may be made by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the city at least once no later than the time that personal service would be required under this section. When service is made by publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises affected. 
(Ord. No. 2014-39, 8-5-2014)

The owner shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. Any person desiring to do so may attend such hearing and give evidence relevant to the matter being heard. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the code enforcement officer. Following the hearing, the code enforcement officer shall dismiss the complaint if he finds no violation; if he finds that violations of this article exist, he shall order compliance setting forth a maximum of up to 180 days within which to correct the violations. Such order shall contain an outline of remedial action which, if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of this article. 
(b)  If the code enforcement officer determines that the repairs, alterations or improvements necessary to bring the building into compliance with the provisions of this article can be made at a cost of less than 50 percent ofthe present value ofthe building, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof, an order directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter and improve such building to comply with the standards contained herein.

(2)  Cause to be posted on the main entrance of any structure so closed, a placard entitled, "Notice of condemnation" with the following words: "Notice is hereby given that this building is unsafe and dangerous condition; may constitute a fire hazard by reason of structural defects and general state of decay, deterioration and disrepair; may be hazardous or dangerous to children or members of the public generally, or may be dangerously infested with vermin rodents or insects. Such building has been condemned under the building laws of the State of North Carolina and the City of Sanford". 
(b)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the building or structure, the code enforcement officer shall; 
(1)  Cause such structure to be removed or demolished; 
(2)  Cause to be posted, pending demolition, on the main entrance of any structure so closed, a placard entitled, "notice of condemnation" with the following words: "notice is hereby given that this building is unsafe and dangerous condition; may constitute a fire hazard by reason of structural defects and general state of decay, deterioration and disrepair; may be hazardous or dangerous to children or members of the public generally, or may be dangerously infested with vermin rodents or insects.

b.  The amount of the cost of repairs, alterations and improvements, or vacating, closing and removal or demolition shall be a lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred. Such lien shall be filed, have the same priority and be collected as the lien for special assessment provided in Article 10, Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes. If the nonresidential building or structure is removed or demolished by the code enforcement officer, he or she shall offer for sale the recoverable materials of the building or structure and any personal property, fixtures, or appurtenances found in or attached to the building or structure and shall credit the proceeds of the sale, if any, against the cost of the removal or demolition, and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court by the public officer, shall be secured in a manner directed by the court, and shall be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of the court. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the City of Sanford to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise. 
c.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise, nor shall enforcement of one remedy provided herein prevent the enforcement of any other remedies provided herein or otherwise. 
d.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the building inspector in the proper enforcement of the duties of his office, as assigned, nor shall the enforcement of one remedy provided herein prevent the enforcement of any other remedies provided herein or otherwise.

Sec. 8-17. - Appeals.

Any appeal from the code enforcement officer shall be taken within ten days from the rendering of the decision, or if either the owner or his attorney was not present when the decision was rendered, then within ten days of service of such order. Such appeal shall be taken by filing with the code enforcement officer and with the City of Sanford Board of Adjustment (hereinafter called "the board") a notice of appeal which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the code enforcement officer shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from a decision of the code enforcement officer refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a decision of the code enforcement officer requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the board, unless the code enforcement officer certifies to the board after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished to the appellant), a suspension of this requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, the requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause upon not less than ten days' written notice to the code enforcement officer by the board, or by a court of record. 
(b)  Appeals to the board of adjustment shall follow the procedures as set forth in Sections 3.1.5.3 and 3.8.3 of the Sanford/Lee County Unified Development Ordinance.

(c)  Each day that a violation continues after notification that such violation exists shall constitute a separate and distinct offense for purposes of the penalties and remedies set forth in this section.

(Code 1985, § 151.01) 
Sec. 20-32. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Code 1985, § 151.02) 
Sec. 20-33. - Purpose of article. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwater; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwater or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Code 1985, § 151.03) 
Sec. 20-34. - Objectives of article. 
    The objectives of this article are as follows: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a floodprone area.

(4)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 20-38 are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwater, which carries debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following provisions shall apply within such areas: 
a.  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development, shall be permitted unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
b.  If subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
c.  No manufactured homes shall be permitted except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of section 20-81(2) and the elevation standards of subsection (1) of this section are met.

ARTICLE III. - ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 22-61. - Powers and duties of code enforcement officer. 
    The code enforcement officer is designated as the officer to enforce the provisions of this chapter and to exercise the duties and powers prescribed in this article. The code enforcement officer is authorized to exercise such powers as may be necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate the purpose and provisions of this chapter. The code enforcement officer shall have the following powers and duties: 
(1)  Investigate the dwelling conditions, and to inspect dwellings, dwelling units, structures and abandoned structures located in the city, in order to determine which dwellings, dwelling units, structures and abandoned structures are unfit for human habitation, and for the purpose of carrying out the objectives of this chapter with respect to the repair, closing or demolition of such dwellings, dwelling units, structures and abandoned structures; 
(2)  Take such action, together with other appropriate departments and agencies, public and private, as may be necessary to effect rehabilitation of housing which is deteriorated; 
(3)  Keep a record of the results of inspections made under this chapter and an inventory of those dwellings, dwelling units, structures and abandoned structures that do not meet the minimum standard of fitness herein prescribed; 
(4)  Administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence; 
(5)  Enter on premises for the purpose of making examinations and inspections; provided the entries shall be made in accordance with section 22-62 and state law, and shall be made in such a manner as to cause the least possible inconvenience to the persons in possession; 
(6)  Appoint and fix the duties of such officers, agents and employees as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter, and to delegate any of his functions and powers to those officers, agents and employees; 
(7)  Perform such other duties as may be prescribed in this article. 
(Ord. No. 1998-44, § 152.30, 11-17-1998) 
Sec. 22-62. - Inspections. 
(a)  For the purpose of making inspections, the code enforcement officer is authorized to enter, examine and survey at all reasonable times all dwellings, dwelling units, roominghouses, rooming units, structures and abandoned structures and the premises associated therewith. The owner or occupant of every dwelling, dwelling unit, roominghouse, rooming unit, structure or abandoned structure, or the person in charge thereof, shall give the code enforcement officer free access to the dwelling, dwelling unit or structure and its premises at all reasonable times for the purposes of inspection, examination and survey. 
(b)  Every occupant of a dwelling, dwelling unit, roominghouse, rooming unit or structure shall give the owner thereof or his agent or employee access to any part of the dwelling, dwelling unit or structure and its premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of making any repairs or alterations as are necessary to effect compliance with the provisions of this chapter or with any lawful order issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
NOTE: When permission to inspect a dwelling, dwelling unit, structure or abandoned structure or its premises is denied, the code enforcement officer must obtain a warrant to inspect, pursuant to G.S. 15-27.2 which provides for the issuance of warrants for the conduct of inspections authorized by law. The state court of appeals in In Re Dwelling , 24 N.C. App. 17 (1974), has held that the consent of the tenant-occupant who was in actual possession and control of the premises was sufficient to authorize an inspection without a warrant, notwithstanding the fact that the owner has objected to the warrantless search. When faced with a situation where permission to inspect is denied, code enforcement officers are advised to seek the advice of the city attorney. 
(Ord. No. 1998-44, § 152.31, 11-17-1998)

ARTICLE III. - GRAFFITI 

Sec. 26-71. - Purpose and intent. 
    The city council is enacting this article to help prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and private property. The council is authorized to enact this article pursuant to its police powers, in order to promote health, safety and welfare of its citizens, under the Charter of the City of Sanford and N.C.G.S. ch. 160A. 
    The council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless the city acts to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city. 
    The city council intends, through the adoption of this article, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement. The council does not intend for this article to conflict with any existing anti-graffiti state laws.

Sec. 38-7. - Relocation of water meters. 
(a)  At the request of the property owner, the city will relocate installed water meters upon deposit with the city, in advance, of the estimated cost for such relocation. The city engineer's estimate for relocation costs shall be final.

Sec. 38-9. - Maintenance of sewer laterals. 
(a)  When a sewer lateral has been set in place, it becomes the responsibility of the property owner to maintain it. Because a stoppage is usually in the small lateral and not in the main line, the policy of the city is that it is the responsibility of the property owner to procure a plumber to unstop the line unless there is some definite indication that the sewer main has a stoppage. If it is determined that the lateral is clear and that the stoppage is in the main line, the plumber should promptly report his findings to the sewer maintenance superintendent. At that time the main line will be checked and cleared. If the main line is clear, the city will assume no responsibility for any lateral and under no circumstance will the city maintenance crew be allowed to go on private property and unstop a sewer lateral. 
(b)  The policy stated in subsection (a) of this section shall be applicable on all road projects, both finished and under construction, except that when, during construction, it is necessary to move and replace certain laterals, they will be replaced by the city, or by the contractor under city inspection, with utmost care. Immediately upon proper completion of any such lateral, it will again revert to the property owner's responsibility. 
(c)  When it becomes necessary to repair or replace a sewer lateral or connection, the property owner shall deposit with the revenue officer an amount equal to the cost of a new sewer lateral or connection. The work will be performed by the city maintenance crew, and upon completion any unused funds will be reimbursed to the property owner. 
(d)  When a residential property owner has had a cleanout installed at the street right-of-way line, and the installation has been inspected and approved by the city, the portion of the lateral from the street right-of-way to the sewer main in the street will become the responsibility of the city to maintain.

Sec. 38-10. - Stopcocks, waste cocks and curb cocks. 
(a)  A stopcock and waste cock and cutoff valve shall be placed by the property owner at the property line or at such point where the pipe leaves the street line. The cock or valve shall be under the control of the tenant or owner, to be used in case of breakage or other necessity whereby pipes to be repaired can be cut off without the necessity for using the street corporation cutoff. This is not intended to take the place of an ordinary stopcock and waste cock located within the premises, to be used to drain the pipes to prevent damage by freezing. As many additional stopcocks and waste cocks as desired by the owner may be placed within the premises, to be used according to desire or convenience. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any unauthorized person to interfere with the valves on the street mains or curb cocks of any part of the waterworks system. However, plumbers may, in case of accident, shut off water at curb cocks.

All new in-ground irrigation systems installed after application of this section which will be supplied water from the City of Sanford water system shall be independently connected to the system and water consumption shall be measured through a separate irrigation meter. 
(b)  Tap requirements. An irrigation service line shall be installed by a direct tap into the main (separate tap) or by a split-line off the non-irrigation service line at a point between the main and non-irrigation meter (split tap). The type of connection permitted, whether separate or split, shall be determined by the City of Sanford's Public Works Department. Either method of connection shall be performed by or under the direction of the City of Sanford's Public Works Water Construction and Maintenance Department. 
(c)  Installation. An irrigation service line, the irrigation meter, and all related appurtenances shall be installed in accordance with the same regulations, policies and procedures that apply to non-irrigation meters.

(b)  The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Prevent the introduction of pollutants and wastewater discharges into the municipal wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge; 
(2)  Prevent the introduction of pollutants and wastewater discharges into the municipal wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into any waters of the state or otherwise be incompatible with the system; 
(3)  Promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludges from the municipal system; 
(4)  Protect municipal personnel who may be affected by sewage, sludge and effluent in the course of their employment, as well as protecting the general public; 
(5)  Provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance and improvement of the municipal wastewater system; and 
(6)  Ensure that the city complies with its NPDES or non-discharge permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any other federal or state laws to which the municipal wastewater system is subject. 
(c)  This article provides for the regulation of direct and indirect contributors to the municipal wastewater system, through the issuance of permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement of general requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires user reporting and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established in this article. 
(d)  This article shall apply to all users of the municipal wastewater system, as authorized by G.S. 160A-312 and/or 153A-275. The city shall designate an administrator of the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) and pretreatment program. Except as otherwise provided in this article, the POTW director shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this article. Any powers granted to or imposed upon the POTW director may be delegated by the POTW director to other city personnel. 
By discharging wastewater into the city wastewater system, industrial users located within or outside the city limits agree to comply with the terms and conditions established in this article, as well as any permits, enforcement actions or orders issued under this article. This includes all industrial users discharging in the wastewater collection system owned by any satellite POTW.

The POTW director/superintendent is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period, also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection (a)(4) of this section. 
(3)  Show cause hearing. 
a.  The POTW director/superintendent may order any industrial user who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this article or is in noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. If the POTW director/superintendent determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
b.  The POTW director/superintendent shall review the evidence presented at the hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate. 
c.  A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to the assessment of a civil penalty under subsection (b) of this section, nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW director/superintendent under this section subject to an administrative appeal under section 38-310. 
(4)  Administrative orders. When the POTW director/superintendent finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article, permits or orders issued under this article, or any other pretreatment requirement, the POTW director/superintendent may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to do any of the following: 
a.  Immediately comply with all requirements. 
b.  Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in the order. 
c.  Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a continuing or threatened violation.

b.  Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user's waste discharge permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the POTW director/superintendent shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The POTW director/superintendent shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the POTW director/superintendent prior to the date of the hearing described in this subsection. 
(6)  Termination of permit or permission to discharge. The POTW director/superintendent may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
a.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge; 
b.  Failure to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
c.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or 
d.  Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to discharge, conditions of this article, or any applicable state and federal regulations. 
Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (a) of this section why the proposed action should not be taken.

Sec. 38-225. - Annual publication of significant noncompliance. 
    At least annually, the POTW director/superintendent shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW, a list of those industrial users which were found to be in significant noncompliance, also referred to as reportable noncompliance, in 15A NCAC 2H .0903(b)(10), with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements, during the previous 12 months. 
(Ord. No. 2008-52, 9-16-2008; Ord. No. 2013-01, 1-15-2013) 
Sec. 38-226. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset. 
(1)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (a)(2) of this section are met. 
(2)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through proper contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence, that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the POTW director/superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally; a written submission must be provided within five days: 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(3)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(4)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(5)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of the user's treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, is lost, or fails. 
(b)  Prohibited discharge standards defense. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 38-241(a) or the specific prohibitions in section 38-241(b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(5) through (7), (b)(9) through (22), (c), (d) and (e) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c)(2), (3) and (4) of this section. 
(2)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW director/superintendent, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(3)  A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW director/superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW director/superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(4)  Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW director/superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c)(2) of this section. 
(5)  The POTW director/superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW director/superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (c)(4) of this section.

DIVISION 3. - FEES AND CHARGES 

Sec. 38-271. - Generally. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for the recovery of costs from users of the wastewater disposal system of the city for the implementation of the program established in this article. The applicable charges or fees shall be set forth in a schedule of sewer use charges and fees by the POTW director and approved by the city board. A copy of these charges and fees will be made available from the POTW director. 
(Ord. No. 2008-52, 9-16-2008; Ord. No. 2013-01, 1-15-2013) 
Sec. 38-272. - User charges. 
(a)  Applicability. A user charge shall be levied on all users, including but not limited to persons, firms, corporations or governmental entities, that discharge, cause or permit the discharge of sewage into the POTW. 
(b)  Costs included. The user charge shall reflect at least the cost of debt service and operation and maintenance (including replacement) of the POTW. 
(c)  Basis and calculation. Each user shall pay its proportionate cost based on volume of flow. 
(d)  Review. The city shall review annually the sewage contributions of users and the total costs of debt service and operation and maintenance of the POTW and will make recommendations to the council for adjustments in the schedule of charges and fees as necessary. 
(e)  Charges for flow not directly attributable to users. Charges for flow to the POTW not directly attributable to the users shall be distributed among all users of the POTW based upon the volume of flow of the users. 
(f)  Measurement of water usage. When charges and fees are based on the water usage, the charges and fees shall be applied against the total amount of water used from all sources, public and private, determined by means of the user and approved by the city, adding the private sources' volume to the metered water consumption. 
(Ord. No. 2008-52, 9-16-2008; Ord. No. 2013-01, 1-15-2013) 
Sec. 38-273. - Surcharges generally. 
    The amount of the surcharges will be based upon the volume of flow and the character and concentration of the constituents of the wastewater: 
(1)  Determination of flow; credit for water not returned to sewer. 
a.  The volume of flow used in determining the total discharge of wastewater for payment of user charges and surcharges shall be based on the following: 
1.  Metered water consumption as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the city; or 
2.  If required by the city, or at the individual discharger's option, other flow-monitoring devices which measure the actual volume of wastewater discharged to the sewer. Such devices shall be accessible and safely located, and the measuring system shall be installed in accordance with plans approved by the city. The metering system shall be installed and maintained at the user's expense according to arrangements that may be made with the city. 
b.  Where any user procures all or part of his water supply from sources other than the city, the user shall install and maintain, at his own expense, a flow-measuring device of a type approved by the city. 
c.  If the discharger elects to be billed for wastewater volume by a wastewater flow-monitoring device as provided in this article, the flow-monitoring device will be inspected and certified for accuracy each quarter of the calendar year by a city-approved technician at the discharger's expense. Failure to inspect and to provide the certification will result in the use of the water meter readings for calculation of charges by the city. City sewer customers are billed based on 100 percent of the water volume meters; however, the rate charged is set to reflect a savings to the discharger for 20 percent of water not returned to the sewer. Dischargers that wish to receive credit in excess of the 20 percent allowance built in the rates may use readings of a flow-monitoring device. For any readings below 80 percent, the discharger may receive credit not to exceed a total credit of ten percent. In cases where the reading is below 70 percent of the water usage, the discharger will be given only the ten percent credit unless detailed calculations are submitted to and approved by the city manager annually verifying that such flow-monitoring device reading is reasonable and expected. Dischargers shall be charged for 100 percent of the water used when the reading of the flow-monitoring device reflects a volume returned greater than 80 percent of the water meter reading. In no case shall dischargers be billed at a volume greater than 100 percent of the water volume supplied from all sources. 
(2)  Sampling of wastewater. The character and concentration of the constituents of the wastewater used in determining surcharges shall be determined by samples collected and analyzed by the city. Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of the actual discharge and shall be analyzed using procedures set forth in 40 CFR 136. 
(3)  Determination of wastewater constituents. The determination of the character and concentration of the constituents of the wastewater discharge by the POTW director/superintendent or his duly appointed representatives shall be binding as a basis for charges.

Sec. 38-274. - Pretreatment program administration charges. 
    The schedule of charges and fees adopted by the city under this article may include charges and fees for: 
(1)  Reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the pretreatment program. 
(2)  Monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures. 
(3)  Reviewing slug control plans, including accidental and/or slug load discharge procedures and construction plans and specifications. 
(4)  Permitting. 
(5)  Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements of the pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 2008-52, 9-16-2008; Ord. No. 2013-01, 1-15-2013) 
Sec. 38-275. - Calculation of surcharges. 
    The basis for determination of surcharges under this article is as follows: 
(1)  Characteristics of domestic wastewater. Charges and fees shall be based upon a minimum basic charge for each premises, computed on the basis of wastewater from domestic premises with the following characteristics: 
a.  CBOD: 250 mg/l. 
b.  Total suspended solids: 200 mg/l. 
c.  Oil and grease: 40 mg/l. 
d.  Volume: 375 gallons per day per domestic premises. 
(2)  Classification of users. All users are to be classified by the city either by assigning each one to a user classification category according to the principal activity conducted on the user's premises, by individual user analyzation, or by a combination thereof. The purpose of such collective or individual classification is to facilitate the regulation of wastewater discharges based on wastewater constituents and characteristics to provide an effective means of source control, and to establish a system of charges and fees which will ensure an equitable recovery of the city's cost. 
(3)  Basis of surcharge for nondomestic users. The charges and fees for all classifications of users other than domestic premises shall be based on the relative difference between the average wastewater constituents and characteristics of that classification as related to those of domestic premises. 
(4)  Basis of charges for permit users. The charges and fees established for permit users shall be based on the measured or estimated constituents and characteristics of the wastewater discharge of that user, which may include but shall not be limited to CBOD, COD, oil and grease, chlorine demand and volume. 
(5)  Calculation of charges. The charges for excesses of the constituents listed in this section will be based upon the mass emission rate of those constituents and determined thusly: 
a.  Mass emission rate shall be determined as follows: 
Mass Emission Rate, MER ( ) = MG × C × 8.34 
Where: 
MER is the mass emission rate in pounds of a particular constituent. 
MG is millions of gallons of wastewater. 
C is the concentration in mg/l of the particular constituent being charged for (as an example, CBOD, COD, etc.). 
8.34 is equal to the number of pounds per one gallon of water. 
b.  The amount of the charge in dollars will be calculated thusly: 
Ao = R × MER ( ) 
Where: 
Ao is equal to the amount of the charge in dollars. 
R is equal to the rate of charge per pound of constituent. 
MER ( ) is equal to the pounds of a constituent. 
c.  An example of surcharge determination is as follows: Cannon's Corporation is a producer of canned fruits. They discharged 1,000,000 gallons of wastewater in the month of January. Analysis found that the wastewater has the following characteristics: CBOD = 400 mg/l, TSS = 950 mg/l. There were no other limitations exceeded in this example. There were 100 employees employed at the cannery. The limits of CBOD and TSS are 250 mg/l and 200 mg/l respectively. 
The MER of CBOD is equal to: 
MERCBOD = (400 - 250) × 8.34 × 1 MG 
= (150) × 8.34 × 1 
= 1,121 lbs. of CBOD or 1.121 thousand lbs. CBOD;xhg; 
If the charge for CBOD is R = $145.00/1,000 lbs. CBOD, then the total charge for CBOD is equal to: 
Ao = R × MER 
Ao = $145.00 × 1.121 
Ao = $162.55 
If the charge for TSS is $220.00/1,000 lbs., the charge would be computed thusly: 
MERTSS = (950 - 200) × 8.34 × 1 MG 
= 750 × 8.34 × 1 
= 6,255 lbs. TSS or 6.255 thousand lbs. TSS 
At a charge of $220.00/thousand lbs., the charge for TSS = 6.255 × $220.00 = $1,376.10 
Total surcharge for January = $162.55 + $1,376.10 = $1,538.65

Sec. 38-276. - Method of determining rates. 
(a)  The council will annually review the actual cost of operation and maintenance of the city's wastewater treatment plants and adjust the surcharge rates and the volume user charge rate (per 100 cubic feet) to reflect the true cost of constituent treatment. The adjustments, if any, will become effective following the first day of each new fiscal year. The council may review these rates and adjust them accordingly at any time it deems adjustments are in the best interest of the city. 
(b)  The council shall set the surcharge rates and volume user rates from time to time and a schedule of such rates is on file in the city offices. 
(Ord. No. 2008-52, 9-16-2008; Ord. No. 2013-01, 1-15-2013) 
Sec. 38-277. - Industrial cost recovery. 
(a)  Applicability. 
(1)  This section shall be applicable only to industrial users of those portions of the city's treatment works funded (in whole or in part) by a federal grant awarded after March 1, 1973, when required by section 204(b)(1)(B) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. 
(2)  Each year during the industrial cost recovery period, each industrial user of the city's treatment works shall pay to the city such user's share of the total amount of the applicable federal grant and any grant amendment, divided by the recovery period. 
(b)  Determination of payments. 
(1)  Generally. The industrial cost recovery period and each industrial user's share of industrial cost recovery (IRC payments) shall be fixed by the city manager, after consultation with the public works director, in accordance with the methods and procedures set forth in 40 CFR 35, subpart E, February 11, 1974, and Industrial Cost Recovery Systems, Publication No. MCD-45, by the Environmental Protection Agency, February 1976. 
(2)  Selection of method or procedure. Except as expressly provided in this section, whenever those rules, regulations or guidelines provided for permit alternative methods or procedures, the city manager shall select those methods or procedures which in his judgment will ensure that the proper amount of federal funds are recovered from industrial users and that each industrial user is treated fairly and consistently and assessed industrial cost recovery payments in accordance with applicable law and generally accepted accounting principles. 
(3)  Factors to be considered. The city manager must take the following into consideration in computing an individual industrial user's industrial cost recovery payment: 
a.  If an industrial user's maximum flow (hourly, daily, monthly, seasonally, and the like) contributes to the cost of construction of the treatment works, it shall be the basis of that user's industrial cost recovery payment. No credit shall be given to the industrial user for the time period when the user is not operating and is not discharging water. 
b.  Uncontaminated cooling waters discharged into the city's treatment facilities are declared to be process wastes and must be included in computing industrial cost recovery payments. 
c.  The cost of building unreserved excess capacity into the city's treatment facility shall not be recovered from existing industrial users. 
d.  Only those costs which can be related to the construction or preparation for construction of the city's treatment facilities will be subject to industrial cost recovery. 
e.  Industrial users discharging pretreated processed wastes into the city's treatment facilities must pay industrial cost recovery based on the characteristics of the pretreated wastes. 
(4)  Reservation of capacity. Industrial users may reserve capacity in the city's treatment works through a formal, written agreement. In such cases, the following will apply: 
a.  The industrial user shall pay to the city the full industrial cost recovery applicable to the capacity reserved; 
b.  If the industrial user exceeds its reserved capacity, it shall be required to pay industrial cost recovery calculated on the full reserve capacity plus additional industrial cost recovery for use above the limits of the reserve capacity or any element thereof; 
c.  If the treatment works are expanded in the future with Public Law 92-500 grant assistance, an industrial user who has executed a reserve capacity agreement and has made industrial cost payments based on full reserved capacity will not incur additional industrial cost recovery payments associated with the cost of expansion until such user's actual use of the treatment works exceeds its reserved capacity; and 
d.  Industrial users shall pay additional industrial charges associated with the cost of upgrading treatment works. 
(c)  Exempt industrial users. Anything in this section to the contrary notwithstanding, industrial cost recovery shall not be charged to or collected from any industrial user that discharges into the city's system only non-process, segregated domestic wastes, or wastes from sanitary conveniences, and which is not a significant industrial user as defined in 40 CFR 403.3. 
(d)  New industries. Industrial cost recovery payments for new industries shall begin on the date use is initiated, and shall continue for the unexpired portion of the applicable industrial cost recovery period or until the industry ceases use of the facility, whichever occurs first. The new industry shall pay to the city its share of the total amount of the applicable federal grant and any grant amendment multiplied by the ratio of its period of use to the industrial cost recovery period. For the purpose of this section, a new industry is one which connects to the city's treatment works after the treatment works have been put into service. 
(e)  Monitoring of wastewater characteristics. 
(1)  In developing the industrial cost recovery system, the wastewater characteristics of each industrial user shall be determined by monitoring or, when the city manager finds that monitoring is not feasible, by estimating using historical records, data from similar industrial users, and the like. 
(2)  After the industrial cost recovery system is placed into operation, major industrial users shall be monitored on a regular basis, not less often than annually; minor industries may be monitored on a random basis. 
(3)  Monitoring shall be conducted during periods of normal discharge. 
(4)  For the purposes of this subsection, a major industry shall mean one which discharges more than five percent of the total design capacity of any wastewater characteristics used in determining industrial cost recovery payments, and a minor industry shall mean any industry which is not a major industry. 
(f)  Discontinuance of use of treatment works; termination of reserved capacity. If an industrial user discontinues use of the city's treatment works or terminates its agreement with the city for reserved capacity, then it shall not be liable to the city for further industrial cost recovery payments. Other industries using the city's treatment works will not be required to assume that portion of industrial cost recovery payments which is unrecovered due to the departure of an industrial user. Any significant industrial user planning to discontinue its use of the treatment facility during the industrial cost recovery period must make its intention known in a letter of intent as required under 40 CFR 403.3. 
(g)  Lump sum payments. An industrial user may make a single lump sum payment to fulfill its industrial cost recovery obligation in lieu of periodic payments. The lump sum payments shall not relieve the industrial user of making additional payments should its wastewater flow or load increase. The city shall not grant any discounts from the total industrial cost recovery requirement to industrial users making advance industrial cost recovery payments. 
(h)  Implementation of system; disposition of funds. 
(1)  At the time any element of a treatment works funded by an applicable federal construction grant becomes operable, it shall be placed in the industrial cost recovery system, and the industrial cost recovery period will begin from the date of beneficial use by the first industrial user. Immediately after the industrial cost recovery period begins, the city manager will establish the accounting period for the industrial cost recovery system and, not more than 30 days after the industrial cost recovery period begins, will notify the regional administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in writing, of the date of implementation of the industrial cost recovery system. 
(2)  The first payment to the city by the industrial users shall be made not later than 12 months after the beginning of the industrial cost recovery period, and payments shall continue every 12 months thereafter. 
(3)  All funds recovered by the city under this section shall be deposited, accounted for and paid to the Environmental Protection Agency or otherwise used as authorized by it in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 16, Industrial Cost Recovery Systems, Publication No. MCD-45, Environmental Protection Agency, February 1976. 
(i)  Appeals and requests for review. 
(1)  Any industrial user may request the city manager in writing to reconsider the reasonableness of the allocation and industrial cost recovery payments imposed on it. The request shall set forth in detail why the user deems the allocation or industrial cost recovery payments unreasonable. Within 30 days after receipt of the request, the city manager shall furnish in writing to the user the results of his reconsideration. If the user is not satisfied with the reconsideration, the user may appeal the decision of the city manager to the council, provided that written notice of appeal shall be filed with the city clerk not later than 30 days from the date the user receives the report from the city manager. 
(2)  Any person affected by the industrial cost recovery system may request in writing that the council review the city's administration of the city's industrial cost recovery system. The request shall specify the area to be reviewed and shall identify the methods, practices and procedures which are being challenged. The request for review shall be filed with the city clerk. 
(3)  Within 30 days from the receipt of an appeal under subsection (i)(1) of this section or a request for review under subsection (i)(2) of this section, the council shall grant a hearing to the applicant. The procedure for conducting the hearing, rendering the decision, and appellate review shall be as set forth by the city from time to time. The decision of the council shall be final as to all administrative matters.

Sec. 38-339. - Notification of discharge of hazardous waste. 
    Wastes not permitted to be discharged into the community sewer must be transported to a state-approved disposal site. In case of a spill, the following applies: 
(1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days before the discharge commences. The user shall not begin the discharge until receiving written approval from the city. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 38-335. The notification requirements in this section do not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 38-331, 38-333 and 38-334. 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (1) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW director/superintendent, the EPA regional waste management waste division director and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This section does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

(a)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(b)  Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other pollutants as required by 40 CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the number of grabs necessary to be representative of the user's discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5) for additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and 90-day compliance reports. Additionally, the POTW director/superintendent may allow collection of multiple grabs during a 24-hour period which are composited prior to analysis as allowed under 40 CFR 136. 
(c)  Composite samples. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected with a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW director/superintendent. When authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented.

Sec. 40-1. - Authority for enactment. 
    The legislature of the state has delegated the responsibility or directed local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. The council does hereby ordain and enact this chapter into law as the watershed protection ordinance of the city. 
(Ord. No. 1993-19, § 155.001, 6-29-1993) 
Sec. 40-2. - Definitions and rules of construction. 
(a)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

See the NCDOT publication, Best Management Practices for the Protection of Surface Waters, June 1991. 
    Buffer means an area of natural or planted vegetation through which stormwater runoff flows in a diffuse manner so that the runoff does not become channelized and which provides for infiltration of the runoff and filtering of pollutants. The buffer is measured landward from the normal pool elevation of impounded structures and from the bank on each side of streams or rivers. 
    Building means any structure having a roof supported by columns or by walls, and intended for shelter, housing or enclosure of persons, animals or property. The connection of two buildings by means of an open porch, breezeway, passageway, carport or other such open structure, with or without a roof, shall not be deemed to make them one building. 
    Built-upon area. Built-upon areas shall include that portion of a development project that is covered by impervious or partially impervious cover, including buildings, pavement, gravel roads, recreation facilities (e.g., tennis courts), etc. (Note: Wooden slatted decks and the water area of a swimming pool are considered pervious.) 
    Cluster development means the grouping of buildings in order to conserve land resources and provide for innovation in the design of the project.

Since WS-I watersheds are essentially undeveloped, establishment of a critical area is not required. Local governments may extend the critical area as needed. Major landmarks such as highways or property lines may be used to delineate the outer boundary of the critical area if these landmarks are immediately adjacent to the appropriate outer boundary of one-half mile. 
    Customary home occupation means any use conducted entirely within a dwelling and carried on by the occupants thereof, which use is clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling for residential purposes and does not change the character thereof; provided further that no mechanical equipment is installed or used except as is normally used for domestic or professional purposes, and that not over 25 percent of the total floorspace of any structure is used for the occupation. No home occupation shall be conducted in any accessory building except for the storage and service of a vehicle that is driven off-site, such as a service repair truck, delivery truck, etc.

(1)  The complete waiver of a management requirement. 
(2)  The relaxation, by a factor of more than ten percent, of any management requirement that takes the form of a numerical standard. 
(3)  The relaxation of any management requirement that applies to a development proposal intended to qualify under the high density option. 
    Minor variance means a variance that does not qualify as a major variance. 
    Nonresidential development means all development other than residential development, agriculture and silviculture.

(Ord. No. 1993-19, § 155.405, 6-29-1993) 
Sec. 40-72. - Removal of members; rules of conduct. 
    Members of the watershed review board may be removed by the council for cause, including violation of the following rules: 
(1)  Faithful attendance at meetings of the board and conscientious performance of the duties required of members of the board shall be considered a prerequisite to continuing membership on the board. 
(2)  No board member shall take part in the hearing, consideration or determination of any case in which he is personally or financially interested. For purposes of this section, a board member shall have a financial interest in a case when a decision in the case will cause him or his spouse to experience a direct financial benefit or loss, or will cause a business in which he or his spouse owns a ten percent or greater interest, or is involved in a decision-making role, to experience a direct financial benefit or loss. For purposes of this section, a board member shall have a personal interest in a case when it involves a member of his immediate family (i.e., parent, spouse or child). 
(3)  No board member shall discuss any case with any parties thereto prior to the public hearing on that case; provided, however, that members may receive and/or seek information pertaining to the case from the watershed administrator or any other member of the board, or its secretary or clerk, prior to the hearing. 
(4)  Members of the board shall not express individual opinions on the proper judgment of any case prior to its determination on that case. 
(5)  Members of the board shall give notice to the chairperson at least 48 hours prior to the hearing of any potential conflict of interest which he has in a particular case before the board. 
(6)  No board member shall vote on any matter that decides an application or appeal unless he has attended the public hearing on that application or appeal. 
(Ord. No. 1993-19, § 155.406, 6-29-1993) 
Sec. 40-73. - Powers and duties; variances. 
(a)  Administrative review. The watershed review board shall hear and decide appeals from any decision or determination made by the watershed administrator in the enforcement of this chapter. 
(b)  Variances. The watershed review board shall have the power to authorize, in specific cases, minor variances from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this chapter will result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. In addition, the city shall notify and allow a reasonable comment period for all other local governments having jurisdiction in the designated watershed where the variance is being considered. 
(1)  Application; notification requirements. Applications for a variance shall be made on the proper form, obtainable from the watershed administrator, and shall include the following information: 
a.  A site plan, drawn to a scale of at least one inch to 40 feet, indicating the property lines of the parcel upon which the use is proposed, any existing or proposed structures, parking areas and other built-upon areas, and surface water drainage. The site plan shall be neatly drawn and indicate the north point, the name and address of the person who prepared the plan, the date of the original drawing, and an accurate record of any later revisions. 
b.  A complete and detailed description of the proposed variance, together with any other pertinent information which the applicant feels would be helpful to the watershed review board in considering the application. 
The watershed administrator shall notify in writing each local government having jurisdiction in the watershed and any entity using the water supply for consumption. Such notice shall include a description of the variance being requested. Local governments receiving notice of the variance request may submit comments to the watershed administrator prior to a decision by the watershed review board. Such comments shall become a part of the record of proceedings of the watershed review board. 
(2)  Required findings for granting variance. Before the watershed review board may grant a variance, it shall make the following three findings, which shall be recorded in the permanent record of the case, and shall include the factual reasons on which they are based: 
a.  There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this chapter. In order to determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, the board must find that the five following conditions exist: 
1.  If he complies with the provisions of this chapter, the applicant can secure no reasonable return from, or can make no reasonable use of, his property. Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the board in granting a variance. Moreover, the board shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this chapter that will make possible the reasonable use of the property. 
2.  The hardship results from the application of this chapter to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship. 
3.  The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its size, shape or topography, which is different from that of neighboring property. 
4.  The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates this chapter, or who purchases the property after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and then comes to the board for relief. 
5.  The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather than the result of conditions that are widespread. If other properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction, then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others, and would not promote equal justice. 
b.  The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and preserves its spirit. 
c.  In the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare have been ensured and substantial justice has been done. The board shall not grant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any respect impair the public health, safety or general welfare. 
(3)  Conditions. In granting the variance, the board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this chapter. If a variance for the construction, alteration or use of property is granted, such construction, alteration or use shall be in accordance with the approved site plan. 
(4)  Rehearing after previous denial. The watershed review board shall refuse to hear an appeal or an application for a variance previously denied if it finds that there have been no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or application. 
(5)  Expiration. A variance issued in accordance with this section shall be considered a watershed protection permit and shall expire if a building permit or watershed occupancy permit for such use is not obtained by the applicant within six months from the date of the decision. 
(6)  Major variances. 
a.  If the application calls for the granting of a major variance, and if the watershed review board decides in favor of granting the variance, the board shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing with all deliberate speed. The preliminary record of the hearing shall include: 
1.  The variance application. 
2.  The evidence presented. 
3.  Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence, and rulings on them. 
4.  The proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be added to the permit. 
b.  The preliminary record shall be sent to the state environmental management commission for its review as follows: 
1.  If the commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a major variance and that the property owner can secure no reasonable return from or make no practical use of the property unless the proposed variance is granted, and that the variance, if granted, will not result in a serious threat to the water supply, then the commission shall approve the variance as proposed or approve the proposed variance with conditions and stipulations. The commission shall prepare a commission decision and send it to the watershed review board. If the commission approves the variance as proposed, the board shall prepare a final decision granting the proposed variance. If the commission approves the variance with conditions and stipulations, the board shall prepare a final decision including such conditions and stipulations, granting the proposed variance. 
2.  If the commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a major variance and that the property owner can secure a reasonable return from or make a practical use of the property without the variance, or that the variance, if granted, will result in a serious threat to the water supply, then the commission shall deny approval of the variance as proposed. The commission shall prepare a commission decision and send it to the watershed review board. The board shall prepare a final decision denying the variance as proposed. 
(c)  Subdivision approval. See article III of this chapter. 
(d)  Public health. See article V of this chapter. 
(e)  Development approval. The board shall have jurisdiction over approval of all development greater than the low density option.

Sec. 40-139. - Cluster development. 
    Clustering of development is allowed in all watershed areas under the following conditions: 
(1)  Minimum lot sizes are not applicable to single-family cluster development projects; however, the total number of lots shall not exceed the number of lots allowed for single-family detached developments in section 40-138. Built-upon area or stormwater control requirements of the project shall not exceed that allowed for the critical area or balance of the watershed, whichever applies. 
(2)  All built-upon area shall be designed and located to minimize stormwater runoff impact to the receiving waters and minimize concentrated stormwater flow. 
(3)  The remainder of the tract shall remain in a vegetated or natural state. Where the development has an incorporated property owners' association, the title of the open space area shall be conveyed to the association for management. Where a property association is not incorporated, a maintenance agreement shall be filed with the property deeds.

Unified Development Ordinance 1-1
1.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.1.1 TITLE.
This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the Unified Development Ordinance (hereinafter "the Ordinance"). This Ordinance may also be known and may be referred to as the UDO.
1.1.2 PURPOSE.
In accordance with NCGS 160A-383 and 153A-341, the County of Lee (refers collectively to Lee County, City of Sanford, and Town of Broadway) hereby enact this Ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizens. To that end, these regulations are intended to respond uniformly and consistently to development proposals. This Ordinance also attempts to provide flexibility in dealing with situations that may fall outside typical processes and requirements. The elements that make up the Ordinance are interrelated and cannot be taken in isolation; they must be taken within the context and intent of the entire Ordinance. Specifically, the purposes of this Ordinance are described in §§ 1.1.3 and 1.1.4, below.
1.1.3 ZONING REGULATIONS.
Zoning regulations are included in Articles 3 and 4 of this Ordinance. Pursuant to NCGS § 160A-383 and 153A-341, the power of zoning is exercised in order to implement the Comprehensive Plan, and:
 to lessen congestion in the streets;
 to secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers;
 to promote health and the general welfare;
 to provide adequate light and air;
 to prevent the overcrowding of land;
 to avoid undue concentration of population;
 to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements;
 to protect and/or to enhance the character of each zoning district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses;
 to conserve the value of buildings; and
 to encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the planning areas.
1.1.4 SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS.
Subdivision regulations are included in Article 6. Pursuant to NCGS §§ 160A-372 and 153A-331, the power of subdivision control is exercised in order to:
 implement the goals of the Comprehensive Plan;

Unified Development Ordinance 3-1
3.1 GENERAL PROCEDURES
3.1.1 APPLICATION PROCESS AND OFFICIAL FILING DATE.
The specific procedures followed in reviewing various Applications for Development Approval may vary. Generally, the procedures for all applications have four common elements: (1) submittal of a complete application, including required fee payment and appropriate information; (2) review of the submittal by appropriate staff and boards; (3) action to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application; and (4) issuance of a permit, based on complete and approved plans.
3.1.1.1 PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE.
The applicant should meet with the Department of Community Development to discuss the nature of the proposed application, application submittal requirements, the procedure for action, and the standards for evaluation of the application.
3.1.2 COMPLETENESS REVIEW
3.1.2.1 The Department of Community Development shall review any application required by this Article for completeness. No Application shall be deemed complete unless all of the information required by Appendix B is included, and all filing fees required by this Ordinance. Current application materials shall be made available in the Department of Community Development Offices. Such applications shall be filed in advance of any public hearing or public meeting required pursuant to this Article or statute.
3.1.3 LOCAL PLANNING BOARD.
3.1.3.1 Each local planning board shall hold regularly scheduled public hearings to receive and review public input on those items required by this Ordinance and the NCGS. On those items where it has review authority, the Board shall recommend to the appropriate Governing Body approve, approve with conditions, or deny applications. The Department of Community Development will submit the proposed item to the Governing Body for its consideration.
3.1.3.2 The Department of Community Development shall provide for minutes to be written and retained, shall record the evidence submitted within the allotted hearing time, and shall include a summary of the considerations and the action of the Board.
3.1.4 CITY COUNCIL, COUNTY COMMISSION, AND TOWN BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS.
3.1.4.1 The Governing Bodies of the City of Sanford, Town of Broadway, and Lee County shall hold regularly scheduled public hearings to act upon all items required by this Ordinance and the NCGS to be considered by them. The Governing Bodies shall decide whether or not to approve, approve with conditions (if applicable), or deny such applications.
3.1.4.2 The Clerk to the Board shall provide for minutes to be written and retained, shall record the evidence submitted within the allotted hearing time, and shall include a summary of the considerations and the action of the respective Governing Body.
3.1.5 PUBLIC HEARINGS AND DECISIONMAKING PROCEDURES.
3.1.5.1 SCOPE OF ACTION.
The reviewing body may take any action on the application that is consistent with the notice given, including approval of the application, conditional approval (if applicable), or denial. The reviewing body may allow minor amendments to the application which: (1) proposes fewer dwelling units, floor area or impervious surface than that requested on the original application; (2) reduces the impact of the development; or (3) reduces the amount of land involved from that indicated in the notices of the hearing. The reviewing body shall not, in any case, permit: a greater amount of development, a use falling in a different general use category, a larger land area than indicated in the original application, or a greater variance than was indicated in the notice. In addition, the
Article 3
Unified Development Ordinance 3-2
reviewing body shall not reduce or eliminate conditions for a Conditional Use District unless a new notice is provided prior to the meeting at which a final decision is to be made.
3.1.5.2 LEGISLATIVE AND ADVISORY PUBLIC HEARINGS PROCEDURES.
3.1.5.2.1 Purpose. The purpose of a legislative or advisory review public hearing is to provide the public an opportunity to be heard. Unlike quasi-judicial hearings, a legislative proceeding does not require procedural due process protections, such as right of the parties to offer evidence, sworn testimony, or findings of fact. Like quasi-judicial hearings, legislative hearings are public hearings preceded by notice to interested parties. Public hearings are required for legislative review hearings, such as amendments to the Comprehensive Plan, amendments to this Ordinance (including Zoning provisions of this Ordinance and the Zoning Map), and applications for a Planned Unit Development.
3.1.5.2.2 Conduct of Hearing. Testimony may be presented by any member of the public, but need not be submitted under oath or affirmation. The decision-making body may establish a time limit for testimony.
3.1.5.2.3 Record of Proceedings. The body conducting the hearing shall record the minutes of the proceedings by any appropriate means as prescribed by rule and consistent with NCGS Chapter 132. The Department of Community Development will provide the record upon request by application and payment of a fee set by the County of Lee (to cover duplication costs.)
3.1.5.2.4 Notice Provisions. The notice requirements for legislative and advisory proceedings, including amendments to this Ordinance, or the Official Zoning Map, shall be that as provided in NCGS §§ 153A-323, 153A-343, 160A-364, and 160A-384. More specifically, a notice of the hearing shall be published once a week for two successive calendar weeks. The notice shall be published the first time not less than 10 days nor more than 25 days before the date fixed for the hearing. In computing such period, the day of publication is not to be included but the day of the hearing shall be included.
3.1.5.3 QUASI-JUDICIAL PUBLIC HEARING PROCEDURES.
3.1.5.3.1 Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to any application for a special use permit, variance, appeal, or any other quasi-judicial action. The board deciding such action(s) shall determine contested facts and make its decision within a reasonable time. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent, material, and substantial evidence in the record. Each quasi-judicial decision shall be reduced to writing and reflect the board's determination of contested facts and their application to the applicable standards. The written decision shall be signed by the chair or other duly authorized member of the board of adjustment. A quasi-judicial decision is effective upon filing the written decision with the clerk to the board or such other office or official as the ordinance specifies. The decision of the board shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail to the applicant, property owner, and to any person who has submitted a written request for a copy, prior to the date the decision becomes effective. The person required to provide notice shall certify that proper notice has been made. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be subject to review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari pursuant to G.S. 160A-393. A petition for review shall be filed with the clerk of superior court by the later of 30 days after the decision is effective or after a written copy thereof is given in accordance of this subsection. When first-class mail is used to deliver notice, three days shall be added to the time to file the petition.
Article 3
Unified Development Ordinance 3-3
3.1.5.3.2 Rulemaking Authority. The Planning Commission and the County of Lee may adopt general rules which apply to quasi-judicial public hearings. These public hearings may relate to a Special Use permit or to a proceeding before the Board of Adjustment.
3.1.5.3.3 Conduct of Hearing. Any person or persons may appear at a public hearing and submit evidence, either individually or as a representative. Each person who appears at a public hearing shall state, for the record, his or her name, address, and if appearing on behalf of an organization or group, its name and mailing address. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in NCGS §§ 153A-345 and 160A-388.
3.1.5.3.4 Notice Provisions. Notice of hearings conducted pursuant to this section shall be mailed to the person or entity whose appeal, application, or request is the subject of the hearing; to the owner of the property that is the subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing; to the owners of all parcels of land abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing; and to any other persons entitled to receive notice as provided by the zoning or unified development ordinance. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the city may rely on the county tax listing to determine owners of property entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least 10 days, but not more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within that same time period, the city shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing on the site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street or highway right-of-way.
3.1.5.4 ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS.
3.1.5.4.1 Administrative decisions are routine, non-discretionary zoning ordinance implementation matters carried out by the staff, including issuance of permits for permitted uses. In general, the Department of Community Development is a purely administrative agent following the literal provisions of this Ordinance. The Department of Community Development may engage in some fact finding, (for example, as in making an initial determination as to whether a nonconforming use was in existence at the time a zoning provision was adopted). This involves determining objective facts that do not involve an element of discretion. In contrast to quasi-judicial hearings, administrative decisions are made without a hearing at all, with the staff member reviewing an application to determine if it is complete and compliant with objective standards set forth in this Ordinance. Lancaster County v. Mecklenburg County, 334 N.C. 496, 434 S.E.2d 604 (1993).
3.1.5.4.2 The procedures for processing administrative permits, such as Zoning Clearance Permit, are set forth in the sections of this Ordinance pertaining to such permits.
3.1.5.4.3 No notice shall be required for an administrative permit issued pursuant to §3.2 of this Ordinance unless otherwise provided by this Ordinance or by law.
Article 3
Unified Development Ordinance 3-4
3.2 ADMINISTRATIVE PERMITS
3.2.1 PURPOSE.
The purpose of this Section is to prescribe procedures for permits which do not require quasi-judicial or legislative notice or a public hearing. A public hearing is not required for permits set forth in this Section for one or more of the following reasons:
3.2.1.1 If required, public hearings have already been conducted relating to the permit application. The permit application procedure was designed to ensure that the proposed use complies with a previously approved subdivision plat, site plan, specific plan, comprehensive plan amendment, or conditional rezoning (e.g., zoning clearing, certificate of occupancy).
3.2.1.2 The proposed use is permitted by right in the applicable zoning district (e.g., zoning clearance, certificate of occupancy).
3.2.1.3 The permit is subject to unique provisions of state or federal law which restrict the County of Lees discretion and which require expedited review.
3.2.2 APPLICABILITY.
3.2.2.1 The provisions of this Section shall apply subsequent to approval of any site plan or final site plan as set forth in § 3.6 of this Ordinance. Administrative permits include:
 a Zoning Clearance Permit (§ 3.2.3, below)
 a building permit (§ 3.2.4, below)
 a sedimentation and pollution control permit (§ 3.2.5, below)
 a sign permit (§ 3.2.6 , below)
 temporary use permit (§ 3.2.7, below)
3.2.2.2 All development permits applicable to a proposed development must be issued in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, prior to any development activity. Permits are required for all development, unless otherwise excepted, to ensure compliance with the various adopted codes, standards, and laws and to ensure consistency with the
Comprehensive Plan and policies of the County of Lee.
3.2.3 ZONING CLEARANCE PERMIT.
3.2.3.1 APPLICATION.
Upon adoption of this Ordinance, buildings or structures shall be erected or constructed, and uses shall be established, only on parcels of land that have been created in conformance with this Ordinance. To construct any structure, use any land, or change the use* of any structure or land, a zoning clearance permit must be obtained from the Department of Community Development and a building permit obtained from the appropriate Building Inspections Department. (*Note: A change of use shall require a zoning clearance permit only when the change of use would otherwise require a building permit.)
3.2.3.2 RESTRICTION ON SINGLE-FAMILY DETACHED DWELLING LOTS.
In any zoning district which permits single-family detached dwellings, no Zoning Clearance Permit shall be issued for a use or dwelling on the same lot as an existing detached single-family dwelling except as provided for in this Ordinance.
3.2.3.3 ADDITIONS TO EXISTING STRUCTURES.
3.2.3.3.1 The provisions of this section apply to any expansion or addition to an existing conforming structure or building. This Ordinance classifies additions or expansions of existing structures into three categories for the purposes of identifying what design standards shall apply. Expansion of nonconforming structures is regulated in Article 13 of this Ordinance.
(a) Low Impact Additions/Expansions shall be defined as an addition that equates to less than 25% to the total Gross Floor Area (GFA) of a site and requires less than 10 additional off-street parking spaces. Low Impact (Type 1) expansions shall be exempt from most UDO design improvements, except :
Article 3

 all outdoor solid waste dispoal areas shall be screened in accordance with Section 10.1 of the UDO
(b) Moderate Additions/Expansions shall be defined as:
 a proposed addition that is greater than 25% but less than 50% total of the total GFA of a site, and/or
 a proposed addition that requires 10 or more additional off-street parking spaces.
Moderate Additions/Expansion shall provide the following site improvements from this Ordinance:
 Street Yard buffer as set forth in Section 7.7 of this Ordinance. The Street Yard buffer shall not be required where existing buildings encroach into the area that would be required to provide such a buffer. This exemption does not include existing parking areas.
 Parking area landscaping as set forth in Section 7.6 of this Ordinance.
 If abutting single-family residential developed properties, a Buffer (screening) Yard as set forth in Section 7.5 of this Ordinance.
 Conformity to the standards for Article in terms of off-street parking and driveway design.
 new or expanded off-street parking areas shall be paved in accordance with Section 8.2.6.1
 if fronting on a corridor as defined in Section 10.7 of the UDO, the building(s) shall be retrofitted to conform to all design standards of that section all outdoor solid waste disposal areas shall be screened in accordance with Section 10.1 of the UDO
(c) Substantial Additions/Expansions shall be defined as proposed additions that equate to 50% or more of total GFA of a site. Construction of a Substantial Addition/Expansion shall require compliance with the full design and dimensional requirements of the UDO.
3.2.3.3.2 Required improvements for additions or expansion to existing structures as identified in this § 3.2.3.2 shall be applied to the portion of a development site where the addition is being constructed. The area to be included for improvements shall be determined by the Administrator.
3.2.3.3.3 In situations where compliance with Section 3.2.3.3.1 of this Ordinance could only be achieved through the removal of an existing building space, the Administrator shall have the authority to reduce or eliminate these requirements where (and only where) such requirements are in conflict with an existing building(s).
3.2.3.4 CHANGES OF USE
3.2.3.4.1 A Change of Use shall require a Zoning Compliance Permit only when the change of use would otherwise require a building permit. A Change of Use shall be further defined as a change from one principal use of a building or land to another principal use of the building or land whether or not there is an increase in the size of the existing building or extent of the use of land. Furthermore, for the purposes of zoning, a change of use shall be determined based on the more broad land use groupings of Table 4.6-1 of this UDO (i.e. Institutional and Civic vs. Retail Trade). If it is determined that no change of use has occurred, no design standards of this UDO shall be required.
3.2.3.4.2 If it is determined that a change of use has occurred, the Administrator must then determine what design standards should apply.
(a) Minor Change of Use. This group includes the following:
 a change of use has occurred, but no additional parking is required
 a change of use has occurred and additional parking is required but is less than 10 total spaces

Article 3
Unified Development Ordinance 3-11
3.4 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
3.4.1 PURPOSE.
3.4.1.1. Conditional Zoning Districts are zoning districts in which the development and use of the property is subject to predetermined standards and rules, regulations, or other conditions imposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to the particular property. A conditional zoning district allows particular uses to be established only in accordance with specific standards and conditions pertaining to each individual development project. Some land uses are of such a nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediate surrounding area and on the entire community, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards. There are also circumstances in which a general district designation allowing such a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of these regulations, the adopted comprehensive plan, and adopted district and area plans.
3.4.1.2 There are two types of Conditional Zoning Districts available:
 ·Conditional Zoning District Type 1
 Conditional Zoning District Type 2
3.4.2 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICT TYPE 1.
3.4.2.1 The Conditional Zoning District Type 1 is defined as a conditional zoning district created as a stand-alone district with its own unique conditions. Under a Conditional Zoning District Type 1, an owner would have the freedom to develop his/her own unique list of permitted uses and design standards. It is also understood that such a district would need to be designed so as to maintain the integrity and characteristics of the surrounding community as well as conform to the spirit and intent of the Zoning Ordinance. A Conditional Zoning District Type 1 would be most suitable in situations where none of the current conventional Zoning Districts accommodate the desired use(s), such as a large mixed-use planned development in which the owner/developer has a clear vision as to how the property is to be developed.
3.4.2.2 Only the property owner(s) of a proposed Conditional Zoning District Type 1 shall be eligible to apply for rezoning to a Conditional Zoning District.
3.4.2.3 The owner shall specify the use(s) of the property and shall propose additional conditions to ensure compatibility between the development and the surrounding neighborhood. The conditions shall include all of the following (as applicable):
 The location on the property of the proposed use(s);
 The number of dwelling units;
 The location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways, and access streets;
 The location and extent of buffer areas and other special purpose areas;
 The timing of development;
 The location and extent of rights-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public purposes;
 And any other such conditions the applicant may wish to propose.
The application shall include a Site Plan and detailed narrative text that specifies the conditions that will govern the development and use of the property,
3.4.2.4 It is required that applicants consult with the Community Development staff prior to submission of an application for a Conditional Zoning District. The Community Development staff can assist the applicant in determining preliminary assessments regarding the appropriateness of the proposed conditions with respect to existing zoning and surrounding land use.
3.4.2.5 Applications for Conditional Zoning Districts shall be submitted and reviewed in the same procedural manner as set forth in Sections 3.3.2 through 3.3.4 of this Ordinance.
Article 3
Unified Development Ordinance 3-12
3.4.3 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICT TYPE 2.
3.4.3.1 The Conditional Zoning District Type 2 is defined as a conditional zoning district created for the purpose of allowing a property owner to place additional conditions upon an existing, equivalent conventional, general use zoning district. Conditional Zoning District Type 2 would be the preferred zoning approach if a petitioner desired to (a) to reduce or narrow the number of permitted uses and/or (b) impose higher level design standards than that which exists within an equivalent general use zoning district. Conditional Zoning District Type 2 would also be practical in situations where a petitioner desires to install or construct additional buffers or other physical features that would serve to increase the protection afforded neighboring properties and/or the appearance of the proposed development.
3.4.3.2 Only the property owner(s) of a proposed Conditional Zoning District Type 2 shall be eligible to apply for rezoning to a Conditional Zoning District. The owner shall specify the use(s) of the property and shall propose additional conditions to ensure compatibility between the development and the surrounding neighborhood. The conditions shall include all of the following (as applicable):
 The location on the property of the proposed use(s);
 The number of dwelling units;
 The location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways, and access streets;
 The location and extent of buffer areas and other special purpose areas;
 The timing of development;
 The location and extent of rights-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public purposes;
 And any other such conditions the applicant may wish to propose.
3.4.3.3. The application shall include a site plan and detailed narrative text that specifies the conditions that will govern the development and use of the property.
3.4.3.4 It is required that applicants consult with the Community Development staff prior to submission of an application for a Conditional Zoning District. The Community Development staff can assist the applicant in determining preliminary assessments regarding the appropriateness of the proposed conditions with respect to existing zoning and surrounding land use.
3.4.3.5 Applications for Conditional Zoning Districts shall be submitted and reviewed in the same procedural manner as set forth in Sections 3.3.2 through 3.3.4 of this Ordinance.
3.4.4 SCOPE OF APPROVAL.
3.4.4.1 Any conditions in association with a Conditional Zoning District and so authorized shall be perpetually binding upon the property included in such Conditional Zoning District unless subsequently changed or amended as provided for in this Article.
3.4.4.2 The applicant shall obtain certification of the approval of the Conditional Use District, and shall record the legal description and accompanying map exhibit/site plan in the office of the register of deeds of Lee County.
3.4.4.3 If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or invalid, or if the applicant should fail to accept any of the conditions of approval, the Conditional Zoning District shall be deemed null and void and the governing body shall initiate proceedings to rezone the property to its previous zoning classification. Continued or repeated violation of the conditions in an approved Conditional Zoning District shall constitute an applicants failure to accept said conditions.
3.4.4.4 Any violation of a condition in an approved Conditional Zoning District shall be treated the same as any other violation of this Ordinance and shall be subject to the same remedies and penalties as any such violation.
3.4.4.5 The approval of a zoning map or text amendment does not authorize any development activity. Application for a Zoning Clearance Permit and any other administrative permits required by § 3.2 of this Ordinance shall be required.
Article 3
Unified Development Ordinance 3-13
3.4.5 RE-APPLICATION FOR A DENIED AMENDMENT.
Reapplication after denial of an application for a Conditional Zoning District shall be treated in the same manner as set forth in Section 3.3.7 of this Ordinance.
Article 3
Unified Development Ordinance 3-14
3.5 SPECIAL USE PERMITS
3.5.1 APPLICABILITY.
3.5.1.1 The purpose of this Section is to establish procedures and standards for the processing and approval of Special Use Permits. Special Use permits provide a form of discretionary approval for certain uses which are generally compatible with the land uses permitted by right in a zoning district, but which require individual review of their location, design, and configuration. Special Uses ensure the appropriateness of the use at a particular location within a given zoning district.
3.5.1.2 Only those uses that are enumerated as Special Uses in a zoning district, as set forth in the Use Matrix (§ 4.6, Table 4.6-1 of this Ordinance), shall be authorized by the Board of Adjustment.
3.5.2 APPROVAL PROCEDURE
3.5.2.1. No special use permit shall be authorized, developed, or otherwise carried out until the applicant has secured approval of the special use by the Board of Adjustment and approval of a final site plan by the Administrator.
3.5.2.2. Applications for special use permit approvals shall be filed with the Administrator. Pre-application meetings with the Administrator prior to filing are required.
3.5.2.3. Major site plan applications (see Appendix B) shall be filed concurrently with special use permit applications. The information shall be provided to the Board of Adjustment during their deliberations.
3.5.2.4. The Board of Adjustment shall conduct a quasi-judicial hearing in accordance with the requirements of § 3.1.7 of this Ordinance. The Board of Adjustment shall deny the request, approve the request; or approve the request with conditions.
3.5.2.5. The Board of Adjustment may place conditions on the use as part of the approval to assure that adequate mitigation measures are associated with the use. The conditions shall become a part of the special use permit approval and shall be included in the final site plan application.
3.5.2.6. Violations of any of the conditions shall be treated in the manner as set forth in § 1.6 of this Ordinance.
3.5.2.7. An application for a special use permit that has been denied may be resubmitted only if there has been a substantial change in circumstances, as determined by the Administrator, or if substantial revisions have been made to the application for development approval (see § 3.5.6 for further restrictions on reapplication).
3.5.2.8. Minor field alterations or minor revisions to approved special uses may be approved by the Administrator if the special use still meets the intent of the standards established with the original approval. Minor alteration/revisions shall be limited to changes that do not increase the intensity, density, or character of the use. If the Administrator determines that the change is not minor, the Applicant shall apply for a revised Special Use Permit. The applicant may appeal the decision of the Administrator to the Board of Adjustment.
3.5.3 APPROVAL CRITERIA.
Uses permitted subject to Special Use review shall be permitted only if the applicant demonstrates to the Board of Adjustment that:
3.5.3.1 The use will not materially endanger the public health or safety if located where proposed and developed according to the plan as submitted and approved,
3.5.3.2 The use meets all required conditions and specifications,
3.5.3.3 The use will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property, or that the use is a public necessity, and

Article 3
Unified Development Ordinance 3-15
in which it is located and in general conformity with all adopted land use plans.
3.5.3.5 The Board may impose additional conditions upon granting the Special Use Permit so long as said conditions are reasonable and appropriate.
3.5.4 ADDITIONAL STUDIES FOR CERTAIN LAND USES.
3.5.4.1 Upon determining that the proposed use will have particular impacts potentially inconsistent with any of the above approval criteria, the County may retain the services of a consultant mutually acceptable to it and the applicant to conduct a study of such impacts as related to the above criteria. The applicant shall pay a fee as part of the special use permit application for the cost of the consulting services incurred by the County, and the report of the study results shall be submitted to and approved by the County prior to issuance of the special use permit.
3.5.4.2 This section 3.5.4 shall apply only to those land uses requiring a Special Use Permit and as listed within the Industrial and Manufacturing or Transportation, Communications and Utilities land use subcategories as found in the Permitted Use Matrix (§ 4.6, Table 4.6-1 of this Ordinance).
3.5.5 VOTING.
A majority of the members of the Board of Adjustment shall be required to decide on whether or not to grant a Special Use Permit. For the purposes of this subsection, vacant positions on the board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not be considered members of the board for calculation of the requisite majority if there are no qualified alternates available to take the place of such members.
3.5.6 SCOPE OF APPROVAL.
3.5.6.1 The approval of a Special Use permit shall authorize the applicant to apply for final site plan approval pursuant to § 3.6 of this Ordinance. All approvals of Special Use permits require approval of the site plan. Any Special Use permit approval shall become null and void if a required site plan is not approved within 24 months after the date of the approval. No Zoning Clearance Permit may be issued until the final major site plan and Special Use permits are approved. Approval of a Special Use permit does not authorize any development activity.
3.5.6.2 Minor field alterations or minor revisions to approved Special Uses may be approved by the Department of Community Development if the Special Use still meets the intent of the standards established with the original approval.

3.7 VARIANCES
3.7.1 PURPOSE.
The purpose of this Section is to protect the rights of applicants, landowners, and affected persons by providing procedures for variances from the provisions of this UDO. This Section implements the provisions of NCGS §§ 160A-388 and 153A-345.
3.7.2 APPLICABLITY.
This Section applies to any an application for a variance as prescribed in NCGS §§ 160A-388(d) in incorporated areas and the ETJ and § 153A-345(d) in unincorporated areas outside of the ETJ.
3.7.3 DECISION.
3.7.3.1 The application shall be considered by the appropriate Board of Adjustment following receipt of a complete application and appropriate notification of meeting. The Board of Adjustment shall conduct a hearing on the appeal pursuant to the procedures established in NCGS §§ 153A-345 and 160A-388 and § 3.1.7.2 of this Ordinance.
3.7.3.2 Appeals from the decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be filed with the Clerk of Lee County within 30 days of the final decision of the Board. The Board of Adjustments decision shall be considered a final decision upon filing of the Boards Order in the Clerk to the Boards office.

3.7.4.1 When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of a zoning ordinance, the board of adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the ordinance upon a showing of all of the following:
(a) Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
(b) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.
(c) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.
(d) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.
3.7.4.2. No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance. Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance. Any other ordinance that regulates land use or development may provide for variances consistent with the provisions of this subsection.
3.7.4.3 Voting. The concurring vote of four-fifths of the board shall be necessary to grant a variance. For the purposes of this subsection, vacant positions on the board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not be considered members of the board for calculation of the requisite supermajority if there are no qualified alternates available to take the place of such members.
3.7.5 APPLICATION FOR VARIANCE.
A variance is not a right. It may be granted to an applicant only if the applicant establishes compliance with the criteria established in NCGS §§ 153A-345(d) and 160A-388(d).
Article 3
Unified Development Ordinance 3-19
3.8 APPEALS
3.8.1 PURPOSE.
The purpose of this Section is to protect the rights of applicants, landowners, and affected persons by providing procedures to hear and decide appeals from decisions of administrative officials charged with enforcement of the unified development ordinance and may hear appeals arising out of any other ordinance that regulates land use or development. This Section implements the provisions of NCGS §§ 160A-388 and 153A-345.
3.8.2 APPLICABLITY.
This Section applies to any of the following:
(1) appeals from and review any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official charged with enforcing this Ordinance, as prescribed in NCGS §§ 160A-388(b) in incorporated areas and the ETJ and § 153A-345(b) in unincorporated areas outside of the ETJ.
3.8.3 PROCEDURES
3.8.3.1 The board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals decisions of administrative officials charged with enforcement of the zoning or unified development ordinance and may hear appeals arising out of any other ordinance that regulates land use or development, pursuant to all of the following:
a) Any person who has standing under G.S. 160A-393(d) or the city may appeal a decision to the board of adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for the appeal.
b) The official who made the decision shall give written notice to the owner of the property that is the subject of the decision and to the party who sought the decision, if different from the owner. The written notice shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail.
c) The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the written notice within which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt from any source of actual or constructive notice of the decision within which to file an appeal.
d) It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to appeal have constructive notice of the decision from the date a sign containing the words "Zoning Decision" or "Subdivision Decision" in letters at least six inches high and identifying the means to contact an official for information about the decision is prominently posted on the property that is the subject of the decision, provided the sign remains on the property for at least 10 days. Posting of signs is not the only form of constructive notice. Any such posting shall be the responsibility of the landowner or applicant. Verification of the posting shall be provided to the official who made the decision.
e) The official who made the decision shall transmit to the board all documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.
f) An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement of the action appealed from unless the official who made the decision certifies to the board of adjustment after notice of appeal has been filed that because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the ordinance. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the board of adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the ordinance shall not stay the further review of an application for permits or permissions to use such property; in
Article 3
Unified Development Ordinance 3-20
these situations the appellant may request and the board may grant a stay of a final decision of permit applications or building permits affected by the issue being appealed.
g) Subject to the provisions of subsection (f) of this subsection, the board of adjustment shall hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time. A majority of the members shall be required to decide an appeal from a decision of the Administrator or any other quasi-judicial matter (except a Variance) or to determine an appeal made in the nature of certiorari. For the purposes of this subsection, vacant positions on the board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not be considered members of the board for calculation of the requisite majority if there are no qualified alternates available to take the place of such members.
h) The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in the notice of appeal. If any party or the city would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the board shall continue the hearing. The board of adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to be made. The board shall have all the powers of the official who made the decision.
i) When hearing an appeal pursuant to G.S. 160A-400.9(e) or any other appeal in the nature of certiorari, the hearing shall be based on the record below and the scope of review shall be as provided in G.S. 160A-393(k).
j) The parties to an appeal that has been made under this subsection may agree to mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution. The ordinance may set standards and procedures to facilitate and manage such voluntary alternative dispute resolution.

4.4.1. The boundaries of zoning districts established by this Ordinance shall be designated on a map or maps entitled Official Zoning Map(s) of the County of Lee. These maps and all references and dates shown thereon shall be certified by the Chairman of the Lee County Commissioners, the Mayor of the City of Sanford, and the Mayor of the Town of Broadway. The Official Zoning Map is hereby incorporated by reference as set forth in its entirety herein, and may be referred to as Article 4, § 4.4 of the UDO.
4.4.2. The Official Zoning Map shall be located in the Department of Community Development. A copy of the Official Zoning Map shall be kept on file with the Clerk of the City of Sanford, Town of Broadway, and Lee County. Changes thereto shall be clearly shown on the Official Zoning Map when officially adopted by the City of Sanford, Town of Broadway, and/or Lee County.
4.4.3. The Official Zoning Map shall bear a stamp showing the effective date of this Ordinance and shall:
 Be certified by the Department of Community Development
 Be identified by the signatures of the County Commission Chairman and the Mayors
 Be attested by the County of Lee Clerk
 Bear the seal of the County of Lee under the words: Official Zoning Map, Sanford/Lee County/ Broadway.
4.4.4. If a zoning district is eliminated and there is no corresponding zoning district classification on the Official Zoning Map, the property shall remain subject to all restrictions, regulations and conditions imposed under the zoning ordinance in effect at the time that the Official Zoning Map previously in effect was effective unless and until the zoning classification of the property is amended pursuant to this Ordinance.
4.4.5. If a property is zoned as a conditional zoning district at the time of adoption of this ordinance, it shall remain subject to all terms, conditions, and restrictions of approval under the zoning ordinance in effect prior to the adoption of this Ordinance.
Article 4
Unified Development Ordinance 4-15
4.5. ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
4.5.1 Unless otherwise provided, zoning district boundaries shall be located on municipal corporate lines, section lines, parcel lines, natural boundary lines or on the center lines of highways, streets, alleys, or railroad rights-of-way. In cases where these lines are not used, the zoning district lines shall be as determined by using the scale of the Official Zoning Map. If a parcel of land is divided by a zoning district boundary line at the time of enactment of this Ordinance or by subsequent amendments thereto, the appropriate standards and uses for each zone shall apply on the portion of the parcel covered by that zone.
4.5.2 Any dispute as to the boundary or location of property within a zoning district shall be resolved in accordance with the following criteria. When a district boundary is shown as approximately following a street, highway, alley, road, right-of-way, parkway, public utility right-of-way, railroad, stream or watercourse, the boundary shall be deemed to be the centerline of such feature.
 Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines.
 Boundaries indicated as approximately following established municipal limits and county borders shall be construed as following such lines.
 Boundaries indicated as separated from but approximately parallel to any of the features indicated above, or any land marked or monumental line, shall be deemed to be parallel to the aforesaid centerline or railroad track mid-point.
 Distances not specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the scale of the map.
 Where a street, highway, railroad or other physical monument or marker on the ground, by which a boundary is determined, varies from that as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the physical monument or marker located on the ground shall control. Where physical or cultural features, such as flood plains, vary from those shown on the Official Zoning Map,
or in other circumstances not covered above, the Department of Community Development shall determine the district boundaries.
Article 4
Unified Development Ordinance 4-16
4.6. USE REGULATIONS
4.6.1 GENERALLY.
No use shall be permitted pursuant to this Ordinance, and no Development Permit authorizing a use may be authorized, issued, or approved by any officer, official, or agency, unless said use is listed as a permitted or Special Use in this § 4.6 and all applicable permits and approvals have been issued by the agency or official with final decision-making authority. Those uses permitted as Primary Uses or Buildings within each zoning district shall be those uses listed in the Use Matrix (Table 4.6-1) and as forth in § 4.6, below.
4.6.2 PRIMARY USES.
No Zoning Clearance Permit shall be issued for a Primary use not specifically mentioned or described by category in the Use Matrix (Table 4.6-1). Notwithstanding any provision of this Section to the contrary, uses which are preempted by state statute are not listed in the Use Matrix, and may be permitted in accordance with state law.
4.6.2.1 INTERPRETATION OF USE MATRIX.
The use categories listed in the first column of Table 4.6-1 are defined in this Ordinance, the LBCS or in other resources cross-referenced in this Ordinance. In determining whether a use is permitted by right, permitted as a Special Use, or prohibited within each zoning district, the following rules of construction apply:
4.6.2.2. PUD AND TND EXCLUDED.
Uses in the PUD and TND Districts shall be governed by their respective Sections in this Ordinance and shall not be subject to Table 4.6-1.
P
Permitted Uses. The letter P indicates that the listed use is permitted by right within the zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all other applicable standards of this Ordinance.
D
Permitted Uses with Development Regulations. The letter D indicates that the use is also subject to development regulations as prescribed in Article 5. The use may be permitted as of right or as a Special Use, but will also be subject to the requirements of Article 5 Supplemental Development Regulations.
S
Special Uses. The letter S indicates that the listed use is permitted within the respective zoning district only after review and approval of a Special Use Permit, in accordance with the review procedures of § 3.5 of this Ordinance. Special Uses are subject to all other applicable standards of this Ordinance and those requirements that may reasonably be imposed by the County of Lee consistent with the criteria set forth in § 3.5 of this Ordinance and any Development Regulations which apply to said use.
-
Prohibited Uses. A dash () indicates that the listed use type is not allowed within the respective zoning district, unless it is otherwise expressly allowed by other regulations of this Ordinance.
Article 4
Unified Development Ordinance 4-17
4.6.3 ACCESSORY AND TEMPORARY USES.
Permitted Accessory Uses and permitted Temporary Uses are set forth in Article 5 of this Ordinance. If a Primary use is listed as prohibited in a Zoning District, but is permitted as an Accessory Use in § 5.1 of this Ordinance, the use is permitted only as an Accessory Use to a Principal Use or Principal Building on the same lot, tract or parcel. Such uses cannot be established unless and until there is a Principal Use or Principal Building on the same lot, tract or parcel to which that use is accessory.
4.6.5 USES NOT LISTED.
4.6.5.1 The Department of Community Development shall make a determination if a use not mentioned could reasonably be interpreted to fit into a use category where similar uses are described. It is the intent of this Article to group similar or compatible land uses into specific zoning districts, either as permitted uses or as uses authorized by a Special Use permit. In the event that a particular use is not listed in the Use Matrix, and such use is not listed as a prohibited use and is not otherwise prohibited by law, the Department of Community Development shall determine whether a materially similar use exists in this Section.
4.6.5.2 Should the Department of Community Development determine that a materially similar use does exist, the regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not listed and the Department of Community Developments decision shall be recorded in writing. The Department of Community Development may determine that a use is materially similar if the use is listed as within the same Structure or Function classification as the use specifically enumerated in the Use Matrix, as determined by the Land- Based Classification Standards (LBCS) of the American Planning Association. The use shall be considered materially similar if it falls within the same LBCS classification.
4.6.6 INTERPRETATON OF LAND BASED CLASSIFICATION STANDARDS (LBCS).
In order to assist in interpretation of the Use Matrix, the LBCS numbers precede each use in the Use Matrix. In interpreting the Use Matrix, the following rules of construction shall apply:
 If a use is listed for a specific classification, while a more general classification within the same industry classification is also listed for another use, the specific classification governs. The specific use is not permitted in all districts where the uses coded to the general classification are permitted simply because they share a similar code number. The numbers increase as the classifications get more specific.
 Some uses are listed separately, but fall within the same LBCS classification. The uses within one such classification are not permitted in all of the zoning districts as the others simply because they fall within the same LBCS classification.
Example: Restaurant, with incidental consumption of alcoholic beverages is coded as LBCS Structure 2220. A Restaurant, no consumption of alcoholic beverages permitted is also coded as Structure 2220. The former is listed as a prohibited use in District X. It is not considered a permitted use in X simply because it falls within the same LBCS classification as the latter use.

Article 4
Unified Development Ordinance 4-28
4.7 DIMENSIONAL AND DENSITY REGULATION
4.7.1 PURPOSE.
This Section establishes minimum and maximum standards for the height, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures, the percentage of lots that may be occupied, the size of yards, courts and other open spaces, the density of population, and the location and use of buildings pursuant to NCGS §§153A-340 and 160A-381(a).
Developments in the PUD, TND, and TOD districts shall be governed by their respective Sections in this Ordinance and shall not be subject to the dimensional and density regulations of this § 4.7 or Table 4.7-1.
4.7.2 DENSITY REGULATIONS.
4.7.2.1 SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DENSITY.
For Conventional Subdivisions, the ordinance does not establish a maximum or minimum number of total permitted dwelling units, because the total number of dwelling units is governed by minimum lot size. Cluster Subdivisions shall not be subject to minimum lot size, but total permitted dwelling units shall not exceed the amount established as set forth in Table 4.7-1.
4.7.2.2 NON-RESIDENTIAL AND MULTI-FAMILY DENSITY.
Impervious surface ratio is the measurement tool used to regulate density for non-residential zoning districts. Impervious surfaces include all buildings or structures measured at their greatest extent and so as to include areas overhung by eaves, balconies, and other projecting features of the structure; also all paved or otherwise hard-surfaced areas such as buildings, pavement, gravel areas (e.g. roads, parking lots, paths), recreation facilities (e.g. tennis courts), and similar hard-surfaced areas. Impervious surface ratio is a measure of the amount of impervious area that covers a parcel or tract. As an example, a maximum impervious surface ratio of 0.7 indicates that a maximum of 70% of the land area may be covered with an impervious surface.
Table 4.7-1 establishes a maximum impervious surface ratio for each of the non-residential zoning districts.
4.7.3 DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS.
4.7.3.1 SETBACKS.
Setbacks for buildings or structures are measured as the area between the furthest projection of a principal structure and the lot line on which the structure is located, except as modified by the standards of this Section. Setbacks shall be unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as specified in this Section. Building setbacks for each zoning district are set forth in Table 4.7-1.
The following features may encroach into a required building setback:
 Bay windows or other structural overhang, not to exceed three (3) feet;
 Chimneys, not to exceed two (2) feet;
 Heating and cooling units, not to exceed (3) feet;
 Overhanging roof, eave, gutter, cornice, or other architectural feature and awnings, not to exceed 2 feet;
 Steps, stairs or fire escapes (non-enclosed), not to exceed 6 feet;
 Any accessory building or use customarily incidental to the permitted primary use or building as allowed in accordance with § 5.1, Accessory Uses and Structures.
4.7.3.2 SETBACKS FOR LOTS WITH MORE THAN ONE STREET FRONTAGE.
Structures shall meet the front yard setback from all abutting street rights-of-way unless otherwise provided in this Ordinance. For undeveloped multiple frontage lots, the developer has the option to determine which yard shall be considered the front so long as the structure to be constructed on said lot shall have its front facing the same yard. For the purposes of applying setbacks to an existing developed lot, the front yard setback shall be defined as the yard with the shortest amount of street frontage. All other frontages shall be
Article 4
Unified Development Ordinance 4-29
considered street side yards and the rear yard shall be that yard that is opposite the designated front yard. For the purposes of determining setback distance, a street side yard shall be considered the same as a front yard and shall meet the respective front yard setback.
4.7.3.3. PROVISIONS FOR REDUCED FRONT YARD SETBACK IN DEVELOPED AREAS.
(a) The minimum or maximum front setback may be reduced for any lot where the average established front setback on developed lots located within 300 feet on each side of such lot, and fronting on the same street as such lot, is less or more than the minimum or maximum required setback. In such cases, the minimum or maximum front setback on such a lot may be less or more than the required front setback, but not vary by more than five (5) feet from the average of the existing front setbacks on the developed lots within 300 feet of each side.
(b) Where the applicant requests an adjustment in the front setback, the average setbacks shall be provided by the applicant based upon public records or actual measurements. Where the Administrator requires an adjustment in the maximum front setback, such information shall be provided by the Department of Community Development. The Department of Community Development is also authorized, but not required, to provide data pertaining to the average setback for designated areas of the County for purposes of this section.
4.7.4 HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
4.7.4.1 MEASUREMENT.
Building height is measured as the vertical distance between the average natural grade between the lowest and highest grades along the foundation and 1) the average height level between the eaves and ridge line of a gable, hip or gambrel roof; or 2) the highest point of a mansard roof; or 3) the highest point of the coping of a flat roof.
4.7.4.2. EXCEPTIONS TO HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS.
Zoning district height limits shall not apply to:
 belfries, cupolas, spires, or domes,
 monuments,
 airway beacons,
 structures for essential services,
 windmills,
 flagpoles,
 chimneys and chimney flues,
 telecommunications towers (subject to the provisions of § 5.33 of this Ordinance).
 bulkhead,
 elevator,
 water tank,
 or to any similar structure or necessary mechanical appurtenance extending above the roof of any building if such structure does not occupy more than 33 percent of the area of the roof.

Article 4
Unified Development Ordinance 4-32
4.9 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD).
4.9.1. PURPOSE.
The purpose of the Planned Unit Development district (PUD) is to provide for the orderly development of land with a mix of land uses and intensity. PUD zoning is intended to permit flexibility in the design, construction and processing of residential and non-residential developments of a quality that could not be achieved under conventional zoning approaches. While the conventional zoning districts and the requirements of those districts set forth in the UDO are reasonable, there may be circumstances in which it is in the communitys best interests to allow unique and/or creative designs and techniques that:
 promote the most appropriate use of a parcel,
 allow diversification of use,
 facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets, parks, open space, schools, storm drainage and sewer and water utilities,
 preserve and utilize open space,
 offer recreational opportunities close to residential uses, and
 enhance neighborhood appearance.
4.9.2 APPLICABILITY
A PUD shall consist of not less than five (5) continuous acres.
4.9.3 PROCESSING PROCEDURES.
A PUD shall be considered a Conditional Zoning District and shall be processed in accordance with § 3.4 of this Ordinance. A major site plan shall be submitted in accordance with Appendix B.
4.9.4 PERMITTED USES.
The uses permitted in a PUD district shall be the permitted uses as set forth in the approved site plan. The site plan shall designate land use categories consistent with the zoning district classifications of this Ordinance. Within each land use category, proposed uses shall be subject only to the permitted uses in Tables 4.6-1 for each land use category and the maximum density for each land use category in Table 4.7-1. A Planned Unit Development may contain any type of Residential uses except Manufactured Homes.
4.9.5 LAND USE COMPOSITION.
No site plan for a PUD district shall be approved unless the following minimum percentages of land uses are provided for within the boundaries of the district:
 moderate density residential (4-7 units per acre) = 20%
 high density residential (8 or more units per acre) = 10%
 commercial uses as permitted in the NC, C-1, C-2, or O&I zones = 10%
 the CBD and OI zoning districts
Parks and open space shall be required in accordance with § 6.5 of this Ordinance.
4.9.6 DESIGN STANDARDS.
4.9.6.1 The land uses within a PUD shall not be subject to any of the dimensional or density provisions of § 4.7, except that a perimeter setback of 25 feet shall be maintained.
4.9.6.2 Uses within the PUD shall comply with Article 7 Buffering and Landscaping standards of this Ordinance except as otherwise provided.
4.9.6.3 Streets within the PUD shall be public streets and shall conform to the requirements of Article 10 of this Ordinance.
Article 4
Unified Development Ordinance 4-33
4.9.7 MODIFICATION OF APPROVED FINAL SITE PLAN.
Following approval of the PUD district and the Special Use Permit, no modification of the land use category designations, design standards,
uses, densities or any other condition of the site plan shall be permitted unless a new Special Use Permit is approved. However, the Department of Community Development may approve the following modifications in writing without a new site plan:
 A change in the location of not more than ten percent (10%) of the dwelling units or floor area;
 A change in the location of any part of open space acreage of not more than ten percent (10%) of the gross acreage;
 A change in the location of any part of proposed street alignment and lot configuration of not more than ten percent (10%) of the gross acreage;
 An increase or decrease of any setback by not more than five (5) feet for setbacks of less than fifty (50) feet, or ten percent (10%) for setbacks exceeding fifty (50) feet.
FIGURE 4.9-1.  RECOMMENDED DESIGN ELEMENTS FOR A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD)
Architectural Elements.
(a) Building height, rhythm, articulation, massing and bulk should be compatible with the individual site attributes and with the surrounding neighborhoods.
(b) Distinctive architectural details such as covered front entries, covered front porches, door and window details, roof overhangs, and/or parapet walls with cap features should be provided on each dwelling, or principle structure. A variety of roofing colors, textures, and component shapes including shake shingle, shale, and wood compositions, should be provided.
(c) Significant architectural differences in the choice of elevations, rooflines, and exterior colors for each residential floor plan should be provided. Not more than three (3) adjacent homes should contain the same front facade, and not more than three (3) adjacent homes should contain the same rear facade visible from arterial street view, on any block front. Homes facing one another (across the street) should not have the same facade. No adjacent home should contain the same elevation. Residential design guidelines should be provided, which include a variety of conceptual standard plans, and may include: variation in building setbacks, detached garages, recessed garages if attached to the principal building and fencing alternatives.
(d) Garage fronts should be de-emphasized and shall not be the most prominent architectural feature of the house. This should be accomplished by providing side access garages, detached in-line garages, and/or L-shaped floor plans on not less than fifty percent (50%) of the lots. Garages should be recessed at least one car length in order to provide interest and relief from the street. The front elevation should include a porch or similar entrance designed for persons rather than automobiles with the garage area not to exceed forty percent (40%) of the front facade.
Recreation Elements.
(a) Not less than 20 percent (20%) of the residential units shall be located within 660 feet of a pedestrian, equestrian and bicycle trail.
(b) Recreation and open space facilities should be aligned with the community parks and open space network, as provided in any adopted land use plans or parks and recreation master plans.
(c) Neighborhood scale recreation facilities and amenities should be provided which are functional, not retention/detention or basin-like in design. Retention basins used in conjunction with recreational facilities or amenities should be designed in accordance with the Storm water Management Standards of this Ordinance. Such areas should include turf or landscaping within all areas not permanently covered with standing water.
(d) Gateway treatments may be incorporated at appropriate locations along an open space network.
Transportation Elements.
(a) Park-and-ride lots may be incorporated with planned facilities.
(b) Bicycle lanes should be included along at least seventy percent (70%) of the linear frontage of all planned collector streets.
(c) Bicycle parking facilities should be provided for all uses except single-family detached and duplex residences.

Article 4
Unified Development Ordinance 4-34
4.9.8 DESIGN ELEMENTS.
PUD zoning is intended to permit flexibility in the design, construction and processing of residential, commercial and/or industrial developments of a quality that could not be achieved under conventional zoning concepts. Therefore, the design elements as set forth in Figure 4.9-1 shall be provided in the design of a Planned Unit Development.
All facilities including parks, open space, streets, water, sewer, storm water, and landscaping that are not dedicated to and accepted by a municipality or county shall be maintained by the following or a combination of the following:
 A condominium association, a homeowners' association, or a cooperative housing corporation; or
 A special assessment district organized pursuant to NCGS Chapter 153A, Article 9 or Chapter 160A, Article 10; or
 A public enterprise organized pursuant to NCGS Chapter 153A, Article 15 or Chapter 160A, Article 16; or
 A service district organized pursuant to NCGS Chapter 153A, Article 16; or
 A redevelopment commission organized pursuant to NCGS Chapter 160A, Article 22; or
 An authority organized pursuant to NCGS Chapter 160A, Articles 23  28, to the extent permitted by law; or
 A water or sewer authority or a water or sewer district organized pursuant to NCGS Chapter 162A.
Nothing in this Section shall require the County of Lee to approve any district or authority.
Article 4
Unified Development Ordinance 4-35
4.10 TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT
The Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) option is designed to permit the development of land in a manner consistent with the historic and timeless principles of Sanfords existing neighborhoods. A TND combines a variety of housing types with commercial and civic uses in a compact, walkable neighborhood setting. TNDs feature a highly interconnected street network and setbacks appropriate to create a public realm built on a human scale. The TND Use Pattern implements the following policies of the Land Use Plan:
 To direct new development toward less developed geographic areas of the county without encouraging urban sprawl (Goals  Community Theme).
 Increase locations for multi-family housing and overall densities (Article 4)
 Achieve quality growth (Land Use, Goal 2)
 Use existing infrastructure efficiently (Land Use, Goal 3)
 Provide long term quality development and attractive public space (Urban Design, Goal 2)
 Improve the overall appearance of the Community (Urban Design, Goal 3)
 Promote the community as a major activity center for retail, recreation, and cultural activities (Economic Development, Goal 2)
 Provide residential areas that support other land use goals by efficient and economical use of resources and minimize their effect on the natural environment (Housing , Goal 3)
 Promote a full range of housing types that include single family, multi-family, group quarters, manufactured homes, and mobile home parks that will allow all persons the opportunity to live in decent, safe, and sanitary housing (Housing, Goal 1)
 Develop a transportation system that provides safe, effective, efficient traffic flow (Transportation, Goal 1)
 Develop a comprehensive pedestrian system for the Community (Transportation, Goal 2)
 Provide residential areas that support other land use goals by efficient and economical use of resources and minimize their effect on the natural environment (Housing, Goal 3)
 Provide amenities convenient to residential areas such as shopping facilities, community facilities and services, parks and open space, natural areas, and mass transit (Housing, Goal 8)
The TND concept is particularly well suited to the Plans emphasis on identifiable neighborhoods and community. By providing compact residential development linked with pedestrian facilities, shopping and employment opportunities within walking distance of residential areas, and an identifiable edge, a TND provides a sense of community.
4.10.1 APPLICABILITY.
The provisions of this Section apply to any application for a TND as provided in § 4.10.2 hereto. Futhermore, it is understood that the standards as set forth in the remainder of this § 4.10 are intended as general guidelines for the creation of a traditional neighborhood development. A proposed TND development may deviate from the standards as set forth in this section if it can be demonstrated that the alternative approach is in keeping with the spirit of a traditional neighborhood development.
4.10.2 PROCESSING PROCEDURES.
A TND shall be considered a conditional zoning district and shall be processed in accordance with § 3.4 of this Ordinance.
4.10.3 SIZE AND LOCATION OF SITE.
4.10.3.1 LOCATION.
A TND may be located adjacent to, but shall not be bisected by, a Secondary Arterial or Primary Arterial Street unless the Street is designed to conform to the requirements of an Avenue or Main Street (see Article 10 of this Ordinance).
If the TND is located adjacent to a Collector or higher classification street and the street is not designed to conform to the standards of an
Article 4
Unified Development Ordinance 4-36
Avenue or Main Street, the following criteria shall apply:
(a) The internal streets providing access to the TND shall be aligned perpendicular to the Collector or higher order street.
(b) The buildings or structures which take access from the internal streets shall face the internal streets and not the Collector or higher order streets.
4.10.3.2 SUBAREAS.
The Site shall be divided into the following subareas:
(a) A Center (Center) consisting of Civic, Retail, Service, and Multi-family uses. The size of the Center is based on the size of the entire site, as provided in § 4.10.3.3, below.
(b) A Neighborhood or series of Neighborhoods consisting of multi-family and single-family uses, small-scale Retail and Service uses, and public outdoor gathering places. All areas within a Neighborhood shall be within 1,320 feet (1/4 mile from edge to edge. A neighborhood shall be not less than ten (10) or more than forty (40) acres in size. This land area does not include Greenbelts located on the periphery of the Neighborhood.
(c) Parks and Open Space, including a Plaza and a Greenbelt (see Parks and Open Space Standards, § 6.5 of this Ordinance). The Plaza provides a community focal point and public gathering place, while the Greenbelt provides a clear edge to the community, open space for community residents, and natural areas for storm water management.
4.10.3.3 CENTERS.
(a) The Center shall have a minimum area of 30,000 square feet. For a TND exceeding 250 dwelling units, the Center shall have a minimum area of 120 square feet per Dwelling Unit.
Example: A proposed TND has 600 dwelling units. The minimum square footage for the Center is 72,000 square feet (600 x 120).
(b) A Center shall only be located on a Main Street (see Transportation Standards).
(c) The Center may face or surround a Plaza or Square.
(d) A continuous system of sidewalks shall connect the Center with Streets and Lanes which provide access to dwelling units.

They are established for the purpose of protecting and conserving the heritage of the County of Lee, and State; for the purpose of safeguarding the character and heritage of the districts by preserving the districts as a whole and any property therein that embodies important elements of their social, economic, cultural, political, or architectural history; for the purpose of promoting the conservation of such districts or landmarks for the education, pleasure and enrichment of residents of the districts and the City of Sanford, Town of Broadway Lee County and the State as a whole; for the purpose of fostering civic beauty; and for the purpose of stabilizing and enhancing property values throughout the districts as a whole, thus contributing to the improvement of the general health and welfare of the City of Sanford, Town of Broadway, Lee County and the State and the residents of the districts. This section implements the following provisions of the Land Use Plan:
 Maintain the historic character of the Community (Historic Preservation, Goal 1)
 Identify future Historic Districts (Historic Preservation, Goal 2)
 Maintain the integrity of existing Historic Districts, and expand Historic Districts where possible (Historic Preservation, Goal 3)
4.12.2 HISTORIC DISTRICT ESTABLISHMENT.

4.12.2.2 Historic districts, as provided for in this section, may from time-to-time be designated, amended, or repealed, provided; however, that no district shall be recommended for designation unless it is deemed to be of special significance in terms of its history, prehistory, architecture, and/or culture and to possess integrity of design, setting, materials, feeling, and/or association. No district shall be designated, amended, or repealed until the following procedure has been carried out:
(a) An investigation and report describing the significance of the buildings, structures, features, sites, or surroundings included in any such proposed district, and a description of the boundaries of such district has been prepared, and;
(b) The Department of Cultural Resources, acting through the State Historic Preservation Officer or his or her designee, shall have made an analysis of and recommendations concerning such report and description of proposed boundaries.

Failure of the Department to submit its written analysis and recommendations to the appropriate Governing Body within 30 calendar days after a written request for such analysis has been received by the Department of Cultural Resources shall relieve the appropriate Governing Body of any responsibility for awaiting such analysis, and the appropriate Governing Body may at any time thereafter take any necessary action to adopt or amend its Zoning Ordinance.
(c) The appropriate Governing Body may also, in its discretion, refer the report and the proposed boundaries to any other interested body for its recommendations prior to taking action to amend the Zoning Ordinance.
(d) With respect to any changes in the boundaries of such district subsequent to its
Article 4

(b) Interior arrangement or design shall be exempt from review by the Historic Preservation Commission. Interior construction and/or reconstruction shall not require a Certificate of Appropriateness.
4.12.10 CERTAIN CHANGES NOT PROHIBITED.
Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in the historic district which does not involve a substantial change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent the construction, alteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature which the Building Inspector, Zoning Enforcement Officer or similar official shall certify in writing to the Historic Preservation Commission is required by the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent (a) the maintenance, or (b) in the event of an emergency, the immediate restoration, of any existing above-ground utility structure with approval by the Historic Preservation Commission.
4.12.11 DELAY IN DEMOLITION.
4.12.11.1 An application for a Certificate of Appropriateness authorizing the demolition, removal, or destruction of a designated landmark or a building structure or site within a historic district may not be denied. However, the effective date of such a certificate may be delayed for a period of up to 365 days from the date of approval. The period of delay shall be reduced by the Historic Preservation Commission if it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use or return from such property by virtue of the delay. During the delay period the Historic Preservation Commission shall negotiate with the owner in an effort to find a means of preserving the building, structure, or site. If the Historic Preservation Commission finds that a building, structure, or site has no special significance or value toward maintaining the character of a district, it shall waive all or part of such period of delay and authorize earlier demolition or removal.
4.12.11.2 In the case of action initiated by the appropriate Governing Body, the application for such a certificate will first be reviewed by the Historic Preservation Commission and then by the appropriate Governing Body for a final order of demolition or removal. The Historic Preservation Commission shall consider the Code Enforcement Officers inspections and recommendations for demolition or removal of the building or structure.
If the Historic Preservation Commission has voted to recommend the designation of a landmark or the designation of an area as a historic district and the final designation has not been made by the appropriate Governing Body, the demolition or destruction of any building, structure, or site in the proposed district or on the property of the designated landmark may be delayed by the Historic Preservation Commission for up to 180 days or until the appropriate Governing Body takes final action on the designation, whichever occurs first.

4.14.2.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL WATER SUPPLY WATERSHED AREAS
The following general provisions apply to all Watershed Overlay Districts. These provisions and the provisions contained in the Individual Watershed Overlay Districts are designed to protect the water quality of the Water Supply Watersheds that lie within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance and to implement the rules adopted by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission for the classified watersheds pursuant to NCGS § 143-214.5.
(a) The construction of new roads and bridges and non-residential development should minimize built-upon area, divert storm water away from surface water supply waters as much as possible, and employ best management practices (BMPs) to minimize water quality impacts. To the extent practicable, the construction of new roads in the Critical Area should be avoided. The N.C. Department of Transportation BMPs as outlined in their document entitled "Best Management Practices for the Protection of Surface Waters" shall be used in all road and bridge construction projects in the Watershed Overlay Districts.
(b) All development activities within Watershed Overlay Districts, in addition to those activities specifically regulated by these provisions, are subject to the standards, usage conditions and other regulations contained in the Rules and Requirements of the Surface Water Supply Protection Rules adopted by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission.
(c) A minimum 30-foot vegetative buffer for development activities is required along all perennial waters, including streams, rivers and impoundments, indicated on the most recent versions of United States Geodetic Survey (USGS) 1: 24,000 scale topographic maps; provided, that nothing in this Subsection shall prevent artificial stream bank or shoreline stabilization. No new development is allowed in the buffer, except that water dependent structures, or other structures such as flagpoles, signs, and security lights, which result in only diminimus increase in impervious area and public works projects such as road crossings and greenways may be allowed where no practicable alternative exists. These activities shall minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from the surface water, and maximize the utilization of BMPs.
(d) Where otherwise permitted in the underlying Primary Zoning District, Cluster Subdivision is allowed on a project-by-project basis as follows:
 The overall density of the project meets the density requirements of this Ordinance;
 The appropriate vegetative buffer in subsection (c), above, is provided;
 Built upon areas are designed and located to minimize storm water runoff impact to the receiving waters, minimize concentrated storm water
Article 4
Unified Development Ordinance 4- 63
flow, and to maximize the flow length through vegetated areas;
 Areas of concentrated development are located in upland areas and away, to the maximum extent practicable, from surface waters and drainage ways;
 Remainder of tract to remain in vegetated or natural state;
 The area in the vegetated or natural state may be conveyed to a property owners association; a local government for preservation as a park or greenway; a conservation organization; or placed in a permanent conservation or farmland preservation easement. A maintenance agreement shall be filed with the property deeds and;
 Cluster Subdivision shall transport storm water runoff from the development by vegetated conveyances to the maximum extent practicable.
(e) All development in Watershed Overlay Districts, shall, to the maximum extent practical, minimize built-upon surface area, direct storm water runoff away from surface waters and incorporate best management practices to minimize water quality impacts.
(f) Existing development, as defined in this Ordinance, is not subject to the requirements of the overlay provisions. Expansions to structures classified as existing development must meet the requirements of these provisions, provided however, the built-upon area of the existing development is not required to be included in the density calculations. In determining expansions to existing development, the maximum permitted additional built-upon area is derived by multiplying the area of the portion of the property that is not built-upon by the appropriate percent built-upon limitation for the Overlay District in which the property is located.
(g) A pre-existing lot created prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, regardless of whether or not a vested right has been established, may be developed or redeveloped for single-family residential purposes without being subject to the restrictions of these overlay provisions.
(h) Any existing building or built-upon area not in conformance with the limitations of these provisions that has been damaged or removed for any reason may be repaired and/or reconstructed, provided:
 Repair or reconstruction is initiated within twelve (12) months and completed within two (2) years of such damage or removal.
 The total amount of space devoted to built-upon area may not be increased.
 The repair or reconstruction is otherwise permitted under the provisions of this Ordinance.
(i) No activity, situation, structure or land use shall be permitted or allowed to operate within a watershed which poses a threat to water quality and the public health, safety and welfare. Such conditions may arise from inadequate on- site sewage systems which utilize ground absorption; inadequate sedimentation and erosion control measures; the improper storage or disposal of junk, trash or other refuse within a buffer area; the absence or improper implementation of a spill containment plan for toxic and hazardous materials; the improper management of storm water runoff; or any other situation found to pose a threat to water quality.
(j) Existing lots which do not meet the minimum lot size standards of this Ordinance shall not be required to recombine to meet such minimum standards. However, such lots may be required to be recombined to meet the standards of other Ordinances.

The Watershed Administrator shall maintain a record of the total acreage in the DRGG-WS-IV-PA area eligible for SIAs, the acreage that has been allocated and the acreage that has been used as of the latest date. In no case shall allocated acreage exceed the acreage eligible for allocation. For the purpose of this subsection, the total area that can be allocated for SIAs in the DRGG-WS-IV-PA is 653.5 acres.
2. SIAs shall be allocated on a first come, first served basis upon the approval and issuance of the appropriate permit.
3. The right to develop a SIA shall terminate with the loss of the right to develop due to the expiration of any Permit issued for development. In such a case, the allocated acreage, or unused allocated acreage, shall be returned to the unallocated total acreage eligible for allocation.
4.14.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS
4.14.3.1 RULES GOVERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF WATERSHED AREA BOUNDARIES

Article 4
Unified Development Ordinance 4- 69
4.14.4.4 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE WATERSHED REVIEW BOARD
(a) Administrative Review. The Watershed Review Board shall hear and decide appeals from any decision or determination made by the Watershed Administrator in the enforcement of this Ordinance.
(b) Variances from watershed requirements. The Board may authorize variance from the specific requirements of the Watershed provisions in the same manner and subject to the same procedures and requirements of the Lee County Zoning Ordinance for authorizing other variances, provided that:
(c) The required notice shall also be mailed by first class mail to all other local governments having watershed regulation jurisdiction within the particular watershed where the variance is requested and to each entity using that water supply for consumption; and
(d) If the variance request is for a major variance as defined herein the following procedure shall apply. If the Board decides in favor of granting the major variance, the Board shall then prepare a preliminary record of the hearing and submit it to the EMC for review and action. If the Board does not decide in favor of granting the major variance such unfavorable action shall constitute denial.
In the event of a favorable action by the Board on a major variance, the Board shall cause the record of their hearing to be promptly submitted to the EMC. The record of the hearing shall include but not be limited to:
 The variance application;
 The hearing notices;
 The evidence presented;
 Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence and rulings on them;
 Findings and exceptions;
 The action of the Board including any conditions proposed.
If the EMC approves the major variance or approves with conditions or stipulations added, the EMC shall prepare a decision which authorizes the Board to issue a final decision which would include any conditions or stipulations added by the EMC. If the EMC denies the major variance, then the EMC shall prepare a decision and transmit it to the Board. The Board shall then prepare a final decision denying the major variance.
(e) Adjusting Watershed Area Boundaries. The Watershed Review Board, in addition to its authority contained in Section 404(A) in Administrative Review, shall have the power to make adjustments to the exterior boundary of Watershed Areas by removing all or part of a piece of property from a Watershed Area where it finds that all or part of such property actually lies outside the drainage area of such Watershed. In any case, where there is a dispute as to whether a property or any part of a property that is shown on the Watershed Map is being in a Watershed Area actually drains to that Watershed, the Board shall, upon appeal by the owner, make a determination as to the facts of the matter as it affects the subject property.
In determining whether a property or part of a property drains to the Watershed as indicated on the Map, the Board shall base its determination on actual field conditions of the property as determined by topographical conditions. In making its determination, the Board may require the appellant to produce relevant expert testimony and exhibits.
After hearing such appeal, the Board shall find that the subject property (all or part) is either in the designated Watershed or out of the designated Watershed. If the Board shall find that the subject property is out of the designated Watershed, the Board shall order the Map to be adjusted to show the subject property to be outside the designated Watershed. In making such order, the Board shall designate the Watershed in which the subject property is located. If such designation causes the subject property to be located in another Watershed Area, the order shall cause the Map to be adjusted to show the same.
(f) Adjusting Critical Area Boundaries. The Watershed Review Board may, upon the request of a property owner or owners, adjust the boundaries of a Watershed Critical Area to fit existing or proposed streets, lot lines or other features, provided that such adjustments are agreed to by the property owner(s) involved and
Article 4
Unified Development Ordinance 4- 70
provided that any such adjustment is made with no loss in total area in that Watershed Critical Area. Such adjustment may be made by simple majority vote of the Board without public notice.
(g) Appeals from Decision of the Watershed Review Board. Any decision of the Watershed Review Board is subject to review by the Superior Court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Any petition for review in the Superior Court shall be filed with the Clerk of Superior Court within thirty (30) days after the decision of the Board is filed in the office of the clerk, or after a written copy thereof is delivered to every aggrieved party who has filed a written request for such copy with the Secretary or Chairman of the Board at the time of its hearing of the case, whichever is later. The decision of the Board may be delivered to the aggrieved parties either by personal service or by registered mail or certified mail return receipt requested.
(h) Changes and Amendments to the Watershed Protection Ordinance. The appropriate Governing Body may amend, supplement, change or modify the Watershed regulations and restrictions as set forth herein in the manner prescribed by law for adopting ordinances under its general ordinance-making authority. Provided, however, in any case where an amendment to this Ordinance imposes water supply watershed management requirements that are more stringent than those adopted by the EMC, the procedure must comply with the provisions of NCGS §§ 153A-343 or 160A-384 .
Under no circumstances shall the Governing Body adopt such amendments, supplements or changes that would cause this ordinance to violate the watershed protection rules as adopted by the EMC. All amendments must be filed with the Division of Water Quality, Division of Environmental Health, and the Division of Community Assistance.
4.14.5 PENALTIES & REMEDIES
4.14.5.1 GENERAL PENALTY; ENFORCEMENT; CONTINUING VIOLATIONS

(b) Violations of this Ordinance shall constitute either a misdemeanor or, at the election of the County, shall subject the offender to a civil penalty upon the issuance of a citation for said violation as hereinafter provided. The civil penalty, if not paid to Lee County within fifteen days of the issuance of a citation, may be recovered by the County in a civil action in the nature of debt. Said civil penalties shall be in the amount of $100 for each violation and each day any single violation continues shall be a separate violation.
(c) In addition to the civil penalties set out above, any provision of this Ordinance may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. In such case, the general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application of the County for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law.
(d) In addition to the civil penalties set out above, any provision of this Ordinance that makes unlawful a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced by injunction and order of abatement by General Court of Justice. When a violation of such a provision occurs, the County of Lee may apply to the appropriate division of the General Court of Justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and/or order of abatement commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cause the unlawful use of the property. The action shall be governed in all respects by the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including the Rules of Civil Procedure in general and Rule 76 in particular.
(e) An order of abatement may direct that buildings or other structures on the property be closed, demolished or removed; that fixtures, furniture or other movable property be removed from buildings on the property; that improvements or repairs be made; or that any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance
Article 4
Unified Development Ordinance 4- 71
with this Ordinance. If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for contempt, and the County may execute the order of abatement. The County shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanics and materialmans lien. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by the Clerk of Superior Court in an amount approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the defendants full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith.
(f) The provision of the Ordinance may be enforced by one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this section.
(g) Upon determination of a violation of any section of this Ordinance, the penalty for which is a civil penalty, the appropriate Watershed Administrator of Lee County shall cause a warning citation to be issued to the violator. Such citation shall set out the nature of the violation, the section violated, the date of the violation, and shall contain an order to immediately cease the violation. If the violation is in the nature of an infraction for which an order of abatement would be appropriate in a civil proceeding, a reasonable period of time must be stated in which the violation must be abated. Where the Watershed Administrator determines that the period of time stated in the original warning citation is not sufficient for abatement based upon the work required, The Watershed Administrator may amend the warning citation to provide for additional time. The warning citation shall specify that a second citation shall incur a civil penalty, together with costs, and attorney fees.
(h) An appeal from a warning citation shall be taken within ten (10) days from the date of said warning citation to the Watershed Review Board. Except in any case where the Ordinance specifically grants to the Board other powers in considering appeals and such appeal is applied for, the Board in considering appeals of warning citation shall have power only in the manner of administrative review and interpretation where it is alleged that the Watershed Administrator has made an error in the application of the Ordinance, in the factual situation as it relates to the application of the Ordinance, or both.
(i) Upon failure of the violator to obey the warning citation a civil citation shall be issued by the Watershed Administrator and either served directly on the violator, his duly designated agent, or registered agent if a corporation, either in person or posted in the United States mail services by first class mail addressed to the last known address of the violator as contained in the records of the County or obtained from the violator at the time of issuance of the warning citation. The violator shall be deemed to have been served upon the mailing of said citation. The citation shall direct the violator to pay the citation in person within fifteen days of the date of the citation, or alternatively to pay the citation by mail. The violation for which the citation is issued must have been corrected by the time the citation is paid; otherwise further citations may be issued. Citations may be issued for each day the offense continues until the prohibited activity is ceased or abated.
(j) If the violator fails to respond to a citation within fifteen days of it issuance, and pay the penalty prescribed therein, Lee County may institute a civil action in the nature of debt in the appropriate division of the North Carolina General Court of Justice for the collection of the penalty, costs, attorney fees, and such other relief as permitted by law.
4.14.5.2 ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES.
Nothing in this Ordinance nor any of its provisions shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the County to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise, nor shall enforcement of one remedy provided therein prevent the enforcement of any other remedy or remedies provided herein or in other ordinances or laws.
In addition to the penalties and remedies provided for herein, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission may

4.15 RESIDENTIAL DESIGN STANDARDS OVERLAY DISTRICT (RDSOD) (City of Sanford Zoning Jurisdictions Only)
4.15.1 PURPOSE
The Residential Design Standards Overlay District (RDSOD) is created to allow for application of specific regulations and/or design principles as it related to residential development in order to promote the appearance of and to protect the value of our neighborhoods. Standards as found within n this section shall apply to all residential developments, including apartment complexes or other multi-family dwellings, as located within the boundaries of the overlay zoning district. This overlay district is only available within the zoning jurisdiction of the City of Sanford.
4.15.2 DESIGN STANDARDS.
4.15.2.1 Fences. The purpose of this section is to set forth regulations for fences throughout the overlay district.
4.15.2.2 Definitions.
 Fence  A structure serving as an enclosure, a barrier, or a boundary, usually made of posts or stakes joined together by boards, wire, or rails.
 Open-style Fence - A fence of open construction is one in which the ratio of the open portion to the closed portion is at least 1 to 1 per foot. Typical examples of open fencing include chain link, split-rail, or picket fences (with appropriately spaced pickets).
 Closed-style Fence - A fence of closed construction is one in which the ratio of the closed portion to the open portion is more than 1 to 1 per foot. Typical examples of closed fencing include stockade fences.
 Sight Triangle  An area that prohibits the placement of objects, such as fences, which could obstruct the ability of motorists to view opposing traffic
movements at intersections. Sight triangles are determined by measuring along the edge of each intersecting street or driveway a predetermined distance and then connecting those points with a line. The area within these lines is considered the sight triangle. For public streets, the predetermined measuring distance is sixty (60) feet. For private driveways, the predetermined measurement distance is ten feet. See figure below.
 Yard Area, Front  The land area of a parcel or tract that is defined by the boundary of the area between a street right of way and the front façade of the closest principal structure.
 Yard Area, Side - The land area of a parcel or tract that is defined by the boundary of the area between an adjoining property boundary and any side façade of the closest principal structure.
 Yard Area, Street Side  In the case of a corner lot, the land area of a parcel or tract that is defined by the boundary of the area between a street right of way and a side façade of the closest principal structure.
 Yard Area, Rear - The land area of a parcel or tract that is defined by the boundary of the area between an adjoining property boundary and the rear façade of the closest principal structure.
4.15.2.1.2 Location of fences.
4.15.2.1.2.1 Adjoining parcels. Fences maybe erected right up to the property line, no setback required. An exception to this is when the fence placement would prevent the use of adjacent property or prevent the safe use of a driveway. In these cases, the Enforcement Officer may require the fence to be set back a minimum distance from the driveway or property line.
4.15.2.1.2.2 Adjoining streets or driveways.
Article 4
Unified Development Ordinance 4- 75
Fences maybe erected right up to a street right-of-way line or edge of a driveway, except that no fence shall be erected within a sight triangle of a street or driveway unless such fence is thirty (30) inches or less in height.
4.15.2.1.3 MATERIALS AND FINISH.
4.15.2.1.3.1 Fences shall consist of materials commonly used in conventional fence construction, such as wood or metal. Fences located in the front and street side yard area must be of open-style wood construction (includes decorative fences as defined in Section 4.15.2.1.1) with a maximum of height of four (4) feet. Fences located in the rear yard or interior side yard areas may be of open-style or closed-style construction with a maximum height of six (6) feet.
4.15.2.1.3.2 The following fences are prohibited on lots developed for residential use:
 Barbed wire fences
 Electric wire fences, unless used for containment of domestic pets and/or livestock as permitted under this Ordinance
 Chain link fences that include fabric or other material woven into the fence that creates an opaque or semi-opaque fence
4.15.2.1.3.3 If, because of design or construction, one side of the fence has a more finished appearance than the other, the side of the fence with the more finished appearance shall face the exterior of the lot.

4.16 MINING SPECIAL USE OVERLAY DISTRICT (MSUOD).
4.16.1 PURPOSE P&S Section 1
Mining and quarrying is an industryare industries which may play an important part in the countys economy. Mining is aand quarrying are peculiar land uses in that the location of mineral, stone and other deposits will, in part, be determined only after exploration and discovery in the future. Consequently, the precise location of zoning districts wherein mining may take place cannot always be predetermined. In addition, mineral extraction involves several methodsquarrying, open-pit, drilling, tunneling, etc.each of which would affect the surrounding environment differently. Therefore, the governing board of Lee County concludes that the fundamental purposes and procedures of zoning would be served best by adopting a Mining Special Use Overlay District, which can be applied to certain underlying districts if approved by the respective governing board, and that the Board of Adjustment should consider each location proposed to be mined to determine whether, and under what conditions or safeguards, they should authorize mining and quarrying by the issuance of a Special Use Permit.
4.16.2 APPLICABILITY P&S Section 2
4.16.2.1 Establishment. P&S Section 3 The Mining Special Use Overlay Districts (MSUOD) is hereby established as a district which may be overlaid on the following underlying zoning districts to permit mining and quarrying in the MSUOD.
 RA Residential Agricultural
 LI Light Industrial
 HI Heavy Industrial
Do we want to limit to these 3 zones? I doubt the City and Broadway want mining allowed in the urban zoning districts.
4.16.2.2 Special Use Permit Required. If a MSUOD is approved, no mining or quarrying may commence until a Special Use Permit is also approved. The Special Use Permit shall conform to the specific standards of Section 5.23 as well as the general development standards of this UDO. Added this for more clarity on SUP requirements
4.16.2.3 Definition. For the purposes of this Ordinance, Mining and Quarrying shall include any operation or land activity as defined under the category Mining and Quarrying in Appendix A of this Ordinance.
4.16.3 DEFINITIONS. P&S Section 4
The following additional definitions apply to this Section 4.16:
Affected land means the surface area of land that is mined or quarried, the surface area of land associated with a mining activity so that soil is exposed to accelerated erosion, the surface area of land on which overburden and waste is deposited, and the surface area of land used for processing or treatment plant, stockpiles, nonpublic roads, and settling ponds.
Land shall include submerged lands underlying any river, stream, lake, sound, or other body of water.
Minerals means soil, clay, coal, stone, gravel, sand, phosphate, rock, metallic ore, and any other solid material or substance of commercial value found in natural deposits on or in the earth.
Overburden means the earth, rock, and other materials that lie above the natural deposit of minerals.
Reclamation plan shall mean that plan required by the state as part of an application for a mining permit and defined in N.C. Gen. Stat. § 74-49.

4.16.5.1 As noted in Section 4.16.2.2, a Special Use Permit is also required upon successful rezoning and application of a MSUOD. As such, application for the Special Use Permit shall be in accordance with Section 3.5 of this Ordinance. Added this for more clarity on SUP requirements
4.16.5.2 To aid in the interpretation of the word harmony in Section 3.5.3.4 as applied to an application for Special Use Permit for mining and quarrying, the following guidelines may shall be used:
 The operation will not constitute a substantial physical hazard to a neighboring residence, school, church, hospital, commercial, or industrial building, public road, or public property;
 The operation will not have a significantly adverse effect on the purposes of a publicly owned park, forest, or recreation area;
 The operation will not have an adverse effect on public, community, or private water supplies, surface or ground waters, including but not limited to water supply watershed areas as designated in the Watershed Protection Map of Lee County, North Carolina.
4.16.5.3 A special use approval granted by the Board of Adjustment will not become effective until a mining permit, if required by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, and all other state and federal permits required for mining are issued.
4.16.5.4 If the applicant makes a material and substantial change to the Site Plan or any of the other components submitted to the Board of Adjustment, a new special use permit application shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustment.
4.16.5.5 A special use permit will automatically expire if, at any time after it is approved by the Board of Adjustment, the state mining permit is revoked or terminated and may be reactivated upon reissuance of the state mining permit unless there is a material and substantial change requiring a new special use permit application according to Section 4.16.5.4 above.
4.16.5.6 APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS P&S Section 7
4.16.5.6.1 The special use permit application shall also include two (2) copies of all other applications for federal and state permits required for mining. Such copies shall be complete and include all required supporting documentation as required for said permits.

supporting documentation as required for said permits.
4.16.5.6.4 The special use permit application shall also include a traffic impact study by a qualified consultant that will enable the Board of Adjustment to assess the impact of the proposed land use on the highway system when that system is at or near capacity or a safety problem exists. Its purpose is to ensure that the proposed land use does not adversely affect the highway network and to identify any traffic problems associated with access from the proposed site to the existing transportation network. The study shall also to identify improvements to resolve traffic problems and present solutions that may be incorporated in the Site Plan. The study shall also include information sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the Road and Traffic Standards in this section. If requirement for a traffic impact study is included, there is no current staff member qualified to review/analyze the findings of the impact study. Is County willing to use 3rd party contractor to review as discussed? As a precedent, we do have telecommunication towers (cell tower) SUP applications reviewed by a 3rd party consultant prior to BoA hearing. The applicant is required to pay a fee of $4,000 for this review along with the normal filing fee.
4.16.5.6.5 If the proposed affected land is greater than ten (10) contiguous acres, the special use permit application shall include a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the proposed affected land completed not earlier than 12 months before the special use permit application date and prepared in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials.
This was suggested by the Merritt proposal, but we never discussed whether to exclude or keep. Again, no current staff qualified to review/analyze the findings. Again, is County willing to use 3rd party contractor to review as discussed?
4.16.5.6.6 The special use permit application shall include a major site plan as set forth in Appendix B-5 of this Ordinance. In addition to the site plan, the application shall also include an Operations Plan that details:
 Details on how the mine will operate (where will initial excavation begin, where will overburden be placed, etc.)
 Hours of operation
 Number of employees, including details on shifts if applicable
 Details on the function of each proposed structure or piece of equipment
 Location of permanent roads (those to be used in excess of one year) and non-permanents roads
New section added to correspond to proposed changes to Section 5.23
4.16.5.6.7 The special use permit application shall include a copy of the mining reclamation bond as required by NCGS 74-51 and 74-54 and as submitted to the NC Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ). This is a substitute for P&S Section 9
4.14.24.16.6 PERMITTED USES (UNDERLYING ZONING DISTRICTS) P&S Section 6
A Mining Special Use Overlay District will be an overlay on an underlying zoning district required specifically for mining and quarrying. All other uses permitted in any such underlying district, whether by right or as a Special Use, shall be permitted in the MSUOD according to the procedures established for such uses.

It will typically include the disconnection of the facility from the electrical grid and the removal of all facility components, including the ground-mounted solar panels with any racking & supports, inverter units, substation, transformers and other electrical equipment, access roads, underground cable, communication tower, perimeter fence and any concrete foundations.
A decommissioning plan signed by the party responsible for decommissioning and the landowner (if different) addressing the following items shall be provided to staff as part of the Special Use Permit application submittal:
 The anticipated life span of the solar farm.
 The estimated decommissioning costs in current dollars.
 The method for ensuring that funds will be available for decommissioning & restoration.
 Defined conditions upon when decommissioning will be initiated (i.e. end of land lease, no power production for 12 months, etc.).
 Removal of all non-utility owned equipment, conduit, structures, fencing, and foundations. This includes the removal of solar panels/arrays, buildings, cabling, electrical components, and any other associated facilities above or below grade that were installed as part of the solar collector facility.
 Removal of all graveled areas and access roads unless the landowner requests in writing for it to stay in place.
 Restoration of property to condition prior to development of the solar collection facility, including replacement of top soil removed or eroded and re-vegetation of any cleared areas with warm season grasses that are native to the region, unless requested in writing by the landowner not to re-vegetate due to plans for agricultural planting.
Article 5
Unified Development Ordinance 5- 54
 The timeframe for completion of decommissioning activities.
 Description of any agreement (e.g. lease) with landowner regarding decommissioning.
 The party currently responsible for decommissioning.
 Plans for updating this decommissioning plan.
After approval of the Special Use Permit by the Board of Adjustment, but prior to the issuances of a zoning approval/certification by the Sanford/Lee County Planning & Development Department, the applicant must provide the Sanford/Lee County Planning Department with a certified cost estimate and a performance guarantee for decommissioning. The performance guarantee must be in the form of a surety or performance bond that renews automatically, includes a minimum 60-day notice to the Sanford/Lee County Planning & Development Department prior to cancellation, is approved by the Director of the Sanford/Lee County Planning & Development Department, and is from a company on the U.S. Department of Treasurys Listing of Certified Companies. The amount of the performance guarantee must be one and a quarter times the estimated decommissioning cost, minus the salvageable value or $50,000.00, whichever is greater. Estimates for decommissioning the site and salvage value shall be determined by a professional engineer or a general contractor licensed to practice in the state of North Carolina. A new estimate and a new bond certificate must be submitted to the Sanford/Lee County Planning & Development Department each year verifying that the bond is still an adequate amount to ensure compliance with the ordinance and to ensure that it has been properly renewed. The full amount of the bond must remain in full force and effect until the solar collector facility is decommissioned and any necessary site restoration is complete.
After approval of the Special Use Permit, but prior to the final electrical inspection, the decommissioning plan shall be recorded at the Lee County Register of Deeds Office and a recorded copy shall be provided to staff. If the decommissioning plans are modified, a copy of the modified decommissioning plan as recorded at the Lee County Register of Deeds Office shall be provided to staff. In the event of a change of ownership of the facility, the new owner of the facility must provide an updated signed decommissioning plan within 30 days of the change of ownership.
A solar collector facility that ceases to produce energy on a continuous bases for 12 months will be considered abandoned unless the current responsible party (or parties) with ownership interest in the facility provides substantial
evidence (updated every 6 months after 12 months of no energy production) to the Sanford/Lee County Planning & Development Department of the intent to maintain and reinstate the operation of that facility. It is the responsibility of the responsible party (or parties) to remove all equipment and facilities and restore the land to its prior condition according to the approval decommissioning plan within 90 days of the established date of abandonment or a time period agreed upon by staff.
If the applicant ceases operation of the energy facility or begins, but does not complete, construction of the project, the applicant shall restore the site according to the approved decommissioning plan within 90 days of the established date of abandonment or a time period agreed upon by staff.
The landowner or tenant must notify the Sanford/Lee County Planning & Development Department when the site is abandoned and when the site is properly restored as per the approved decommissioning plan. The performance guarantee shall be released by staff once the site is properly restored as per the approved decommissioning plan and inspected by staff.

Unified Development Ordinance 6- 6
6.3 MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS
6.3.1 MAJOR SUBDIVISION DEFINED
A major subdivision is defined as any subdivision which is not classified as a minor subdivision including, but not limited to (1) subdivisions of six (6) or more lots; or (2) any size subdivision which requires the extension of a public or private street; or (3) any size subdivision which requires the extension of public water, sewer or other public improvements; or (4) any size subdivision which requires an exception from the requirements of this ordinance. The following steps are required:
 Sketch Plat
 Preliminary Plat
 Final Plat
6.3.2 SKETCH PLAT SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.
6.3.2.1 PURPOSE
The sketch plat approval process and preapplication conference provides an opportunity for the applicant to present its basic concept to local planning officials and receive their input, suggestions and concerns. This procedure permits the developer to go before the Department of Community Development with the description, but not full engineering details of the project. The sketch plat lays out the approximate location of existing features and planned construction and provides ownership information. Because of the preliminary and summary description of the development, the sketch plat does not permit development. However, the developer is given the opportunity to learn of suggestions which can be incorporated into the formal preliminary plan application without incurring significant expenditures.
6.3.2.2 INITIATION
The applicant shall schedule an appointment and meet with the Department of Community Development to discuss a sketch plat. The Department of Community Development shall also advise the applicant, when appropriate, to discuss the proposed subdivision with those officials who must eventually approve those aspects of the subdivision plat coming within their jurisdiction. If the plat is to be submitted in two (2) or more phases, a Master Plan shall be submitted which shows the sketch plat and preliminary plat for the entire subdivision.
6.3.3 PRELIMINARY PLAT
6.3.3.1 PURPOSE
The preliminary plat application involves an examination of the proposal in much greater detail than at the sketch plat stage, since this stage determines whether the project will be approved, and if so, the conditions that will be required. Preliminary plat approval is the key discretionary decision-making point in the approval process. The applicant is required to submit, as applicable, detailed information as to all aspects of the development, including street layout, preservation of natural site features, and recreational and parking facilities, in order to assure that the decision-makers and all parties interested in the project have the opportunity to review all significant facets of the project.
6.3.3.2 APPLICABILITY
Approval of a Preliminary Plat is required for any tract where the eventual platting of the property involves a major subdivision. No final plat shall be approved until a Preliminary Plat for the property has been approved.
6.3.3.3 INITIATION
After the Department of Community Development has approved a sketch plat for a major subdivision, then the subdivider may file an application for approval of a preliminary plat. The application shall be filed with the Department of Community Development.
6.3.3.4 DECISION
(a) After the application for preliminary plat approval is certified as complete, the Department of Community Development shall place the plat on the agenda of the next regularly-scheduled meeting of the appropriate local Planning Board.
Article 6
Unified Development Ordinance 6- 7
(b) The Department of Community Development shall refer copies of the plat and any accompanying material to those public officials and agencies concerned with new development, including, but not limited to, the building inspector, Lee County Health Department, Lee County School Board, the district engineer of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, the appropriate county soil conservation service office, and any consulting engineer retained by the Jurisdiction, for review and recommendation. Such agencies may review and comment as to whether the application satisfies the requirements of this Ordinance or any other requirements of state or federal law applicable to subdivision plats. A preliminary plat shall not be placed on the local Planning Board agenda until it has been deemed complete by the Department of Community Development.
(c) The Planning Board shall review and take action on each preliminary plat. The Planning Board shall approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the application for a preliminary plat subject to the following:
 Approval shall be noted on at least two copies of the preliminary plat. One (1) copy shall be retained by the Community Development Department, and one (1) copy shall be given to the subdivider.
 If the preliminary plat is disapproved, the minutes shall specify the reasons for such action in writing. One (1) copy of such reasons shall be retained by the local Planning Board, and one (1) copy of such reasons shall be given to the applicant. If the preliminary plat is disapproved, the subdivider may make the recommended changes and submit a revised preliminary plat.
 If the preliminary plat is conditionally approved, the minutes shall specify the reasons for such action in writing. One (1) copy of such reasons shall be retained by the planning commission, and one (1) copy of such reasons shall be given to the applicant. If the preliminary plat is conditionally approved, the subdivider may make the recommended changes and submit a revised preliminary plat to the Administrator for review.
 A timely decision of the Planning Board to approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the application for a preliminary plat shall be considered final and shall be referred to the appropriate Governing Body for review.
(d) The preliminary plat shall then be transmitted to the Governing Body for consideration at their next regular meeting. A timely decision of the Governing Body to approve or disapprove, the application for a preliminary plat shall be considered final.
6.3.3.5 SCOPE OF APPROVAL
6.3.3.5.1 Approval of the preliminary plat by the Governing Body shall allow a subdivider to proceed with the preparation of the final plat.
6.3.3.5.2 Approval of the preliminary plat by the Governing Body without approved construction plans shall not constitute the necessary approval for submittal of the final plat.
6.3.3.5.3 Should the plat be approved subject to conditions or labeling corrections, the plat shall be revised and resubmitted to the Department of Community Development with all corrections within 60 days of the Governing Bodys approval. Failure to return a corrected plat within this time period shall constitute a violation. Additionally, no final plat may be approved until a corrected copy of the preliminary plat has been filed with the Department of Community Development.
6.3.3.5.4 The preliminary plat shall serve as a guide in the preparation of the final subdivision plat, which must be submitted for final approval and recordation upon fulfillment of the requirements of this Article.
6.3.3.5.5 The preliminary plat shall be valid for two (2) years after its final approval. A
preliminary plat shall become void if a final plat
is not approved within this time period. Final
Approval of a phase or portion of a preliminary
plat shall re-establish the effective date for
measuring the time period of a preliminary plat
approval.
Article 6

 A change in the location of not more than ten percent (10%) of the number of lots;
 A change in the location of any part of open space acreage by not more than ten percent (10%) of the gross acreage of the proposed subdivision; or
 A change in the location of any part of proposed street alignment and lot configuration of more than ten percent (10%) of the gross acreage so long as the number of external access points is not decreased and the minimum street connectivity ratio as set forth in Article 10 is maintained.
 Changes to within parcel boundaries which do not affect external property lines.
6.3.3.6.2 Major Amendments. All other changes to an approved Preliminary Plat that do not meet the standards of this Section shall require the filing and approval of a new Preliminary Plat.
6.3.3.7 PHASING OF PRELIMINARY PLAT
6.3.3.7.1 A preliminary plat may be approved with multiple phases where it is the intent of the landowners to proceed to final plats covering only a portion of the tract at any one time.
6.3.3.7.2 For each approved phase, the developer shall have up to two (2) years to submit the final plat for that respective phase.
6.3.3.7.3 The applicant may submit for an extension of the approved phase beyond the two year limit. Application shall be made to the Department of Community Development for forwarding and review by the Planning Commission at their next regular meeting.
6.3.4 FINAL PLAT
6.3.4.1 PURPOSE
This section establishes procedures for the administrative approval of final plats. The purpose of a final plat is to ensure that all the conditions attached to preliminary approval (in the case of a major subdivision) and this Ordinance (in the case of major or minor subdivisions) are complied with. This section also permits a subdivider to take necessary actions to prepare maps, plats and documents, post a performance bond, and perform other minor acts. This section does not permit the Department of Community Development to attach new conditions to final approval or to deny final approval for reasons not presented during preliminary approval.
6.3.4.2 APPLICABILITY
There shall be a final plat for each subdivision which receives preliminary plat approval.
No final subdivision plat shall be recorded until a final plat has been approved as provided in this Section.
6.3.4.3 INITIATION
The materials required by Appendix B shall be submitted to the Department of Community Development for a determination as to whether it complies with the approved preliminary plat. The subdivider may submit final plat copies for only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which is proposed for recordation and development at that time, if such portion conforms to all requirements of this Article. The final plat shall conform to the approved preliminary plat. Any deviation from the approved preliminary plat which does not constitute a Minor Amendment as set forth in TU§ 6.4.3.7UT shall require additional review and approval by the Planning Commission.
6.3.4.4 DECISION
6.3.4.4.1 Upon submittal of the copies of the final plat and other required materials, the Department of Community Development shall review the application for completeness and shall initiate and coordinate review by affected local and state agencies in order to determine substantial compliance with the approved preliminary plat and general compliance with the provisions of this ordinance and other applicable laws and regulations.
Article 6
Unified Development Ordinance 6- 9
6.3.4.4.2 The final plat and related materials shall be approved or disapproved by the Department of Community Development. Approval shall be in the form of a written letter to the subdivider (or contact person as listed on the application) advising that the final plat meets all requirements of this Ordinance and that the original final plat may be submitted to the Department of Community Development.
6.3.4.4.3 Upon receipt of all necessary signatures of the final plat, the applicant shall record it with the Register of Deeds.
6.3.4.4.4 Except as provided in TU§ 6.4.6UT (Subdivision Improvement Agreements), all applicants shall complete, all street, sanitary, and other public improvements of the subdivision as required by this Ordinance before the final plat is recorded. Such public improvements shall be accepted by the Department of Community Development, the Department of Public Works (within the incorporated area and ETJ of the City), the North Carolina Department of Transportation (as applicable), and any other agency with jurisdiction to review and inspect such improvements.
6.3.4.4.5 The final subdivision plat application shall be accompanied by all formal irrevocable offers of dedication to the public of all streets, local government uses, utilities, parks, and easements, in a form approved by the respective Attorney; and the subdivision plat shall be marked with a notation indicating the formal offers of dedication as provided in Appendix B.
6.3.4.4.6 Whenever a subdivider applies for approval of a final plat which contains only a portion of the land encompassed in the approved preliminary plat and which includes required open space, the subdivider shall either apply for dedication of the land as included in the phase or provide a financial contribution which is proportional to the population expected to reside in the area of the final plat. The financial contribution shall be calculated in the same manner as set forth in Section 6.5.4 of this Ordinance.
6.3.4.5 RECORDING A FINAL PLAT
The applicant shall file the plat with the Register of Deeds as provided by law within ninety (90) days after final approval. The final plat approval shall expire within the above-referenced time period, unless the Department of Community Development has granted an extension. Failure to record the final plat within the time frame noted shall cause the final plat approval to be void, and shall require a new application. The applicant shall return a reproducible (mylar) copy of the recorded plat to the office of the Department of Community Development.
6.3.5. SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENT AGREEMENTS.
6.3.5.1 COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS
6.3.5.1.1 The Department of Community Development may delay the requirement for the completion of required improvements prior to recordation of the Final Plat if the applicant enters into a Subdivision Improvement Agreement by which the applicant agrees to complete all required on-site and off-site public improvements no later than one (1) year following the date upon which the final plat is recorded. Such period may be extended for up to an additional six (6) months upon its expiration upon approval by the appropriate Governing Body. The Applicant shall bear the responsibility to prepare a Subdivision Improvement Agreement. The City of Sanford, Town of Broadway, or Lee County Attorney shall approve any Subdivision Improvement Agreement as to form.
6.3.5.1.2 At the discretion of the Department of Public Works, the Department of Public Works may enter into a subdivision improvement agreement with the applicant for a development containing multiple final plats concerning the timing and sequence of roadway, water, wastewater, drainage, public school, and park or open space dedication and improvements. Notwithstanding any provision in this Ordinance to the contrary, the subdivision improvement agreement shall determine the time when the required improvement or dedication for multiple final plat developments shall occur.

Article 7
Unified Development Ordinance 7- 1
7.1 PURPOSE
7.1.1. The purpose of these landscaping, screening, and buffer requirements is to provide standards that will protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public, enhance property values, improve the appearance of the community, and preserve natural resources, trees, and native plants. Planting yard regulations are established herein to minimize potential conflicts between abutting developments, enhance the appearance of buildings and parking lots, and create a unified and attractive streetscape. These minimum requirements will:
 Reduce soil erosion and increase infiltration in permeable land areas essential to storm water management and aquifer recharge;
 Mitigate air, dust, noise, heat and chemical pollution;
 Reduce the heat island effect of impervious surfaces, such as parking lots, by cooling and shading the surface area and breaking up large expanses of pavement;
 Establish a landscape theme including street trees and streetscape designs to be used throughout the County of Lee to promote the overall character and identity of the community;
 Address the design of entryways into the County of Lee to express the communitys values;
 Preserve existing native vegetation as an integral part of the wildlife habitats, and incorporate native plants and ecosystems into landscape design;
 Promote innovative and cost-conscious approaches to the design, installation, and maintenance of landscaping while encouraging water and energy conservation;
 Promote planting techniques that ensure long term health of plant materials;
 Screen unsightly equipment or materials from the view of persons on public streets or adjoining properties and buffering from incompatible land uses;
 Promote walkable pedestrian-scale streetscapes, traditional neighborhoods, and compact centers by exempting uses which relate to each other functionally and visually from certain requirements of this Section.
7.2 APPLICABILITY.
7.2.1 This Article 7 shall apply to all new construction projects that include (a) non-residential development and/or (b) multi-family development ( three or more dwelling units), except as follows:
 Agricultural uses as listed in the Use Matrix (NAICS Code 11; LBCS Function Code 9110 and Structure Code 8000);
 Any use, building or structure for which only a change of use is requested, and which requires no structural modifications which would increase its volume, scale or intensity;
 Any site containing an unoccupied public utility equipment structure that is less than 1,000 square feet in area, except that all electrical substations shall install a minimum Type B buffer per § 7.5, below.
 Developments in the Central Business District (CBD) zoning district shall be exempt from this Article 7, except that in instances where off-street parking is provided voluntarily, such parking area shall include the planting yards as set forth in § 7.6 Parking Lot Yards and § 7.7 Street Yards.
7.2.2 Single-family detached homes and individual duplexes on individual lots are exempt from the standards of this Article 7.

7.4 PLANTING YARDS
.
7.4.1 PURPOSE.
Planting yards are intended to aesthetically enhance and separate different land uses and zoning districts from each other, as well as to beautify individual sites, the roadside or streetscape, and are intended to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt, litter, glare of lights, and unsightly buildings or parking areas.
Planting yards shall include the following:
 Buffer Yards (see § 7.5 of this Article)
 Parking Lot Yards (see § 7.6 of this Article)
 Street Yards (see § 7.7 of this Article)
7.4.2 APPLICABILITY.
Planting yards shall be required for all uses except:
7.4.2.1 Subdivisions;
7.4.2.2 agricultural uses as listed in the Use Matrix (NAICS Code 11; LBCS Function Code 9110 and Structure Code 8000);
7.4.2.3 any use, building or structure for which only a change of use is requested, and which requires no structural modifications which would increase its volume, scale or intensity;
7.4.2.4 developments in the CBD Central Business District (except that the Parking Lot yard requirements of § 7.6 shall apply);
7.4.2.5 sites containing unoccupied public utility equipment that are less than 1,000 square feet in area, except that all electrical substations shall install a minimum Type B buffer per § 7.5, below.
7.4.3. RELATIONSHIP TO BUILDING SETBACK YARDS.
For purposes of this section, building setback yards (as listed in § 4.7) shall be concurrent with planting yard requirements. Landscaping as required within a planting yard shall be counted for only that planting yard and shall not be used in calculating the minimum quantity for any other planting yard.
7.4.4 RELATIONSHIP TO SIGHT TRIANGLES/TRAFFIC VISIBILITY.
No plantings as required within this Article 7 shall be installed such that the planting will create a traffic hazard or otherwise inhibit the view for vehicular traffic at intersections or other vehicular traffic movements. No plantings in excess of three feet shall be permitted within any designated sight triangle.
Article 7
Unified Development Ordinance 7- 4
7.5 BUFFER YARDS.
7.5.1 PURPOSE.
The purpose of buffer yards is to provide a transitional buffer between uses that may differ in development intensity and density, or to provide a minimum buffer between uses of similar intensity and density. These landscaped planting yards are intended to ensure that a natural area of appropriate size and density of plantings is planted or preserved between zoning districts and/or uses. Buffer yards shall be of different types, based upon the relationship between the two adjacent land uses between which the buffer yard is to be located. The width of the buffer yard and the density of plantings increase as the difference between adjacent land uses increases.
7.5.2 APPLICABILITY.
In addition to the exemptions as set forth in § 7.4.2, certain uses are exempt from the buffer requirements as described in this section.
Exemptions include, but are not limited to, the following:
 Lots or parcels separated by a public street right-of- way greater than 30 feet in width;
 Lots or parcels separated by a railroad right-of-way.
7.5.3 YARD TYPES.
7.5.3.1 There are five different classes of land uses for purposes of determining the buffer yard type. Land use classes are based upon the specific land use to be developed, which is permitted either by right or conditionally, or the groupings of zoning districts or land use groupings as provided in Table 7.2.
7.5.3.2 Table 7-3 identifies the buffer yard type required for a given development, based on the relationship between the adjacent land uses. If an adjoining parcel is undeveloped, the minimum buffer shall be determined based on the zoning of the adjoining property.
7.5.3.3 Table 7-4 contains the required plantings and dimensions of the respective buffer yard types. The width of the buffer yard and the density of plantings increase as the difference in the nature and intensity of development in the respective adjacent land uses increases.
7.5.4 STANDARDS FOR BUFFER YARD DEVELOPMENT.
7.5.4.1 PROHIBITED USES.
The construction of any building or the placement of any mechanical equipment within the buffer yard is not permitted except for equipment necessary for the provision of utilities. Signs may be placed within the buffer yard consistent with the Sign Regulations (Article 11) of this Ordinance.
Circulation drives, parking lots, and other vehicular surfaces are not permitted in the buffer yard. However, the buffer requirements of Table 7-3 may be waived for non-residential uses which abut one another and can provide evidence of an appropriately designed shared vehicular area along the common property line. In such cases, Parking Lot Yard landscaping of Section 7.6 of this Ordinance shall be required.
7.5.4.2 CALCULATING REQUIRED LANDSCAPING
7.5.4.2.1 Required Planting Area. Total landscaping required within a buffer yard is set forth in § 7.5.4.2.2, below. Width for a buffer yard shall be measured from the respective property line, except where buffer yards are permitted to straddle property lines, as set forth in § 7.5.4.4. Where buffer yards turn at property corners, the length measurements determining plant quantities are not required to overlap.
7.5.4.2.2 Calculating Required Plantings. The total amount of required landscaping within a required buffer yard shall be calculated based on a point system. The point system, as established in Table 7-1 below, ensures that a minimum level of landscaping is achieved during development while maintaining flexibility. Five different plant types are assigned a unique point value. Table 7-1 is to be used in conjunction with the Table 7-4 to determine the specific total of required landscaping. When calculating points, or quantities of plants, fractions shall be rounded
Article 7
Unified Development Ordinance 7- 5
upward to the higher whole number for decimals of 0.5 and higher. Decimals below 0.5 shall be rounded downward to the lower whole number. Table 7-1 shall be used to determine minimum amounts for new planting areas, as well as in determining credits for preservation of existing vegetation as permitted under § 7.5.4.3, below.

7.5.4.3 EXISTING VEGETATION.
Existing healthy vegetation may be counted toward the required landscaping, if it is used as a year-round sight obstruction buffer. The Community Development Department may conduct site inspections in order to determine whether the existing vegetation is useable as a sight obstruction buffer. In order to do so, the landscape plan shall indicate the type, number and size of existing plants which are sufficient to comply with the respective buffer yard. It shall not be necessary to indicate the total inventory of existing plants. Only plants required to meet the provisions of this Ordinance are required to be listed.
7.5.4.4 BUFFER YARD ON PROPERTY LINE.
Applicant may establish a buffer yard that straddles the property line, provided the cumulative buffer width is maintained for both yards.
7.5.4.5 VISUAL SEPARATION.
This Section 7.5.4.5 applies only where complete visual separation is required by another provision of this Ordinance. Where complete visual separation is required, it may be accomplished through the use of landscaping which provides year-round opaque screening, earth berms, masonry walls, or fences constructed of pressure-treated wood or other wood resistant to deterioration due to exposure to weather, moisture and insects, or a combination of two or more of these techniques. Even where complete visual separation is achieved, the landscaping and buffer yard requirements still apply.

7.6 PARKING LOT YARDS.
7.6.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of parking lot yards is to aesthetically and visually enhance the appearance of parking lots.
7.6.2 APPLICABILITY.
Parking lot yards are based upon the size of the respective parking lot. The size of the required parking lot yard increases as the size of the respective parking lot increases. Minimum dimensions shall apply, and shall be measured, horizontally. The requirements of this section shall apply to all new and expanded (5 or more added spaces) parking lots and parking lots for land uses that have substantially changed. If an existing parking lot (paved or unpaved) is expanded or improved to add 5 or more spaces, it shall comply with the parking lot landscaping requirements within the expanded or improved portion. If a parking lot is expanded or developed, then street yard, buffer yard and parking lot yard landscaping requirements shall apply.
7.6.3 DESIGN CRITERIA.
7.6.3.1 MINIMUM QUANTITY OF LANDSCAPE PLANTINGS.
Landscaped planting areas and islands for parking lot yards shall have one (1) large tree or two (2) small trees, and eight (8) small shrubs per each twenty (20) parking spaces.
7.6.3.2 MINIMUM DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERIOR PLANTING ISLANDS.
Interior planting islands shall be not less than nine (9) feet in width and shall include a minimum of 150 square feet of open planting area for trees. Shrubs or ground covers may be planted within the required open planting area for trees without increasing the area. All landscaped areas shall be protected from vehicular encroachment by concrete curb and gutter where curb and gutter is required for adjoining streets by Article 6. Landscaped areas shall be covered with mulch, ground cover or grass between shrub and tree plantings.
Article 7
Unified Development Ordinance 7- 9
7.7 STREET YARDS.
7.7.1 PURPOSE.
The purpose of street yards is to aesthetically and visually enhance the appearance of a site or development along a public street frontage, creating a pleasing view from the road, and establishing a transition from vehicular thoroughfares, pedestrian areas or the built environment.
7.7.2 APPLICABILITY.
Site plans shall require street yards in accordance with the design specifications of this Ordinance. A street yard shall be required on a site along all frontages where a project or development abuts a public street right-of-way.
Minimum dimensions shall apply, and shall be measured, horizontally. Widths shall be measured from the respective right-of-way/property line. Where street yards turn at street corners, the length measurements determining plant quantities are not required to overlap.
7.7.3 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
7.7.3.1 Required street yards shall maintain a width of eight (8) feet and shall include a minimum of one large (1) tree or two (2) small trees for every fifty linear feet of required street yard as measured parallel to the adjoined street right-of-way.
7.7.3.2 In situations where required street yard landscaping may create a sight distance conflict with an existing or proposed driveway/intersection, the required trees may be clustered with other plantings so as to maintain a proper sight distance.
7.7.3.3 The construction of any building or the placement of any mechanical equipment within a street yard is not permitted except for equipment necessary for the provision of utilities. Signs may be placed within a street yard consistent with the Sign Regulations (Article 12) of this Ordinance.
Article 7
Unified Development Ordinance 7- 10
7.8 SPECIFICATIONS FOR PLANT MATERIALS AND INSTALLATION.
7.8.1 SIZE STANDARDS.
The minimum allowable plant size for new installations shall be as set forth herein. Due to the variation between genus and species, the caliper or height necessary for newly installed plant materials may vary.
7.8.1.1 LARGE TREES.
Large trees (see also Appendix C) shall measure a minimum 1.5 to 2 inches in caliper, and 8 to 10 feet in height at the time of planting.
7.8.1.2 SMALL TREES.
Small trees (see also Appendix C) shall measure a minimum 1.5 to 2-inches in caliper for single-stem trees or 1 to 1.5-inches in caliper for multi-stem trees, and at least 6 to 8 feet in height at the time of planting.
7.8.1.3 LARGE SHRUBS.
Large shrubs (see also Appendix C) shall measure a minimum of 3 to 3½ feet in height at the time of planting. Shrubs planted for screening purposes shall form the required density to block visibility within three (3) years from the date of installation.
7.8.1.4 MEDIUM SHRUBS.
Medium shrubs (see also Appendix C) shall measure a minimum of 2 to 3 feet in height at the time of planting. A mix of deciduous and evergreen shrubs is encouraged in order to obtain a variety of color and texture throughout the year.
7.8.1.5 SMALL SHRUBS.
Small shrubs (see also Appendix C) shall measure a minimum of 18 to 24 inches in spread and/or height at the time of planting. A mix of deciduous and evergreen shrubs is encouraged in order to obtain a variety of color and texture throughout the year.
7.8.1.6 GROUND COVER (ORGANIC).
Living ground covers shall provide 100 percent coverage on the ground within one (1) year of installation, except for mulch or turf which shall provide 100 percent coverage upon installation. Organic mulch may be used around plantings to maintain soil moisture and prevent the growth of weeds, but cannot be substituted for required plantings. Inorganic ground covers consisting of river rock or similar materials may be substituted for organic ground cover.
7.8.2 SELECTION OF PLANT MATERIALS.
All plant material, except Ground Covers, shall be selected from Appendix C (Acceptable Plant Species) or a species to be approved by the Community Development Department. Consideration shall be given to the environmental conditions of the site, such as soil, topography, climate, microclimate, pattern of sun movement, prevailing winds and precipitation, and air movement to ensure that plant materials will be established successfully. Tree selection for street yards, or other locations within utility rights-of-way, shall consider the presence or planned addition of overhead utility lines. Such trees shall be small and medium trees that are pest- and disease-resistant and are slow growing. The Department of Community Development may approve the installation of comparable substitution plant materials to satisfy the requirements of the approved landscape plan when the approved plants and landscape materials are not available at the time that installations are to occur, or when other unforeseen conditions prevent the use of the exact materials shown on the approved landscape plan. Significant changes that require the replacement and relocation of more than 25 percent of the plant materials shall require a new landscape plan and approval through the plan review process.
7.8.3 MIX OF GENUS AND SPECIES ENCOURAGED.
Except for Street Yard trees (§ 7.7), a mix of genus and species of trees, shrubs, ground covering, perennials and annuals is encouraged, but not required, in order to avoid potential loss due to infectious disease, blight, or insect
Article 7
Unified Development Ordinance 7- 11
infestation. Street Yard Trees should retain a reasonably uniform pattern along a street within the same block or corridor.
7.8.4 STANDARDS FOR INSTALLATION OF LANDSCAPING MATERIALS.
Preparation of plant pits, hedge trenches and shrub beds should be done in conformance with accepted installation practices. Leaflet #601, Planting Techniques for Trees and Shrubs, as published by the North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service, (1997), is a suggested resource.

Article 10
Unified Development Ordinance 10- 11
exempt only if access is via a secondary street.
 This shall not apply to the CBD Central Business District zoning classification except as located within the Town of Broadway.
10.7.3 BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS.
10.7.3.1 SCALE. One of the most important concerns regarding development within our gateway corridors is to ensure that new buildings or structures are designed so as to conform to the built environment in terms of massing and location. The location and height of all proposed structures shall be designed so as to maintain an appropriate sense of scale (proportional relationship between building and spaces to people) as established by existing development along a given corridor. New structures shall be designed so as to be in conformity with the surrounding environment. Large expanses of building mass shall be avoided, however, where large structures are necessary, mass shall be broken by the use of setbacks, projecting and recessed elements and other similar design techniques.
10.7.3.2 BUILDING LINE. Buildings shall be located on the site such that the façade closest to the adjoining thoroughfare or freeway will be consistent with the established building line along a given street corridor. If such a building line is not clearly established, then the front building line shall be located somewhere between the closest and deepest building lines as measured parallel to the street corridors right-of-way for a distance of 500 feet in each direction. If it is determined that this § 10.7.3.2 cannot be complied with due to existing physical or topographic constraints which cannot be reasonably corrected, the Administrator shall have the authority to waive this requirement.

 The preponderance of existing structures adjoining the thoroughfare or freeway in the vicinity of the proposed development include the same alternative exterior material/design as requested for the new construction; and
 The requested alternative material does not consist of concrete block, smooth-faced tilt-up concrete panels or pre-fabricated steel panels.
10.7.3.4 EXTERIOR BUILDING COLORS. Facade colors shall consist of low reflectance, subtle, neutral or Earth Tone colors. Bright colors shall be limited to use as accent elements, such as door and window frames and architectural details. Use of neon tubing and/or fluorescent colors is prohibited.
10.7.3.5 ENTRYWAY. If an entrance to a principal building is visible from a corridor street, such entrances shall feature at least one of the following design elements: canopies or porticos, arcades, arches, or wing walls.
10.7.3.6 MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT. To the greatest extent possible, mechanical appurtenances and equipment should be located within the structure. External mechanical appurtenances, such as heating and air conditioning equipment, shall be screened from view from the adjoining thoroughfare or freeway. Screening materials shall be finished to match the colors of the adjacent building exterior.
10.7.3.7 ACCESSORY STRUCTURES. To the greatest extent possible, all accessory structures shall conform to the building design standards of this § 10.7.3.

11.1 PURPOSE & FINDINGS
11.1.1 This sign ordinance is adopted under the zoning authority of the County of Lee in furtherance of the more general purposes set forth in this Ordinance. The purposes of these sign regulations are:
(a) to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the County of Lee while preserving the rights of free speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution;
(b) to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the County of Lees ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; to improve pedestrian and traffic safety;
(c) to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; and
(d) to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions.
11.2 APPLICABILITY
A sign may be constructed, erected, placed, established, painted, created, or maintained in the County of Lee only in conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions, and other requirements of this Ordinance. The effect of this Ordinance as more specifically set forth herein is:
11.2.1 To establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in commercial and industrial zones, and a limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards and the permit procedures of this Ordinance;
11.2.2 To allow certain signs that are small, unobtrusive, and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this Ordinance, but without a requirement for permits;
11.2.3 To prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this Ordinance; and
11.2.4 To provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance.
11.2.5 The physical alteration of a sign face or supporting structure shall be considered the same as construction of a new sign, which shall require a permit and conformity to all the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance. However, repainting of a sign or replacement of a sign face shall be considered maintenance or repair and shall not require a permit.
11.2.6 Notwithstanding any provision in this Article to the contrary, non-commercial copy may be placed on any otherwise permissible sign in place of commercial copy.
11.2.7 Existing signs that are required to be moved as a result of a public infrastructure improvement project (e.g., a road widening project) may be relocated and shall not be deemed because of that relocation to violate the requirements of this article, provided there is not any expansion, addition or structural change or new sign plan and/or design for that sign. If a pylon sign is to be relocated, the sign shall be relocated to meet the appropriate setback as set forth in this Article 11.
11.3 SIGN PERMIT
11.3.1 APPLICABILITY.

 Computation of the maximum total sign area, the maximum area for individual signs, the height of signs and the number of freestanding signs allowed on the lot(s) or parcel(s) included in the plan under this Ordinance; and
An accurate indication on the plot plan of the proposed location of each present and future sign of any type, whether requiring a permit or not. Incidental signs need not be shown.
11.4 SIGN AREA COMPUTATIONS

11.4.2 COMPUTATION OF AREA OF MULTI-FACED SIGNS.
The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be the maximum total area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two sign faces are placed back to back, they cannot be more than forty-two (42) inches apart.
11.4.3 HEIGHT.
The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be either of (1) existing grade prior to construction or (2) newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the Principal Structure on the lot or parcel, whichever is lower.
11.5 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE

UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE
ARTICLE 12. NONCONFORMITIES AND VESTED RIGHTS
Summary: This Article defines legal nonconforming uses of land, nonconforming structures and lots. Further, it addresses the extent to which nonconforming situations may continue, the scope of permissible nonconformities, and permitted changes and extensions. This Article also includes the procedures necessary to obtain a vested right for a site specific development as well as rules regarding the expiration of time limits for development approvals.

Article 12
Unified Development Ordinance 12- 1
12.1 PURPOSE
12.1.1 The purpose of this Article is to address the continuation of nonconforming situations and to protect vested rights. Its purpose is to protect private landowners by protecting their right to continue uses or planned projects, while protecting the public from speculative projects which do not conform to modern planning and design principles. A nonconforming situation typically addresses a condition that legally existed when this Ordinance was adopted, but which is not now permitted by the Ordinance. By contrast, a vested right occurs where a property owner has proceeded to a given stage in the approval process, but does not require that the use already be in existence.
12.2 LEGAL NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS CONTINUED
12.2.1 Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Article and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in this Article 12, nonconforming situations that legally existed prior to the effective date of this Article may be continued. Legal nonconforming situations shall include all lots, uses and/or structures that were considered substandard, but legally allowed to continue on or before the effective date of this Ordinance.
Article 12
Unified Development Ordinance 12- 2
12.3 UNDEVELOPED NONCONFORMING LOTS
12.3.1 APPLICABILITY
This section applies only to undeveloped lots that are considered nonconforming or substandard with respect to their dimensional standards in relation to the current zoning. A lot is considered undeveloped if it has no substantial structures on it.
12.3.2 NONCONFORMITIES AS TO LOT SIZE
12.3.2.1 When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use, except that the lot is smaller than the required minimums set forth in § 4.7, then the lot may be used as proposed subject to the standards set forth in this Section 12.3. However, no use (e.g., a two-family residence) that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a particular zone is permissible on a noncon-forming lot.
12.3.2.2 Permits may be granted for structures to be built on a nonconforming lot, except that such structure shall conform to all setbacks as required in Table 4.7-1 and as set forth in § 4.7. If the proposed structure cannot comply with the building setbacks, the Administrator may allow a reduction not to exceed twenty-five percent (25%) in the dimension of any required setback yard. Approval shall depend upon a written finding that such reduction is reasonably necessary for practical use of the lot and will not have substantial adverse effects on adjacent property.
12.3.3 MERGER OF NONCONFORMING LOTS
If a property owners desires to develop an undeveloped nonconforming lot which adjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other undeveloped lots (conforming or nonconforming) under the same ownership, the lots must be combined or merged prior to the issuance of any development permits. The intent of this requirement is to require that nonconforming lots be reassembled in as much as possible to create conforming lots.
.
Article 12
Unified Development Ordinance 12- 3
12.4 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND
12.4.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Section 12.4 is to address standards for the expansion, alteration, and/or discontinuance of nonconforming uses of land.
12.4.2 DISCONTINUANCE
12.4.2.1 When a nonconforming use is (i) discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days, or (ii) discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use, the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes.
12.4.2.2 For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter.
12.4.2.3 When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this Article is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this Article, the 180-day period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of this Article.
12.4.3 CHANGE OF USE
12.4.3.1 A Nonconforming Use shall not be changed to another Nonconforming Use.
12.4.3.2 A Nonconforming Use may be changed to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located, provided compliance can be achieved with the Change of Use standards in Section 3.2.4.2 of this Ordinance.
12.4.4 EXPANSION OF USE
12.4.4.1 A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed, enclosed building that already houses or contains the same legal nonconforming uses. Open areas such as storage yards, loading docks, carports, etc. shall not be eligible for this expansion provision.
12.4.4.2 A nonconforming use of open land that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a sand pit) may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established.
12.4.5 REPLACEMENT OF MANUFACTURED HOMES ON INDIVIDUAL LOTS
12.4.5.1 LEE COUNTY & CITY OF SANFORD. In any zoning district, an existing, nonconforming manufactured home on an individual lot may be replaced with a Class A or Class B manufactured home (see definition of Manufactured Home in Appendix A) provided the replacement home is placed on the site within 180 days of the removal of the previous home.
12.4.5.2 TOWN OF BROADWAY.
12.4.5.2.1 In any zoning district except as set forth in 12.4.5.2.2 below, an existing, nonconforming manufactured home may be replaced with a Class A or Class B manufactured home (see definition of Manufactured Home in Appendix A) provided the replacement home is placed on the site within 180 days of the removal of the previous home and provided that the replacement unit is not more than ten (10) year old.
12.4.5.2.2 Within the Towns R-20 zoning district, existing nonconforming manufactured homes on individual lots may be replaced only with a Class A (double-wide) manufactured home subject to the following additional conditions:
 The pitch of the roof of the home shall have a minimum vertical rise of five feet for each 12 feet of horizontal run
Article 12
Unified Development Ordinance 12- 4
(5 in 12) and the roof shall be finished with shingles.
 The exterior siding shall consist predominately of vinyl or aluminum lap siding, wood or hardboard.
 A continuous, permanent foundation (unpierced except for typical ventilation) shall be required.
 The tongue, axles, transporting lights, and any other removable towing apparatus shall be removed upon final placement on the site.
 A minimum of 1,200 sqaure feet of interior space shall be required.
Article 12
Unified Development Ordinance 12- 5
12.5 NONCONFORMING STRUCUTRES
12.5.1 EXPANSION OF NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
12.5.1.1 Except as stated below, no person may engage in the physical alteration of A nonconforming structure if such activity results in:
 An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use, or
 Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements, height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking requirements.
12.5.1.2 EXCEPTION FOR SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL.
Any structure used for single-family residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to such matters as setbacks and parking requirements. This paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in § 12.4.2 (discontinuance of nonconforming uses).
12.5.1.3 EXCEPTION FOR MODERNIZATION OF BILLBOARDS IN THE CITY OF SANFORD.
Within the City of Sanford, any billboard that existed as of July 1, 2016 as a legal nonconforming structure may be modernized in accordance with Section 11.9.
12.5.2 REPAIRS AND RENOVATION
12.5.2.1 Where a non-conforming building or other non-conforming structure is damaged or destroyed as a result of fire or other natural/uncontrollable factor, such building or structure may be reconstructed provided that any such reconstruction does not increase the
degree of any nonconformance with respect to building setbacks, and only upon receipt of a Zoning Clearance Permit. Except, however, the non-conforming single-wide manufactured homes that are destroyed as a result of fire or other natural disaster event, such home may be replaced subject to meeting the standards of Section 12.4.5 of this Ordinance.
12.5.2.2 If a nonconforming structure is voluntarily altered or expanded, such structure and site shall be subject to all applicable design standards of this Ordinance.
12.5.2.3 Routine maintenance and general repair of an existing nonconforming structure shall be permitted provided such repair work does not constitute an expansion or enlargement.
Article 12
Unified Development Ordinance 12- 6
12.6 VESTED RIGHTS.
12.6.1 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
The purpose and intent of this Section is:
(1) To provide detailed administrative rules, regulations and procedures in order to guide officials in the administration, interpretation and implementation of the Unified Development Ordinance, and/or any other ordinances, regulations and or administrative rules adopted by the County of Lee in order to implement a comprehensive plan for development.
(2) To establish predictability and fairness for affected landowners;
(3) To recognize that development projects for which vested rights have been obtained must be accounted for in the Sanford/Lee County 2020 Land Use Plan, the Unified Development Ordinance, capital improvements programs, and other land development regulations.
(4) To provide a method for determining and quantifying the number of projects, development projects, and land uses, which do not now comply with this Ordinance, or which may in the future fail to comply with this Ordinance due to subsequent amendments to this Ordinance but which are vested, so that such projects, development projects and land uses can be accounted for in the existing and future general plans and this Ordinance.
(5) To establish uniform and non-burdensome procedures and specific criteria for the determination of vested rights and claims of equitable estoppel in order to aid in the accomplishment of sound and orderly planning;
(6) To define the scope of vested rights that have been obtained by virtue of prior development approvals, including the expiration of development permits;
(7) To protect legitimate investment-backed expectations;
(8) To protect the planning and implementation process;
(9) Settle potential disputes and to minimize protracted and costly litigation;
(10) To facilitate implementation of the goals, objectives and policies set forth in the Comprehensive Plan;
(11) To ensure that all applicable legal standards and criteria are utilized in the determinations to be made hereunder; and
(12) To implement the provisions of NCGS § 160A-385.1 Vested Rights.
12.6.2 APPLICABILITY.
This Section shall apply to any person(s) desiring to obtain a right to develop land beyond the time limitations as set forth in other sections of this Ordinance.
12.6.3 AUTHORIZATION
The provisions of this section 12.6 are authorized by NCGS § 160A-385.1 Vested Rights.
12.6.4 ESTABLISHMENT OF VESTED RIGHTS.
12.6.4.1 A Vested Right shall be deemed established for any property upon the approval (with or without conditions) of a Site Specific Development Plan or a Phased Development Plan by the appropriate decision-maker in accordance with the provisions of this section.
12.6.4.2 Any Site Specific Development Plan that will require a Variance be obtained in order to conform to this Ordinance shall obtain said Variance prior to the establishment of any Vested Rights.
12.6.4.3 An amendment or modification of a Site Specific Development Plan or Phased Development Plan shall not extend the Vested Rights period unless the approval shall specifically provide for such extension.
12.6.4.4 A Building Permit which is issued for a development for which Vested Rights have been established shall not expire or be revoked because of the time limitations on validity of permits under NCGS §§ 153A-358
Article 12
Unified Development Ordinance 12- 7
and 160A-418 prior to the expiration of the Vested Rights period.
12.6.4.5 Where a Variance is required as a condition of the approval of a Site Specific Development Plan, the effective date of the approval which commenced the period for development shall be the date on which the Variance is granted.
12.6.4.6 A right to develop a Building or Structure or Use which has been vested as provided in this section shall terminate at the end of the applicable vesting period for all Buildings or Structures and Uses for which no valid application for a Building Permit has been filed.
12.6.4.7 VOLUNTARY ANNEXATION.
12.6.4.7.1 In accordance with NCGS § 160A-31(h) and 160A-58.1(d), petitioners filing for voluntary annexation shall also submit a statement declaring whether or not vested rights with respect to the properties subject to the petition have been established. Whenever the County of Lee acquires jurisdiction over a territory that theretofore has been subject to the jurisdiction of another local government, any person who has acquired vested rights under a permit, certificate, or other evidence of compliance issued by the local government surrendering jurisdiction may exercise those rights as if no change of jurisdiction had occurred. The County of Lee may take any action regarding such a permit, certificate, or other evidence of compliance that could have been taken by the local government surrendering jurisdiction pursuant to its ordinances and regulations.
12.6.5 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF A VESTED RIGHT.
12.6.5.1 The procedures for approval of a Site Specific Development Plan are set forth in § 12.6.7. The procedures for approval of a Phased Development Plan are set forth in § 12.6.7.
12.6.5.2 Upon approval of a Site Specific Development Plan or a Phased Development Plan, each and every map, plat, site plan or other document prepared or used for the Development shall contain the following notation:
 Approval of this Site Specific Development Plan establishes a Vested Right under North Carolina General Statutes [§ 160A-385.1 within the incorporated area of the County or ETJ] [§ 153A-344.1 within the unincorporated areas of Lee County]. Unless terminated at an earlier date, the Vested Right shall be valid until [date approved by Jurisdiction].
12.6.6 SCOPE OF VESTED RIGHTS.
12.6.6.1 Following approval or conditional approval of a site specific development plan or a phased development plan, nothing in this section shall exempt such a plan from subsequent reviews and approvals by the County of Lee to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with said original approval. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the County of Lee from revoking the Zoning Clearance Permit for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions of the approval or this Ordinance as set forth in Section 1.6.
12.6.6.2 A vested right, once established as provided for in this section, precludes any zoning action by the County of Lee which would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as set forth in an approved site specific development plan or an approved phased development plan, except:
(a) With the written consent of the affected landowner;
(b) Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and a public hearing, that natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the site specific development plan or the phased development plan;
(c) To the extent that the affected landowner receives compensation for all costs, expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and
Article 12
Unified Development Ordinance 12- 8
other consultant's fees incurred after approval by the County of Lee, together with interest thereon at the legal rate until paid. Compensation shall not include any diminution in the value of the property which is caused by such action;
(d) Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and a hearing, that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations which made a difference in the approval by the County of Lee of the site specific development plan or the phased development plan; or
(e) Upon the enactment or promulgation of a State or federal law or regulation which precludes development as contemplated in the site specific development plan or the phased development plan, in which case the County of Lee may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in State or federal law has a fundamental effect on the plan, by ordinance after notice and a hearing.
(f) The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning which imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land-use regulation by the County of Lee, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes. Otherwise applicable new regulations shall become effective with respect to property which is subject to a site specific development plan or a phased development plan upon the expiration or termination of the vesting rights period provided for in this section.
(g) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the establishment of a vested right shall not preclude, change or impair the authority of the County of Lee to adopt and enforce zoning ordinance provisions governing nonconforming situations or uses. (See Article 13 of this Ordinance).
12.6.6.3 A vested right obtained under this section is not a personal right, but shall attach to and run with the applicable property. After approval of a site specific development plan or a phased development plan, all successors to the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such rights.
12.6.6.4 Nothing in this section shall preclude judicial determination, based on common law principles or other statutory provisions, that a vested right exists in a particular case or that a compensable taking has occurred. Except as expressly provided in this section, nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the existing common law.
12.6.7 SITE-SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT PLANS (SSDPs).
12.6.7.1 GENERAL.
The appropriate Governing Body may, but under no circumstances is it required, to approve a Site-Specific Development Plan (SSDP). The SSDP shall bind the applicant and the County of Lee (the "parties") and shall contain those terms and conditions agreed to by the parties and those required by this Section. The Department of Community Development and the Attorney for the City, Town or County, or their designees, are authorized to negotiate SSDPs.
12.6.7.2 APPLICABILITY.
The applicable Governing Body may approve a SSDP pursuant to this Section only if the proposed development to which the SSDP pertains is in conformity with the then adopted Comprehensive Plan and capital improvements program, zoning regulations, and other applicable requirements of this Ordinance. The SSDP shall be used solely as a means to enforce compliance with the terms of this Ordinance, and shall not be considered an inducement for the approval of any application for development approval.
12.6.7.3 DURATION.
12.6.7.3.1 Upon approval of a Site Specific Development Plan, the right to develop such Development or Use shall continue for a period of two (2) years from the date of approval of such Site Specific Development Plan.
12.6.7.3.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the County of Lee, in its approval, may authorize a Vested Rights development period of longer than two (2) years, but in no event longer than
Article 12
Unified Development Ordinance 12- 9
five (5) years, if, in the County of Lees sole discretion, such longer period is necessary because of the size and phasing of the Development, the investment in the Development, the need for the Development, economic cycles, and such other conditions as the County of Lee may consider relevant.
12.6.7.4 APPLICATION.
12.6.7.4.1 An application for an SSDP may be made to the Department of Community Development in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. Application may be made by the landowner. If made by the holder of an equitable interest, the application shall be accompanied by a verified title report and by a notarized statement of consent to proceed with the proposed SSDP executed by the landowner. Application may be made by the Planning Board or the Governing Body. If made by the Planning Board or the Governing Body, the applicant shall obtain and attach a notarized statement of consent to proceed with the proposed SSDP executed by the owner of the subject property.
12.6.7.4.2 It is the intent of these regulations that the application for an SSDP will be made and considered simultaneously with the review of other necessary applications; including, but not limited to, land-use approval designation as may be utilized by the County of Lee. If combined with an application for rezoning, subdivision and plat approval, planned development or Special Use permit, the application for a SSDP shall be submitted with said application and shall be processed, to the maximum extent possible, jointly to avoid duplication of hearings and repetition of information. A SSDP is not a substitute for, nor an alternative to, any other required permit or approval, and the applicant must comply with all other required procedures for development approval.
12.6.7.4.3 The provisions of this Section supplement, but do not replace, any additional information required by Appendix B for any site plan, Planned Unit Development plan, a TND application, a subdivision plat, a Special Use permit, a Conditional Use District zoning plan, or any other application for development approval required for the proposed development.
12.6.7.5 APPROVAL.
No SSDP shall become effective until approved by the Governing Body. What constitutes a site specific development plan under this section that would trigger a vested right shall be finally determined by the document that triggers such vesting shall be so identified at the time of its approval. The Governing Body shall consider the proposed SSDP consistent with any procedures as may be established pursuant to NCGS §§ 153A-344.1 and 160A-385.1. The Governing Body, in approving an SSDP, shall expressly find that the agreement meets those criteria in this Ordinance for approval of the Applications for Development Approval. The Governing Body may:
(a) Approve the SSDP;
(b) Approve the SSDP with conditions; or
(c) Reject the SSDP, in whole or in part, and take such further action as it deems to be in the public interest.
12.6.7.6 RECORDATION OF SSDP.
No later than ten (10) days after the Governing Body approves an SSDP, the Department of Community Development shall record a copy of the SSDP with the county register of deeds, and the recordation constitutes notice of the SSDP to all persons. The burdens of the SSDP are binding on, and the benefits of the SSDP inure to, the parties to the agreement and to all their successors in interest and assigns.
12.6.7.7 COVENANTS.
Unless otherwise provided in the SSDP, any covenant by the Governing Body contained in the SSDP to refrain from exercising any legislative, quasi- legislative, quasi-judicial or other discretionary power, including rezoning or the adoption of any rule or regulation that would affect the proposed subdivision, shall be limited to a period not exceeding that specified in NCGS §§ 153A-344.1(d)(1) and 160A-385.1(d)(1). The covenant shall also contain a proviso that the Governing Body may, without incurring any liability, engage in action that otherwise would constitute a breach of the covenant if it makes a determination on the record that the action is necessary to avoid a
Article 12
Unified Development Ordinance 12- 10
substantial risk of injury to public health, safety and general welfare. The covenant shall contain the additional provision that the Governing Body may, without incurring any liability, engage in action that otherwise would constitute a breach of the covenant if the action is required by federal or state law.
12.6.7.8 NOTICE OF DECISION.
Within ten (10) days following a decision of an SSDP, the Department of Community Development shall give notice of such action to the applicant.
12.6.7.9 THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in the SSDP, the SSDP shall create no rights enforceable by any party who/which is not a party to the SSDP.
12.6.7.10 AMENDMENT OR CANCELLATION.
A SSDP may be amended, or cancelled in whole or in part, by mutual consent of the parties to the SSDP or by their successors in interest or assigns.
12.6.8 PHASED DEVELOPMENT PLANS (PDPs).
The procedures and requirements pertaining to Phased Development Plans (PDPs) shall be the same as those set forth for SSDPs in § 12.6.7, except as provided below:
12.6.8.1 DURATION.
The Governing Body may, but under no circumstances is it required, provide by ordinance that approval by the Governing Body of a phased development plan shall vest the zoning classification or classifications so approved for a period not to exceed five years.
12.6.8.2 PROCEDURE.
The document that triggers such vesting shall be so identified at the time of its approval. The Governing Body still may require the landowner to submit a site specific development plan for approval by the County of Lee with respect to each phase or phases in order to obtain final approval to develop within the restrictions of the vested zoning classification or classifications.
12.6.8.3 DISCRETION.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the Governing Body to confer vested rights upon a proposed site specific development plan.
Article 12
Unified Development Ordinance 12- 11
12.7 EXPIRATION OF DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS.
12.7.1 TIME LIMITS ON APPROVALS.
12.7.1.1 Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this Ordinance, development permits shall automatically expire and become null and void, and all activities taken pursuant to such development application shall cease and become null and void, and all activities pursuant to such approval thereafter shall be deemed in violation of this Ordinance, when:
 the applicant fails to satisfy any condition that was imposed as part of the original or revised approval of the application for development approval, or that was made pursuant to the terms of any development agreement, including the failure to abide by specified time limits established therein; or
 the applicant fails to present a subsequent development application as required by this title within the time so required or as may be required by Articles 4 and 5 of this Ordinance or North Carolina law.
12.7.1.2 If no time limit for satisfaction of conditions is specified in the original or revised approval of the development application, the time shall be presumed to be twelve (12) months from the date of approval.
12.7.1.3 DATE FROM WHICH TIME LIMIT IS MEASURED.
Each time period referenced in Articles 4 and 5 relating to the scope of a Development Permit shall run from the final action of the appropriate official, officer, board, commission or the governing body with valid and legal jurisdiction to take such action or to approve such plans or to issue such permits. Except as may be otherwise indicated herein, the date of final action shall be the date such action was taken or such approval was granted or such permit was issued, as set forth on such action, approval or permit.
12.7.1.4 ANNOTATION OF DATES.
In order to assure that all applicants for actions, approvals or permits are informed of the applicable time limit, the date of final action and the expiration date shall be shown on each such action, permit or approval; but provided, however, that the Department of Community Development's failure to include either the date of final action or the expiration date shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such dates nor shall it be the basis of any action by the applicant to challenge the applicable expiration date. The burden is on the applicant to know the date of issuance and the expiration date. If either or both of such dates are not shown, the applicant may request, and the Department of Community Development shall promptly supply such date or dates.
12.7.1.5 EXPIRATION OF PERMITS.
All actions, approvals or permits shall expire on the expiration date prescribed within the various sections of this Ordinance unless a valid extension has been granted on or before the expiration date as provided in § 12.7.1.7, below, or the specific section relating to such Development Permit.
12.7.1.6 EXTENSIONS OF TIME LIMITS.
Unless otherwise prohibited by North Carolina law or this Ordinance, the Department of Community Development may extend the time for expiration of a development permit or approval for a period not to exceed one (1) year from the date of the original decision granting approval, if the application for extension is made in writing within the original period of validity. Subsequent extensions may be made by the final approval body upon finding that conditions at the time of approval have not changed. There shall be no additional extensions of any time limits for actions, approvals or permits set forth herein, as of right. Any extensions must be expressly requested by the applicant, in writing, and approved by the appropriate official, officer, board, commission or the governing body which originally took the action, approved the plan or issued the permit. A request for an extension of an expiration date shall be made on a form provided by the Department of Community Development and shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, the following: the current date of
Article 12
Unified Development Ordinance 12- 12
expiration; the extension period requested, which shall be no longer than the original period of time granted; and the reason(s) that the applicant has been unable to proceed within the period of the original expiration date. Before granting an extension, the official, officer, board, commission or the governing body shall determine whether any applicable changes in land use regulations have occurred which would impose new requirements with respect to such action, approval or permit, if an extension were denied, and the applicant were compelled to re-file for an original action, approval or permit. If changes have occurred, the official, officer, board, commission or the governing body shall balance the burden imposed on the applicant if required to re-file for an original action, approval or permit against the benefit accruing to the public by requiring the applicant to comply with the new regulation.

Article 13
Unified Development Ordinance 13- 1
13.1 PURPOSE.
13.1.1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
13.1.1.1 Municipal: The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3, 5, and 8 of Article 19 of Chapter 160A; and Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental the responsibility units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
13.1.1.2 County: The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3 and 4 of Article 18 of Chapter 153A; and Part 121, Article 6 of Chapter 153A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
13.1.2 FINDINGS OF FACT
13.1.2.1 The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Sanford, the Town of Broadway and the County of Lee are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
13.1.2.2 These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
13.1.3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to: restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and
prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
13.1.4 OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this ordinance are:
to protect human life and health;
to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
to minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;
to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas; and
to ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area.

13.8.4 STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAINS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS.
13.8.4.1 Within the Special Flood Hazard Areas designated as Approximate Zone A and established in Section 13.3.2, where no Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the following provisions, in addition to Sections 13.8.1 and 13.8.2, shall apply:
13.8.4.1.1 No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of twenty (20) feet each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream, whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
13.8.4.1.2 The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be determined based on one of the following criteria set in priority order:
(a) If Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this ordinance and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in Sections 13.5.1 (k) and (l).
(b) All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development proposals shall provide Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data if development is greater than five (5) acres or has more than fifty (50) lots/manufactured home sites. Such Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference per Section 13.3.2 to be utilized in implementing this ordinance.
(c) When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is not available from a Federal, State, or other source as outlined above, the reference level
Article 13
Unified Development Ordinance 13- 20
shall be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in Section 13.2.

13.8.5 STANDARDS FOR RIVERINE FLOODPLAINS WITH BFE, BUT WITHOUT ESTABLISHED FLOODWAYS OR NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
Along rivers and streams where BFE data is provided but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are identified for a Special Flood Hazard Area on the FIRM or in the FIS report, the following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas:
(a) Standards outlined in Sections 13.8.1 and 13.8.2; and
(b) Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.
13.8.6 FLOODWAYS AND NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Section 13.3.2. The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in Sections 13.8.1 and 13.8.2, shall apply to all development within such areas:
(a) No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated that:
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice and presented to the floodplain administrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit, or
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion of the proposed encroachment.
(b) If Section 13.8.6(a) is satisfied, all development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this ordinance.

Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Section 13.3.2, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to Section 13.8.1, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the following requirements:
(a) The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM); or at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
(b) Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be floodproofed to the same level as required in 13.9.3(a) so that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
Article 13

The service radius for a neighborhood park is 1/2 to one mile and is easily accessible to the neighborhood population through safe walking and biking access. Parking may or may not be required. Where feasible the activity areas are equally divided between quiet/passive activities and active play. This type of park may be developed as a school/park or community center facility.
PARK, REGIONAL
A regional park is a park within a fifty mile service radius, which serves several communities or a multi-county region.
