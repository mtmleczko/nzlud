PREFACE 
    This Code is a codification of the ordinances of Burlington, North Carolina of a general and permanent nature, as republished in 1988. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table appearing in the back of the volume, any ordinance included herein can be readily located in the Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1, is numbered 1-1 and the sixteenth section of Chapter 10 is 10-16. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2 and 4-4.3 respectively. New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number; e.g., if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officers and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he or she is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised pages are received, it will become the responsibility of the holder to have them inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such pages be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Sec. 2-225. - Records. 
(a)  The human resources director shall retain records necessary to the proper administration of the personnel system. 
(b)  As stated in Chapter 160A of the General Statutes of North Carolina, personnel records maintained by a city are subject to inspection. Personnel records shall be inspected in accordance with the following statute: 
    Section 160-A-168. Privacy of employee personnel records. 
    (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of G.S. 132-6 or any other general law or local act concerning access to public records, personnel files of employees, former employees, or applicants for employment maintained by a city are subject to inspection and may be disclosed only as provided by this section. For purposes of this section, an employee's personnel file consists of any information in any form gathered by the city with respect to that employee and, by way of illustration but not limitation, relating to his application, selection or nonselection, performance, promotions, demotions, transfers, suspension and other disciplinary actions, evaluation forms, leave, salary, and termination of employment. As used in this section, "employee" includes former employees of the city. 
    (b) The following information with respect to each city employee is a matter of public record: Name; age; date of original employment or appointment to the service; current position title; current salary; date and amount of the most recent increase or decrease in salary; date of the most recent promotion, demotion, transfer, suspension, separation, or other change in position classification; and the office to which the employee is currently assigned. The city council shall determine in what form and by whom this information will be maintained. Any person may have access to this information for the purpose of inspection, examination, and copying, during regular business hours, subject only to such rules and regulations for the safekeeping of public records as the city council may have adopted. Any person denied access to this information may apply to the appropriate division of the general court of justice for an order compelling disclosure, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders. 
    (c) All information contained in a city employee's personnel file, other than the information made public by subsection (b) of this section, is confidential and shall be open to inspection only in the following instances: 
(1)  The employee or his duly authorized agent may examine all portions of his personnel file except: (i) letters of reference solicited prior to employment, and (ii) information concerning a medical disability, mental or physical, that a prudent physician would not divulge to his patient.

However, the official having custody of such records may release the name, address, and telephone number from a personnel file for the purpose of assisting in a criminal investigation. 
(6)  An employee may sign a written release, to be placed with his personnel file, that permits the person with custody of the file to provide, either in person with custody of the file to provide, either in person, by telephone, or by mail, information specified in the release to prospective employers, educational institutions, or other persons specified in the release. 
(7)  The city manager, with concurrence of the council, or, in cities not having a manager, the council may inform any person of the employment or nonemployment, promotion, demotion, suspension or other disciplinary action, reinstatement, transfer, or termination of a city employee and the reasons for that personnel action. Before releasing the information, the manager or council shall determine in writing that the release is essential to maintaining public confidence in the administration of city services or to maintaining the level and quality of city services. This written determination shall be retained in the office of the manager or the city clerk, and is a record available for public inspection and shall become part of the employee's personnel file. 
    (c1) Even if considered part of an employee's personnel file, the following information need not be disclosed to an employee nor to any other person: 
(1)  Testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment, employment, or promotion in the city's service, when disclosure would compromise the objectivity or the fairness of the testing or examination process. 
(2)  Investigative reports or memoranda and other information concerning the investigation of possible criminal actions of an employee, until the investigation is completed and no criminal action taken, or until the criminal action is concluded. 
(3)  Information that might identify an undercover law enforcement officer or a law enforcement informer. 
(4)  Notes, preliminary drafts and internal communications concerning an employee. In the event such materials are used for any official personnel decision, then the employee or his duly authorized agent shall have a right to inspect such materials. 
    (c2) The city council may permit access, subject to limitations they may impose, to selected personnel files by a professional representative of a training, research, or academic institution if that person certifies that he will not release information identifying the employees whose files are opened and that the information will be used solely for statistical, research, or teaching purposes. This certification shall be retained by the city as long as each personnel file examined is retained. 
    (d) The city council of a city that maintains personnel files containing information other than the information mentioned in subsection (b) of this section shall establish procedures whereby an employee who objects to material in his file on grounds that it is inaccurate or misleading may seek to have the material removed from the file or may place in the file a statement relating to the material. 
    (e) A public official or employee who knowingly, willfully, and with malice permits any person to have access to information contained in a personnel file, except as is permitted by this section, is guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor and upon conviction shall only be fined in the discretion of the court but not in excess of five hundred dollars ($500.00). 
    (f) Any person, not specifically authorized by this section to have access to a personnel file designated as confidential, who shall knowingly and willfully examine in its official filing place, remove or copy any portion of a confidential personnel file shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor and upon conviction shall only be fined in the discretion of the court but not in excess of five hundred dollars ($500.00).

The plan standardizes titles, each of which is indicative of a definite range of duties and responsibilities of the same meaning throughout the classified service. 
Sec. 2-244. - Composition. 
    The classification plan shall consist of the following: 
(a)  Grouping of positions in classes which are approximately equal in difficulty and responsibility which call for the same general qualifications, and which can be equitably compensated within the same range of pay under similar working conditions. 
(b)  Class titles descriptive of the work of the class which identify the class. 
(c)  Written specifications for each class of positions. 
Sec. 2-245. - Use of class titles. 
    Class titles are to be used in all personnel, accounting, budget appropriation, and financial records. No person shall be appointed to or employed in a position in the classified service under a title not included in the classification plan. Other job titles may be used in the course of departmental routine to indicate authority, status in the organization, or administrative work. 
(Code 1959, § 2-28) 
Sec. 2-246. - Use of class specifications. 
    Specifications are to be interpreted in their entirety in relationship to others in the classification plan. Particular phrases or examples are not to be isolated and treated as a full definition of a class. Specifications are deemed to be descriptive and explanatory of the kind of work performed and not necessarily inclusive of all duties performed. 
Sec. 2-247. - Use of plan. 
    The classification plan shall be used as follows: 
(a)  As a guide in recruiting and examining applicants for employment; 
(b)  In determining salary to be paid for various types of work; 
(c)  In determining personal service items in departmental budgets; 
(d)  In determining lines of promotion and in development of employee training programs; and 
(e)  In providing uniform job terminology understandable by all officials and employees and by the general public. 
Sec. 2-248. - Administration of the plan. 
    The human resources director is charged with administration and maintenance of the classification plan so that it will accurately reflect the duties performed by employees in the classes to which their positions are allocated. It will be the human resources director's duty to examine the nature of the positions as they are created and to allocate them to existing classes or to create new classes as deemed appropriate; to recommend such changes in the classification plan as are made necessary by changes in the duties and responsibilities of existing positions; and periodically to review the entire classification plan so that the city manager may recommend appropriate changes in individual position allocations or in the classification plan to the city council. 
(Code 1959, § 2-30; Ord. No. 97-27, § 2, 6-17-97) 
Sec. 2-249. - Allocation of position. 
    When a new position is established or the duties of an existing position change, department heads shall submit in writing a comprehensive job description describing in detail the duties of such a position. The human resources director shall thereupon investigate the actual or suggested duties and recommend to the city manager the appropriate class allocation or the establishment of a new class. The city council shall then act upon such recommendations. 
(Code 1959, § 2-32; Ord. No. 97-27, § 2, 6-17-97) 
Sec. 2-250. - Request for reclassification. 
    Employees who consider their position improperly classified should first submit their request to their supervisor who shall review such request as to its justification and shall transmit a recommendation to the human resources director. The human resources director shall render a decision, advise the employee and make a recommendation to the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 97-27, § 2, 6-17-97)

    Flood Insurance Study (FIS) means an examination, evaluation, and determination of flood hazards, corresponding water surface elevations (if appropriate), flood hazard risk zones, and other flood data in a community issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Flood Insurance Study report includes Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs), if published. 
    Flood Prone Area. See "Floodplain." 
    Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. 
    Floodplain Administrator is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.

    Flood-resistant material means any building product [material, component or system] capable of withstanding direct and prolonged contact (minimum 72 hours) with floodwaters without sustaining damage that requires more than low-cost cosmetic repair. Any material that is water-soluble or is not resistant to alkali or acid in water, including normal adhesives for above-grade use, is not flood-resistant. Pressure-treated lumber or naturally decay-resistant lumbers are acceptable flooring materials. Sheet-type flooring coverings that restrict evaporation from below and materials that are impervious, but dimensionally unstable are not acceptable. Materials that absorb or retain water excessively after submergence are not flood-resistant. Please refer to Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements , and available from the FEMA. Class 4 and 5 materials, referenced therein, are acceptable flood-resistant materials. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot. 
    Floodway encroachment analysis means an engineering analysis of the impact that a proposed encroachment into a floodway or non-encroachment area is expected to have on the floodway boundaries and flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The evaluation shall be prepared by a qualified North Carolina licensed engineer using standard engineering methods and models. 
    Flood Zone means a geographical area shown on a Flood Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area. 
    Freeboard means the height added to the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) to account for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater that the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization on the watershed. The Base Flood Elevation plus the freeboard establishes the "Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation". 
    Functionally Dependent Facility means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.

Certified Local Government (CLG) Programs are approved by the US Department of the Interior in cooperation with the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources through the State Historic Preservation Officer as having met the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended in 1980. 
    Letter of Map Change (LOMC ) means an official determination issued by FEMA that amends or revises an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map or Flood Insurance Study. Letters of Map Change include: 
(a)  Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter, to an effective National Flood Insurance Program map. A LOMA is based on technical data showing that a property had been inadvertently mapped as being in the floodplain, but is actually on natural high ground above the base flood elevation. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property, portion of a property, or structure is not located in a special flood hazard area. 
(b)  Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, special flood hazard area boundaries and floodway delineations, and other planimetric features. 
(c)  Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F): A determination that a structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the BFE and is, therefore, no longer located within the special flood hazard area. In order to qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in accordance with the community's floodplain management regulations. 
(d)  Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map or Flood Insurance Study; upon submission and approval of certified as-built documentation, a Letter of Map Revision may be issued by FEMA to revise the effective FIRM. 
    Light Duty Truck means any motor vehicle rated at 8,500 pounds Gross Vehicular Weight Rating or less which has a vehicular curb weight of 6,000 pounds or less and which has a basic vehicle frontal area of 45 square feet or less as defined in 40 CFR 86.082-2 and is:

In "Special Flood Hazard Areas" where no BFE has been established, this elevation shall be at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
    Remedy a Violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with State and community floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing Federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Salvage Yard means any non-residential property used for the storage, collection, and/or recycling of any type of equipment, and including but not limited to vehicles, appliances and related machinery.

    Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) means the land in the floodplain subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of being flooded in any given year, as determined in Article 3, Section B of this ordinance. 
    Start of Construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, or a gas, liquid, or liquefied gas storage tank that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial Damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure during any one-year period whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. See definition of "substantial improvement". Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial Improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during any one-year period for which the cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(a)  Any correction of existing violations of State or community health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or, 
(b)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Technical Bulletin and Technical Fact Sheet means a FEMA publication that provides guidance concerning the building performance standards of the NFIP, which are contained in Title 44 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations at Section 60.3. The bulletins and fact sheets are intended for use primarily by State and local officials responsible for interpreting and enforcing NFIP regulations and by members of the development community, such as design professionals and builders. New bulletins, as well as updates of existing bulletins, are issued periodically as needed. The bulletins do not create regulations; rather they provide specific guidance for complying with the minimum requirements of existing NFIP regulations. 
    Temperature Controlled means having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or cooling system, built-in or appliance. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Articles 4 and 5 is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water Surface Elevation (WSE) means the height, in relation to mean sea level, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas. 
    Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

ARTICLE 3. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Section A. - Lands to which this ordinance applies. 
    This ordinance shall apply to all Special Flood Hazard Areas within the jurisdiction, including the Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction (ETJ) of the City of Burlington and within the jurisdiction of any other community whose governing body agrees, by resolution, to such applicability. 
(Ord. No. 2017-23, 9-19-17) 
Section B. - Basis for establishing the Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
    The Special Flood Hazard Areas are those identified under the Cooperating Technical State (CTS) agreement between the State of North Carolina and FEMA in its FIS dated November 17, 2017, developed as part of the FIS, which are adopted by reference and declared a part of this ordinance. Future revisions to the FIS and DFIRM panels that do not change flood hazard data within the jurisdictional authority of the City of Burlington are also adopted by reference and declared a part of this ordinance. Subsequent Letter of Map Revisions (LOMRs) and/or Physical Map Revisions (PMRs) shall be adopted within 3 months. 
(Ord. No. 2017-23, 9-19-17) 
Section 1.24. - Extension of city boundaries: Upon petition by 150 voters of city or of area proposed to be annexed. 
    Whenever a petition requesting an extension of the corporate limits of the City of Burlington and describing with reasonable certainty the territory proposed to be annexed to the city, which petition shall be signed by at least one hundred and fifty (150) qualified voters of the City of Burlington of the territory proposed to be annexed or both, shall be presented to the city council as it appears advisable and for the best interest of said city and also for the best interest of the citizens of the territory proposed to be annexed, then the city council may, in its discretion, pass an ordinance extending the corporate limits of the city as requested by said petition. 
Section 1.25. - Same: Form of petition; annexation ordinance. 
(a)  The said petition shall be in writing and the residence address of each signer shall be written after his signature. Each signature to the petition shall be verified by a statement (which may relate to a specified number of signatures) made by said adult, resident freeholder of the City of Burlington or the territory proposed to be annexed, under oath, before an officer competent to administer oaths, to the effect that the signature was made in his presence and is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. The petition need not be all on one sheet nor in one folder or volume, but if more than one sheet, it shall be verified as to each sheet, and if in separate folders or volumes, each folder or volume shall contain a copy of the petition and shall be verified as to each sheet contained therein. The city clerk shall investigate the sufficiency of the petition and present it to the city council with a certificate stating the result of his investigation. The city council shall thereupon determine the sufficiency of the petition and its determination shall be conclusive.

SECTION 4: - MAINTENANCE 

4-401 - General Standards for Maintenance 
(A)  Function of BMPs As Intended. The owner of each structural BMP installed pursuant to this ordinance shall maintain and operate it so as to preserve and continue its function in controlling stormwater quality and quantity at the degree or amount of function for which the structural BMP was designed. 
(B)  Annual Maintenance Inspection and Report. The person responsible for maintenance of any structural BMP installed pursuant to this ordinance shall submit to the Stormwater Administrator an inspection report from one of the following persons performing services only in their area of competence: a qualified registered North Carolina professional engineer, surveyor, landscape architect, soil scientist, aquatic biologist, or person certified by the North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service for stormwater treatment practice inspection and maintenance. The inspection report shall contain all of the following: 
(1)  The name, address and telephone number of the landowner; 
(2)  The recorded book and page number and the Parcel Identification Number (PIN) or Parcel Number as assigned by Alamance County or Guilford County respectively of the lot of each structural BMP; 
(3)  A statement that an inspection was made of all structural BMPs; 
(4)  The date the inspection was made; 
(5)  A statement that all inspected structural BMPs are performing properly and are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the approved maintenance agreement required by this ordinance; and 
(6)  The original signature and seal of the engineer, surveyor, or landscape architect. 
All inspection reports shall be on forms supplied by the Stormwater Administrator. An original inspection report shall be provided to the Stormwater Administrator beginning one year from the date of as-built certification and each year thereafter on or before the date of the as-built certification. 
4-402 - Operation and Maintenance Agreement 
(A)  In General. Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or building site to be served by a structural BMP pursuant to this ordinance, and prior to issuance of any permit for development or redevelopment requiring a structural BMP pursuant to this ordinance, the applicant or owner of the site must execute an operation and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of the site, portions of the site, and lots or parcels served by the structural BMP. Until the transference of all property, sites, or lots served by the structural BMP, the original owner or applicant shall have primary responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the maintenance agreement. 
The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner or owners to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the structural BMP, and shall state the terms, conditions, and schedule of maintenance for the structural BMP. In addition, it shall grant to the City of Burlington a right of entry in the event that the Stormwater Administrator has reason to believe it has become necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the structural BMP; however, in no case shall the right of entry, of itself, confer an obligation on the City of Burlington to assume responsibility for the structural BMP. 
The operation and maintenance agreement must be approved by the Stormwater Administrator prior to plan approval, and it shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with the county Register of Deeds upon final plat approval. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall be given to the Stormwater Administrator within fourteen (14) days following its recordation. 
(B)  Special Requirement for Homeowners' and Other Associations. For all structural BMPs required pursuant to this ordinance and that are to be or are owned and maintained by a homeowners' association, property owners' association, or similar entity, the required operation and maintenance agreement shall include all of the following provisions: 
(1)  Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously operate and maintain the stormwater control and management facilities. 
(2)  Establishment of an escrow account, which can be spent solely for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, or reconstruction of the structural BMPs. If structural BMPs are not performing adequately or as intended or are not properly maintained, the City of Burlington, in its sole discretion, may remedy the situation, and in such instances the City of Burlington shall be fully reimbursed from the escrow account. Escrowed funds may be spent by the association for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, and reconstruction of the structural BMPs, provided that the City of Burlington shall first consent to the expenditure. 
(3)  The escrow account shall be funded to a level suitable to conduct the activities listed in Section 4-402(B)(2), which shall be based upon a submittal of construction costs and anticipated maintenance costs prepared and sealed by the design professional, and approved by the City of Burlington. Both developer contribution and annual sinking funds shall fund the escrow account. Prior to plat recordation or issuance of construction permits, whichever shall first occur, the developer shall pay into the escrow account an amount equal to fifteen (15) per cent of the initial construction cost of the structural BMPs. Two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the total amount of sinking fund budget shall be deposited into the escrow account within the first five (5) years and the full amount shall be deposited within ten (10) years following initial construction of the structural BMPs. Funds shall be deposited each year into the escrow account. A portion of the annual assessments of the association shall include an allocation into the escrow account. Any funds drawn down from the escrow account shall be replaced in accordance with the schedule of anticipated work used to create the sinking fund budget. 
(4)  The percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to fund the escrow account may be varied by the City of Burlington depending on the design and materials of the stormwater control and management facility. 
(5)  Granting to the City of Burlington a right of entry to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, and reconstruct structural BMPs. 
(6)  Allowing the City of Burlington to recover from the association and its member's any and all costs the City of Burlington expends to maintain or repair the structural BMPs or to correct any operational deficiencies. Failure to pay the City of Burlington all of its expended costs, after forty-five days written notice, shall constitute a breach of the agreement. In case of a deficiency, the City of Burlington shall thereafter be entitled to bring an action against the association and its members to pay, or foreclose upon the lien hereby authorized by the agreement against the property, or both. Interest, collection costs, and attorney fees shall be added to the recovery. 
(7)  A statement that this agreement shall not obligate the City of Burlington to maintain or repair any structural BMPs, and the City of Burlington shall not be liable to any person for the condition or operation of structural BMPs. 
(8)  A statement that this agreement shall not in any way diminish, limit, or restrict the right of the City of Burlington to enforce any of its ordinances as authorized by law. 
(9)  A provision indemnifying and holding harmless the City of Burlington for any costs and injuries arising from or related to the structural BMP, unless the City of Burlington has agreed in writing to assume the maintenance responsibility for the BMP and has accepted dedication of any and all rights necessary to carry out that maintenance. 
4-403 - Inspection Program 
    Inspections and inspection programs by the City of Burlington may be conducted or established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to, reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in BMPs; and evaluating the condition of BMPs. 
    If the owner or occupant of any property refuses to permit such inspection, the Stormwater Administrator shall proceed to obtain an administrative search warrant pursuant to G.S. 15-27.2 or its successor. No person shall obstruct, hamper or interfere with the Stormwater Administrator while carrying out his or her official duties. 
4-404 - Performance Security for Installation and Maintenance 
(A)  May Be Required. The City of Burlington may, at its discretion, require the submittal of a performance security or bond with surety, cash escrow, irrevocable letter of credit or other acceptable legal arrangement prior to issuance of a permit in order to ensure that the structural BMPs are 
(1)  installed by the permit holder as required by the approved stormwater management plan, and/or 
(2)  maintained by the owner as required by the operation and maintenance agreement. 
(B)  Amount. 
(1)  Installation. The amount of an installation performance security shall be the total estimated construction cost of the BMPs approved under the permit, plus 25%. The estimate of construction cost shall be prepared by a qualified registered North Carolina Professional Engineer, Surveyor, Soil Scientist, or Landscape Architect. 
(2)  Maintenance. The amount of a maintenance performance security shall be the present value of an annuity of perpetual duration based on a reasonable estimate of the annual cost of inspection, operation and maintenance of the BMPs approved under the permit, at a discount rate that reflects the jurisdiction's cost of borrowing minus a reasonable estimate of long term inflation. 
(C)  Uses of Performance Security. 
(1)  Forfeiture Provisions. The performance security shall contain forfeiture provisions for failure, after proper notice, to complete work within the time specified, or to initiate or maintain any actions which may be required of the applicant or owner in accordance with this ordinance, approvals issued pursuant to this ordinance, or an operation and maintenance agreement established pursuant to this ordinance. 
(2)  Default. Upon default of the owner to construct, maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct any structural BMP in accordance with the applicable permit or operation and maintenance agreement, the Stormwater Administrator shall obtain and use all or any portion of the security to make necessary improvements based on an engineering estimate. Such expenditure of funds shall only be made after requesting the owner to comply with the permit or maintenance agreement. In the event of a default triggering the use of installation performance security, the City of Burlington shall not return any of the unused deposited cash funds or other security, which shall be retained for maintenance. 
(3)  Costs in Excess of Performance Security. If the City of Burlington takes action upon such failure by the applicant or owner, the City of Burlington may collect from the applicant or owner the difference between the amount of the reasonable cost of such action and the amount of the security held, in addition to any other penalties or damages due. 
(4)  Refund. Within sixty days of the final approval, the installation performance security shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated, except any amount attributable to the cost (plus 25%) of landscaping installation and ongoing maintenance associated with the BMPs covered by the security. Any such landscaping shall be inspected one (1) year after installation with replacement for compliance with the approved plans and specifications and, if in compliance, the portion of the financial security attributable to landscaping shall be released. 
4-405 - Notice to owners 
(A)  Deed Recordation and Indications On Plat. The applicable operations and maintenance agreement pertaining to every structural BMP shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with the county Register of Deeds upon final plat approval. If no subdivision plat is recorded for the site, then the operations and maintenance agreement, shall be recorded with the county Register of Deeds so as to appear in the chain of title of all subsequent purchasers under generally accepted searching principles. 
(B)  Signage. Where appropriate in the determination of the Stormwater Administrator to assure compliance with this ordinance, structural BMPs shall be posted with a conspicuous sign stating who is responsible for required maintenance and annual inspection. The sign shall be maintained so as to remain visible and legible. 
4-406 - Records of Installation and Maintenance Activities 
    The owner of each structural BMP shall keep records of inspections, maintenance, and repairs for at least five years from the date of creation of the record and shall submit the same upon reasonable request to the Stormwater Administrator. 
4-407 - Nuisance 
    The owner of each stormwater BMP, whether structural or nonstructural BMP, shall maintain it so as not to create or result in a nuisance condition. 
4-408 - Maintenance Easement 
    Every structural BMP installed pursuant to this ordinance shall be made accessible for adequate maintenance and repair by a maintenance easement. The easement shall be recorded and its terms shall specify who may make use of the easement and for what purposes. Dedicated access and/or maintenance easements for structural BMPs on private property are for the use of the owner of the structural BMP(s). Dedication of access and/or maintenance easements for structural BMPs in no way binds or requires the City of Burlington to perform maintenance on structural BMPs on private property. 
4-409 - Existing Structural BMPs 
    Sections 4-401, 4-403, 4-404, 4-405(B), 4-406 and 4-407 of this Ordinance shall also apply to structural BMPs that were installed prior to the effective date of this ordinance.

(Ord. No. 2001-38, § 6, 12-18-2001)  
Sec. 2-279. - Military leave policy for call-up to active duty. 
(a)  General. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) governs the rights of employees who temporarily leave their jobs as a result of their voluntary or involuntary service in the United States uniformed services. 
(1)  Reemployment eligibility and duration of service. Under USERRA, all employees are eligible for a military leave of absence of up to five (5) years as specified below, provided that the employee gives advance verbal or written notice of the leave except when such notice is precluded by military necessity, impossibility, or unreasonableness. This five-year period is cumulative over the course of employment and may be extended in certain situations, such as war or national emergency declared by the President or Congress. USERRA protects only employees who are honorably discharged and who return to their jobs following periods of uniformed services of no longer than five (5) years. 
(2)  Types of military leave. Uniformed services consist of the following: Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard, Army Reserve, Naval Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Air Force Reserve, or Coast Guard Reserve, Army National Guard or Air National Guard, Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service or any other category of persons designated by the President in time of war or emergency. 
(3)  Types of service covered. Active duty, active duty in training, initial active duty for training, inactive duty training, full-time National Guard duty, absence from work for an examination to determine a person's fitness for any of the above types of duty and funeral honors duty performed by National Guard or reserve members. 
(b)  Employee's obligation to employer. The law requires all employees to provide their employer with advance notice (either written or oral) of military service unless prevented by military necessity. It may be provided by the employee or by an appropriate officer of the branch of the military in which the employee will be serving. 
(c)  Employer's obligation and effect on employee benefits. Employees who take a military leave of absence also are entitled to: 
(1)  Retain and accrue benefits based on the number of years including time spent in active military service such as longevity pay, market adjustments, and vacation/sick leave; 
(2)  Elect and pay for continued health care coverage during their absence as outlined below; and 
(3)  Participate during the leave in benefits provided through the North Carolina Local Government Retirement System. 
(d)  Employees may continue health and dental coverage for themselves and/or their families with their civilian employer while on military leave. While dependents do not have an independent right to continue coverage under USERRA, the employee has the right to continue coverage for him/herself and covered dependents. Health coverage is available through the military to all active military personnel and their families, which begins immediately upon activation. A city employee granted military leave may elect to receive insurance coverage as outlined below: 
(1)  Option one: The employee may elect to continue health and/or dental coverage through the city. The city will continue to pay the employer portion of medical and dental premiums until their return from active military leave. The employee is obligated to pay the employee portion on a monthly basis; payments are due on the first of each month. There is a thirty-day grace period for payment of premiums. Failure to remit payment in a timely manner will result in termination of coverage. The coverage provided by the military will also be in effect as of the activation date (into military service) for the employee and dependents (unless coverage is declined for dependents). 
(2)  Option two: The employee may elect to cancel health and/or dental coverage through the city as coverage is provided to all active military personnel and their families. Employees may re-enroll in the city's plans when they return to active employment status. Employees and their dependents will be reinstated with health and dental benefits immediately with no pre-existing conditions or waiting periods (waiting periods and pre-existing conditions will apply if incurred as a result of military service). 
(e)  Retirement contributions by the employer. Employees who return following a period of military service are entitled to any pension benefits that accrued prior to departure, and any additional benefits that would have accrued with reasonable certainty during the employee's absence (i.e. retirement and 401(k) employer portions). Employees cannot be treated as inactive participants and cannot be treated as having incurred a break in service as a result of their absence from employment. 
For employees who are scheduled to be absent for military service ninety (90) or fewer days, the city will make "employer" contributions to 401(k) upon their return. 
For employees who are scheduled to be absent for military service ninety-one (91) or more days, the city will postpone making retroactive 401(k) contributions until the person submits satisfactory documentation. 
Presentation of the DD-214, Report of Separation, identifying the veteran's condition of discharge will enable their months of military service to be counted toward their retirement by the North Carolina Local Government Retirement System. 
(f)  401(k) contributions by the employee. Upon return to work, the employee may make contributions to the plan in the amount equal to the contributions that would have been made if the employee has been actively employed during the period of military service. The employee may make up missed contributions over three (3) times the period of time away (i.e. if an employee is out for twelve (12) months, he would have thirty-six (36) months to pay their missed employee contributions). 
(g)  Flex plan contributions by the employee. Contributions to the city's flexible spending plan (Beneflex) may be continued during military leave if a participating employee wishes to do so, provided that the pay differential (see below) is adequate to allow such participation. Otherwise, military leave would meet the requirements of a qualifying event to allow the participant to cease contributions until return from military service. 
(h)  Pay for leave. An employee granted temporary military leave for active-duty training, inactive-duty training, or extended military leave is granted a military pay differential. 
The pay differential is the amount, if any, by which the employee's normal base pay exceeds any pay received for such military training duty for the same period, including all military pay except subsistence allowance (including "quarters allowance") and travel allowance. 
Upon return from military duty, employees submit to the human resources director a copy of their original duty orders and a certified statement of their military pay and allowances for the appropriate period. Any adjustments in salary will be reflected in a subsequent paycheck. 
(i)  Reinstatement. The city will reinstate the veteran to the position he would have held if employment had not been interrupted by military service. 
In order to be eligible for reinstatement, the returning veteran must notify the city that he intends to return to employment once military service is completed. The length of time that the veteran has to contact the employer regarding reemployment depends on the length of the service as follows: 
(1)  Service of one (1) to thirty (30) days. The employee must report back to work by the beginning of the first regularly scheduled work day that would fall eight (8) hours after the end of the last calendar day of active military service. If, due to no fault of the employee, timely reporting back to work would be impossible or unreasonable, the employee must report back to work as soon as possible. 
(2)  Service of thirty-one (31) to one hundred eighty (180) days. A request for reinstatement must be submitted no later than fourteen (14) days after completion of an employee's service. If submission of a timely request is impossible or unreasonable through no fault of the employee the request must be submitted as soon as possible. If the fourteenth day falls on a day when offices are not open, the time extends to the next business day. 
(3)  Service of one hundred eighty-one (181) or more days. A request for reinstatement must be submitted no later than ninety (90) days after completion of an employee's military service. If the ninetieth day falls on a day when the offices are not open, the time extends to the next business day. 
(4)  Disability incurred or aggravated. The "reporting back to work" deadlines are extended for up to two (2) years for employees who are hospitalized or convalescing because of a disability incurred or aggravated during the period of military service. The two-year period will be extended by the minimum time required to accommodate a circumstance beyond an employee's control that would make reporting within the two-year period impossible or unreasonable. The employee is required to notify the city within the time limits set forth above even if extensions are necessary. 
(5)  Unexcused delay. An employee's reinstatement rights are not forfeited if the employee fails to report to work or to apply for reinstatement within the required time limits, but the employee will then be subject to the employer's rules governing unexcused absences. 
(j)  Documentation upon return. The city has the right to request that an employee who is absent for a period of military service of thirty-one (31) days or more provide documentation showing that: 
(1)  The employee's application for reinstatement is timely; 
(2)  The employee has not exceeded the five-year service limitation (some exceptions apply); and/or 
(3)  The employee's separation from service was not less than "honorable". 
Presentation of the DD-214, Report of Separation, identifying the veteran's condition of discharge will be considered as proof upon return. 
(k)  Protection against discharge without cause upon return. USERRA also protects returning veterans from discharge without cause for a period of time after reemployment. For example, if the returning veteran's military service lasted between thirty-one (31) and one hundred eighty (180) days, the veteran may not be terminated without cause for one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of reemployment. If the veteran's service was more than one hundred eighty (180) days, this protection applies for one (1) year after reemployment. Employees with less than thirty-one (31) days of service do not have protection against discharge without cause, but like other returning veterans, they are protected from discrimination based on military service or a continuing service obligation. 
(l)  Accumulation of vacation/sick leave while on active duty. Employees called to active military duty will continue to accumulate vacation and sick leave while in active military service.

In no event shall one member of a family either directly or indirectly attempt to influence and/or become involved in influencing another family member's salary, employment or termination, promotion or demotion and other terms and conditions of employment; and if an employee violates this provision, it shall be grounds for disciplinary action including dismissal. 
(b)  Where two (2) persons previously employed by the city become members of the same immediate family by virtue of marriage after the employment of each of them, this shall not be grounds for termination of either or both of them. Provided however, the department head of such employees shall make every reasonable effort to transfer one (1) of the persons to a similar job classification within another department. If this cannot be done, the department shall make every effort to insure that said persons work as separately as possible within said department and shall attempt to place them on different shifts if said department works on different shifts, provided however, in no event shall either of any such employees directly supervise the other member of the same immediate family.

(Ord. No. 79-61, § 1, 12-4-79; Ord. No. 79-62, § 1, 12-4-79)  
Sec. 2-323. - Reduction in force. 
(a)  Purpose. A reduction in force may become necessary due to economic circumstances, program elimination or alternation, shortage of work or funds, or privatization of existing programs. 
(b)  ProceduresDetermination of reductions. The city manager shall specify that there is a need to reduce the workforce and will determine if there is a need to reduce overall city positions or if the reduction will be limited to specific positions. If only specific positions are involved, the city manager, after consultation with department heads, shall determine the class/classes or functional area(s) and number of positions involved. The identification of employees subjected to the workforce reduction will be based (in priority of order) on: 
(1)  Possession of appropriate or applicable certifications; 
(2)  The organization's need for the employee's services and skills; 
(3)  The quality of the employee's past performance and past conduct; and 
(4)  Seniority in the position. 
Based on the above criteria, the department head shall develop a written rationale for the proposed reductions and changes in positions and personnel and present it to the human resource director and city manager. 
(c)  Notice of requirements. Employees who are subject to the reduction in force shall be given at least thirty (30) days' written notice prior to termination. 
(d)  Privatization efforts. The city will use its best efforts to encourage the private contractor, in the event city positions are eliminated due to privatization, to hire qualified city employees whose positions have been eliminated. 
(e)  Reduction in force assistance and outplacement services. The city will take the following steps to assist employees who are subjected to the reduction in force to locate other employment within the city: 
(1)  The city will attempt to locate alternate city employment for affected employees whose past performance has met minimum performance requirements. Where possible employees whose performance is in good standing and who occupy positions that have been identified for elimination will be given preference in consideration for existing city vacancies. This will take the form of having an opportunity to interview for such vacancies, if basic qualifications are met, without competition from other potential applicants, except other employees affected by the reduction in force. Affected employees must cooperate fully with human resources and the hiring department in the placement process to continue to be considered. Pay decisions regarding transfer, demotion, and promotion will be in accordance with the city's pay plan. 
(2)  The city may provide appropriate outplacement services either internally or through an outside agency. Services could include: 
a.  Career counseling; 
b.  Resume and application preparation; 
c.  Allowances for reasonable time off for interviews and employment follow-up; 
d.  Reasonable office support and telephone access to use for the job search; and 
e.  Access to listing or referrals of other employment opportunities. 
(f)  Severance pay. Employees whose position are being eliminated under a reduction in force will be eligible for seniority-based payment if all of the following conditions are met: 
(1)  The employee has not refused reasonable alternative employment with the city. 
(2)  The employee has not refused reasonable employment offers with a contractor (in the event of privatization). A reasonable employment offer shall be defined as one in which the employment offer does not result in a permanent reduction in the rate of pay of more than twenty (20) percent. 
(3)  The employee has not or is ineligible to submit notice of retirement to the North Carolina Local Government Retirement System. 
(4)  All financial obligations to the city must be current or satisfied in accordance with all applicable terms. 
Severance pay will be paid in the last check of employment and will not be subject to employee or employer retirement contributions. As a result, severance pay will not be included in computing the average final compensation for retirement purposes. Any period covered by severance pay will not be counted as an active employment period for the purposes of earning retirement service credit or for qualifying for employer-paid insurance coverage. Severance pay is based on total years of service with the City of Burlington; however, affected employees will not receive credit for any evaluation period that their performance was rated at "needs improvement." 
Less than 1 year 	2 weeks base pay equivalent 
1 but less than 5 years 	4 weeks base pay equivalent 
5 but less than 10 years 	6 weeks base pay equivalent 
10 but less than 15 years 	8 weeks base pay equivalent 
15 but less than 20 years 	10 weeks base pay equivalent 
20 years or more 	12 weeks base pay equivalent 
 
  
(g)  Benefits. Employees who receive severance pay shall be eligible for continuation of insurance coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) as amended, at the employee's expense. The city's portion of employee health insurance shall be paid for the corresponding number of weeks for which the employee received severance pay. Employees who retire with full or early retirement may be eligible for retiree health benefits as provided by the City of Burlington. Tuition reimbursement for courses previously submitted and approved will be honored by the city upon submission of proper documentation required by the tuition reimbursement policy. Affected employees may continue to use access services offered through the Employee Assistance and Counseling Program for up to one (1) year after termination. No other benefits will apply after termination of employment. 
(h)  Reinstatement. An employee who has been subjected to a reduction of force may be considered for internal job listings for a period of two (2) years. However, an employee who has elected to receive severance pay will not be eligible for re-employment with the City of Burlington for the number of weeks calculated in the severance payout unless repayment is made in advance of re-employment for any severance payout received in excess of the period of actual separation from the city. Employees who apply and are rehired within two (2) years shall have their sick accrual balance reinstated. 
(i)  Supplemental measures and changes to policy. This policy can be amended or revoked without notice to employees. Also, in order to possibly prevent or minimize the impact of a reduction in force, the city manager, at his/her discretion, may implement creative measures such as reducing work schedules, temporary reassignment of employees, or other such measures as deemed appropriate.

In the event the grantee fails or refuses to remove its property or satisfactorily restore all areas to the condition in which they existed prior to the original construction of the system, the city, at its sole option, may perform such work and collect the actual, documented, and reasonable cost thereof from the grantee.

Sec. 30-16. - No waiver of rights.

Nor shall title to the utility, legal or equitable, or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any Person without the prior written consent of the city and such consent shall not be unreasonably denied, withheld, or delayed and then only under such conditions as the city may in its sole discretion reasonably establish. Except that no consent shall be required for any sale, transfer, or assignment of ownership or control to an entity under common control with grantee, or by merger or consolidation, provided that prior to such transfer, the grantee provides to the city audited, verifiable information to establish that such transferee is under common control and has the financial, legal and technical ability to continue to fully perform all of the grantee's obligations under the city public rights-of-way agreement.

The word "control" as used herein means actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the disposal by the grantee, directly or indirectly, by gift, assignment, voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of ownership interest of grantee to an unaffiliated party or person which results in a material change of the composition of its board of directors and executive level management. Except that no consent shall be required for any sale, transfer, or assignment of ownership or control to an entity under common control with grantee, provided that prior to such transfer, grantee provides to the city audited, verifiable information to establish that such transferee under common control has the financial, legal and technical ability to continue to fully perform all of the grantee's obligations under the city public rights-of-way agreement. 
(c)  City approval. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the city public rights-of-way agreement subject to cancellation unless and until the city in its reasonable discretion shall have consented in writing thereto; however, such written consent shall not be unreasonably denied, withheld or delayed. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the city may inquire into the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and the Grantee shall provide the city with all required information. Failure to provide all information reasonably requested by the city as part of said inquiry shall be grounds for denial of the proposed change, transfer or acquisition of control. 
(d)  Assumption of control. The city agrees that any financial institution having a pledge of the city public rights-of-way agreement or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the city public rights-of-way agreement shall have the right to notify the city that it will take control and operate the grantee's system. 
(e)  No waiver of public property rights. The consent or approval of the city or any other public entity to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the city in and to the public property or city rights-of-way or streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of this chapter. 
(f)  Signatory requirement. Any approval by the city of transfer of ownership or control shall be contingent upon the prospective transferee becoming a signatory to and agreement to be legally bound by the city public rights-of-way agreement.

(Ord. No. 06-32, 7-18-06)  
Sec. 32-5. - Mandatory standards for land-disturbing activity. 
No land-disturbing activity subject to the control of this chapter shall be undertaken except in accordance with the following mandatory standards: 
(1)  Buffer zone. 
a.  Standard buffer. No land-disturbing activity during periods of construction or improvement to land shall be permitted in proximity to a lake or natural watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided along the margin of the watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the twenty-five (25) percent of the buffer zone nearest the land-disturbing activity. 
1.  Projects on, over or under water. This subdivision shall not apply to a land-disturbing activity in connection with the construction of facilities to be located on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse. 
2.  Buffer measurement. Unless otherwise provided, the width of a buffer zone is measured horizontally from the edge of the water to the nearest edge of the disturbed area, with the twenty-five (25) percent of the strip nearer the land-disturbing activity containing natural or artificial means of confining visible siltation. 
b.  Trout buffer. Waters that have been classified as trout waters by the environmental management commission shall have an undisturbed buffer zone twenty-five (25) feet wide or of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the twenty-five (25) percent of the buffer zone nearest the land-disturbing activity, whichever is greater. Provided, however, that the commission may approve plans which include land-disturbing activity along trout waters when the duration of said disturbance would be temporary and the extent of said disturbance would be minimal. 
1.  Projects on, over or under water. This subdivision shall not apply to a land-disturbing activity in connection with the construction of facilities to be located on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse. 
2.  Trout buffer measurement. The twenty-five-foot minimum width for an undisturbed buffer zone adjacent to designated trout waters shall be measured horizontally from the top of the bank to the nearest edge of the disturbed area. 
3.  Limit on land disturbance. Where a temporary and minimal disturbance has been permitted as an exception to the trout buffer, land-disturbing activities in the buffer zone adjacent to designated trout waters shall be limited to a maximum of ten (10) percent of the total length of the buffer zone within the tract to be disturbed such that there is not more than one hundred (100) linear feet of disturbance in each one thousand (1,000) linear feet of buffer zone. Larger areas may be disturbed with the written approval of the director. 
4.  Limit on temperature fluctuations. No land-disturbing activity shall be undertaken within a buffer zone adjacent to designated trout waters that will cause adverse temperature fluctuations in the trout waters, as set forth in 15 NCAC 2B.0211 "Fresh surface Water Classification and Standards." 
(2)  Graded slopes and fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no greater than the angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or other adequate erosion control devices or structures. In any event, slopes left exposed will, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of completion of any phase of grading be planted or otherwise provided with temporary or permanent ground cover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion. The angle for graded slopes and fills must be demonstrated to be stable. Stable is the condition where the soil remains in its original configuration, with or without mechanical constraints. 
(3)  Fill material. Unless a permit from the department's division of waste management to operate a landfill is on file for the official site, acceptable fill material shall be free of organic or other degradable materials, masonry, concrete and brick in sizes exceeding twelve (12) inches, and any materials which would cause the site to be regulated as a landfill by the state. 
(4)  Ground cover. Whenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on a tract comprising more than one (1) acre, if more than one (1) acre is uncovered, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install erosion and sedimentation control devices and practices that are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of said tract, and shall plant or otherwise provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after completion of construction or development. Except as provided in section 32-8(b)(5) of this chapter, provisions for a ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be accomplished within fifteen (15) working days or ninety (90) calendar days following completion of construction or development, whichever period is shorter. 
(5)  Prior plan approval. No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity on a tract if more than one (1) acre is to be uncovered unless, thirty (30) or more days prior to initiating the activity, a plan for such activity is filed with and approved by the city. The city shall forward to the director of the division of water quality a copy of each plan for a land-disturbing activity that involves the utilization of ditches for the purpose of de-watering or lowering the water table of the tract. 
(Ord. No. 06-32, 7-18-06)  
Sec. 32-6. - Erosion and sedimentation control plans. 
(a)  Plan submission. A plan shall be prepared for all land-disturbing activities subject to this chapter whenever the proposed activity is to be undertaken on a tract comprising more than one (1) acre, if more than one (1) acre is to be uncovered. The plan shall be prepared by and bear the signature of a registered professional engineer, surveyor, architect, or landscape architect to the extent permitted by state laws. Three (3) copies of the plan shall be filed with the city; a copy shall be simultaneously submitted to the Alamance or Guilford County Soil and Water Conservation District at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the proposed activity. 
(b)  Financial responsibility and ownership. Plans may be disapproved unless accompanied by an authorized statement of financial responsibility and ownership. This statement shall be signed by the person financially responsible for the land-disturbing activity or his attorney in fact. The statement shall include the mailing and street addresses of the principal place of business of: 
(1)  The person financially responsible; 
(2)  The owner of the land; and 
(3)  Any registered agents. 
If the person financially responsible is not a resident of the state, a state agent must be designated in the statement for the purpose of receiving notice of compliance or noncompliance with the plan, the Act, this chapter, or rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this chapter. 
(c)  Environmental Policy Act document. Any plan submitted for a land-disturbing activity for which an environmental document is required by the North Carolina Environment Policy Act (G.S. § 113A-1 et seq.) shall be deemed incomplete until a complete environmental document is available for review. The city shall promptly notify the person submitting the plan that the thirty-day time limit for review of the plan pursuant to this chapter shall not begin until a complete environmental document is available for review. 
(d)  Content. The plan required by this section shall contain architectural and engineering drawings, maps, assumptions, calculations, and narrative statements as needed to adequately describe the proposed development of the tract and the measures planned to comply with the requirements of this chapter.

The district shall review the plan and submit any comments and recommendations to the city within twenty (20) days after the district received the plan, or within any shorter period of time as may be agreed upon by the district and the city. Failure of the district to submit its comments and recommendations within twenty (20) days or within any agreed-upon shorter period of time shall not delay final action on the plan. 
(f)  Timeline for decisions on plans. The city will review each complete plan submitted to them and within thirty (30) days of receipt thereof will notify the person submitting the plan that it has been approved, approved with modifications, approved with performance reservations, or disapproved. Failure to approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove a complete plan within thirty (30) days of receipt shall be deemed approval. The city will review each revised plan submitted to them and within fifteen (15) days of receipt thereof will notify the person submitting the plan that it has been approved, approved with modifications, approved with performance reservations, or disapproved. Failure to approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove a revised plan within fifteen (15) days of receipt shall be deemed approval. 
(g)  Approval. The city shall only approve a plan upon determining that it complies with all applicable state and local regulations for erosion and sedimentation control. Approval assumes the applicant's compliance with the federal and state water quality laws, regulations and rules. The city shall condition approval of plans upon the applicant's compliance with federal and state water quality laws, regulations and rules. The city may establish an expiration date, not to exceed three (3) years, for plans approved under this chapter. 
(h)  Disapproval for content. The city shall disapprove a plan or draft plan based on its content. A disapproval based upon a plan's content must specifically state in writing the reasons for disapproval. 
(i)  Other disapprovals. The city may disapprove a plan or draft plans if implementation of the plan would result in a violation of the rules adopted by the environmental management commission to protect riparian buffers along surface waters. A local government may disapprove a plan upon finding that an applicant, or a parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of the applicant: 
(1)  Is conducting or has conducted land-disturbing activity without an approved plan, or has received notice of violation of a plan previously approved by the commission or a local government pursuant to the Act and has not complied with the notice within the time specified in the notice; 
(2)  Has failed to pay a civil penalty assessed pursuant to the Act or a local ordinance adopted pursuant to the Act by the time the payment is due.

For purposes of this subsection, an applicant's record may be considered for only the two (2) years prior to the application date. 
In the event that a plan is disapproved pursuant to this subsection, the city shall notify the director of such disapproval within ten (10) days. The city shall advise the applicant and the director in writing as to the specific reasons that the plan was disapproved. 
(j)  Notice of activity initiation. No person may initiate a land-disturbing activity before notifying the agency that issued the plan approval of the date that land-disturbing activity will begin. 
(k)  Preconstruction conference. When deemed necessary by the approving authority a preconstruction conference may be required. 
(l)  Display of plan approval. A plan approval issued under this article shall be prominently displayed until all construction is complete, all permanent sedimentation and erosion control measures are installed and the site has been stabilized. A copy of the approved plan shall be kept on file at the job site. 
(m)  Required revisions. After approving a plan, if the city, either upon review of such plan or on inspection of the job site, determines that a significant risk of accelerated erosion or off-site sedimentation exists, the city shall require a revised plan. Pending the preparation of the revised plan, work shall cease or shall continue under conditions outlined by the appropriate authority. If following commencement of a land-disturbing activity pursuant to an approved plan, the city determines that the plan is inadequate to meet the requirements of this chapter, the city may require any revision of the plan that is necessary to comply with this chapter. 
(n)  Amendment to a plan. Applications for amendment of a plan in written and/or graphic form may be made at any time under the same conditions as the original application. Until such time as said amendment is approved by the city, the land-disturbing activity shall not proceed except in accordance with the plan as originally approved. 
(o)  Failure to file a plan. Any person engaged in land-disturbing activity who fails to file a plan in accordance with this chapter, or who conducts a land-disturbing activity except in accordance with provisions of an approved plan shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 06-32, 7-18-06)  
Sec. 32-7. - Basic control objectives. 
An  erosion and sedimentation control plan may be disapproved if the plan fails to address the following control objectives: 
(1)  Identify critical areas. On-site areas that are subject to severe erosion, and off-site areas that are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special attention. 
(2)  Limit time of exposure. All land-disturbing activities are to be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time. 
(3)  Limit exposed areas. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time. 
(4)  Control surface water. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of exposure. 
(5)  Control sedimentation. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted so as to prevent off-site sedimentation damage. 
(6)  Manage stormwater runoff. When the increase in the velocity of stormwater runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, a plan is to include measures to control the velocity to the point of discharge so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and increased sedimentation of the stream. 
(Ord. No. 06-32, 7-18-06)  
Sec. 32-8. - Design and performance standards. 
(a)  Except as provided in section 32-8(b)(2) of this chapter, erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices shall be planned, designed, and constructed to provide protection from the calculated maximum peak rate of runoff from the ten-year storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the USDA, Soil Conservation Service's "National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices", or other acceptable calculation procedures. 
(b)  HQW zones. In high quality water (HQW) zones the following design standards shall apply: 
(1)  Limit on uncovered area. Uncovered areas in HQW zones shall be limited at any time to a maximum total area of twenty (20) acres within the boundaries of the tract. Only the portion of the land-disturbing activity within a HQW zone shall be governed by this section. Larger areas may be uncovered within the boundaries of the tract with the written approval of the director. 
(2)  Maximum peak rate of runoff protection. Erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices within HQW zones shall be planned, designed and constructed to provide protection from the runoff of the twenty-five-year storm which produces the maximum peak rate of runoff as calculated according to procedures in the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service's "National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices" or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of this state or the United States or any generally recognized organization or association. 
(3)  Settling efficiency. Sediment basins within HQW zones shall be designed and constructed such that the basin will have a settling efficiency of at least seventy (70) percent for the 40 micron (0.04 millimeter) size soil particle transported into the basin by the runoff of that two-year storm which produces the maximum peak rate of runoff as calculated according to procedures in the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service's "National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices" or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of this state or the United States or any generally recognized organization or association. 
(4)  Grade. Newly constructed open channels in HQW zones shall be designed and constructed with side slopes no steeper than two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical if a vegetative cover is used for stabilization unless soil conditions permit a steeper slope or where the slopes are stabilized by using mechanical devices, structural devices or other acceptable ditch liners. In any event, the angle for side slopes shall be sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion. 
(5)  Ground cover. Ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be provided for any portion of a land-disturbing activity in a HQW zone within fifteen (15) working days or sixty (60) calendar days following completion of construction or development, whichever period is shorter. 
(Ord. No. 06-32, 7-18-06)  
Sec. 32-9. - Stormwater outlet protection. 
(a)  Intent. Stream banks and channels downstream from any land disturbing activity shall be protected from increased degradation by accelerated erosion caused by increased velocity of runoff from the land disturbing activity. 
(b)  Performance standard. Persons shall conduct land-disturbing activity so that the post construction velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse to the discharge point does not exceed the greater of: 
(1)  The velocity established by the maximum permissible velocities table set out within this subsection; or 
(2)  The velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse prior to development. 
If condition (1) or (2) of this paragraph cannot be met, then the receiving watercourse to and including the discharge point shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity anywhere the velocity exceeds the "prior to development" velocity by ten (10) percent. 
Maximum Permissible Velocities Table 
The following is a table for maximum permissible velocity for stormwater discharges in feet per second (F.P.S.) and meters per second (M.P.S.): 
Material 	F.P.S. 	M.P.S. 
Fine sand (noncolloidal) 	2.5 	.8 
Sandy loam (noncolloidal) 	2.5 	.8 
Silt loam (noncolloidal) 	3.0 	.9 
Ordinary firm loam 	3.5 	1.1 
Fine gravel 	5.0 	1.5 
Stiff clay (very colloidal) 	5.0 	1.5 
Graded, loam to cobbles (noncolloidal) 	5.0 	1.5 
Graded, silt to cobbles (Colloidal) 	5.5 	1.7 
Alluvial silts (noncolloidal) 	3.5 	1.1 
Alluvial silts (colloidal) 	5.0 	1.5 
Coarse gravel (noncolloidal) 	6.0 	1.8 
Cobbles and shingles 	5.5 	1.7 
Shales and hard pans 	6.0 	1.8 
 
  
SourceAdapted from recommendations by Special Committee on Irrigation Research, American Society of Civil Engineers, 1926, for channels with straight alignment. For sinuous channels, multiply allowable velocity by 0.95 for slightly sinuous, by 0.9 for moderately sinuous channels, and by 0.8 for highly sinuous channels. 
(c)  Acceptable management measures. Measures applied alone or in combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are no objectionable secondary consequences. The city recognizes that the management of stormwater runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and bank erosion is a developing technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce successful results. Some alternatives, while not exhaustive, are to: 
(1)  Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas rendered impervious; 
(2)  Avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in place of closed drains and high velocity paved sections: 
(3)  Provide energy dissipaters at outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities to the point of discharge; 
(4)  Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving cross sections and/or providing erosion-resistant lining; and 
(5)  Upgrade or replace the receiving device structure, or watercourse such that it will receive and conduct the flow to a point where it is no longer subject to degradation from the increased rate of flow or increased velocity. 
(d)  Exceptions. This rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated to the city that stormwater discharge velocities will not create an erosion problem in the receiving watercourse. 
(Ord. No. 06-32, 7-18-06)  
Sec. 32-10. - Borrow and waste areas.

(1)  Any necessary business or health permit has been suspended, revoked or canceled. 
(2)  The permittee does not have insurance in force that is correct and effective in the minimum amount required by the city. 
(3)  Changing conditions of pedestrian or vehicular traffic cause congestion necessitating removal of the encroachment.

(4)  The permittee has failed to correct violations of this article or conditions of his permit upon receipt of the city manager's or his or her designee notice of the violation delivered in writing to the permittee.

If the action is taken based on subsection (a)(2) or (3) of this section, the action shall become effective upon the receipt of such notice and the permittee shall have four (4) hours to remove the items. 
(b)  Notice of denial or revocation. Upon denial or revocation, the administrator shall give notice of such action to the applicant or the permittee, in writing, stating the action that has been taken and the reason therefore. The action shall be effective upon giving such notice to the permittee. 
(c)  Appeals. The permittee shall have the right of appeal and shall give notice of appeal within five (5) working days from receipt of notice. An appeal does not stay the denial or revocation of the encroachment permit. The hearing shall be held within two (2) working days from the date of notice of the request. The permittee or applicant may be represented by an attorney and may present witnesses, affidavits and any relevant documentary evidence. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply. The city manager or his designee shall notify the permittee or applicant of his determination in writing.

(b)  If the director of water resources does not require the user to perform any self-monitoring and the POTW sampling of the user indicates a violation, the director of water resources shall repeat the sampling and obtain the results of the repeat analysis within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violations, unless one of the following occurs: 
(1)  The director of water resources monitors at the user's facility at least once a month; or 
(2)  The director of water resources samples the user between their initial sampling and when the POTW receives the results of this initial sampling; or 
(3)  The director of water resources requires the user to perform sampling and submit the results to the director of water resources within the thirty-day deadline of the POTW becoming aware of the violation.

Sec. 40-129. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
The city prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes without notification to and approval by the director of water resources. 
(a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. The user shall not begin the discharge until receiving written approval from the city. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 40-125 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 40-121, 40-123 and 40-124 of this article. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director of water resources, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.  
Sec. 40-130. - Analytical requirements. 
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA and the city. Analyses must be performed by a state certified lab for each parameter analyzed, if such certification exists for that parameter. 
(Ord. No. 2013-25, 11-19-13)  
Sec. 40-131. - Grab and composite sample collection. 
(a)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(b)  Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other pollutants as required by 40 CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the number of grabs necessary to be representative of the user's discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5) for additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and 90-day compliance reports. Additionally, the director of water resources may allow collection of multiple grabs during a 24-hour period which are composited prior to analysis as allowed under 40 CFR 136. 
(c)  Composite samples: All wastewater composite samples shall be collected with a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the director of water resources. When authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented.

Sec. 40-132. - Timing. 
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 2013-25, 11-19-13)  
Sec. 40-133. - Record keeping. 
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director of water resources. 
(Ord. No. 2013-25, 11-19-13)  
Sec. 40-134. - Electronic reporting. 
The director of water resources may develop procedures for receipt of electronic reports for any reporting requirements of this article. Such procedures shall comply with 40 CFR Part 3. These procedures shall be enforceable under Division 8 of this article.

DIVISION 6. - COMPLIANCE MONITORING 
 
Sec. 40-141. - Monitoring facilities. 
The city requires the user to provide and operate at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of the city and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2013-25, 11-19-13)  
Sec. 40-142. - Inspection and sampling. 
The city will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city, approval authority and EPA or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The city, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the city's, approval authority's, or EPA's access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access. 
(Ord. No. 2013-25, 11-19-13)  
Sec. 40-143. - Search warrants. 
If the city, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the director of water resources, approval authority, or EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from a judicial official of the Court of Alamance County having jurisdiction within the city.

DIVISION 8. - ENFORCEMENT 
 
Sec. 40-161. - Administrative remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. Whenever the director of water resources finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating this article, wastewater permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained therein or any other pretreatment requirement the director of water resources may serve upon such a person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within thirty (30) days from the date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city by the user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The director of water resources is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order issued pursuant to section 40-161(d) below. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The director of water resources may order any industrial user who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this article or is in noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the director of water resources determines that a show-cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
The director of water resources shall review the evidence presented at the hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate. 
A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to the assessment of a civil penalty under section 40-162 nor is any action or inaction taken by the director of water resources under this section subject to an administrative appeal under Section 40-102(h). 
(d)  Administrative orders. When the director of water resources finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article, permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the director of water resources may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to do any of the following: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; 
(2)  Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in the order; 
(3)  Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a continuing or threatened violation; 
(4)  Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified time period. 
(e)  Emergency suspensions. The director of water resources may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit. 
Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. A hearing will be held within fifteen (15) days of the notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user's waste discharge permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director of Water Resources shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The Director of Water Resources shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the director of water resources prior to the date of the above-described hearing. 
(f)  Termination of permit or permission to discharge. The director of water resources may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
(1)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge; 
(2)  Failure to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
(3)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or, 
(4)  Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to discharge, conditions of this article, or any applicable state and federal regulations. 
Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 40-161(c) of this article why the proposed action should not be taken.

The purpose of this Cross Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Ordinance is to define the authority of the City of Burlington as the water purveyor. This article requires the elimination of all cross connections within the city public potable water supply. 
The intent of this article is to eliminate the potential contamination of the potable water within the water supply and distribution systems. It is the intent of this article to provide for the safe conveyance of potable water through the use of backflow prevention and cross connection control practices. It is also the intent to apply the principle that the degree of protection will be commensurate with the degree of hazard. The objectives will be achieved by: 
(a)  Protection of the public potable water supply of the City of Burlington against actual or potential contamination by isolating and or containing, within the consumer's water system, contaminants or pollutants which could, under adverse conditions, backflow through uncontrolled cross connections into the public water system. 
(b)  Elimination or control of existing cross connections and backflows of all types or any other source of water or process water used for any purpose whatsoever which may jeopardize the safety of the public potable water supply of the City of Burlington. 
(c)  Providing for a continuing inspection program which will systematically and effectively control all actual or potential cross connections, which may be installed in the future. 
(d)  Requiring continuous testing and maintenance programs ensuring proper execution of this article. 
This article shall apply to all users connected to the City of Burlington's public potable water supply regardless of whether the user is located within the city limits or outside of the city limits. 
It is the intent of this article to comply with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act (P.L. 93-523), the North Carolina State Administrative Code (Title 15A, Subchapter 18C), and the current North Carolina State Building Code (Volume II, Plumbing), as they pertain to backflow and cross connections with the public water supply. Those regulations are incorporated into this article by reference. For questions or disputes pertaining to the interpretation of the NC State Plumbing Code, the Office of the State Fire Marshall shall be the authority. 
The city is authorized by G.S. 160A-312 to protect and regulate any public enterprise system belonging to it by adequate and reasonable rules and regulations. 
(8-21-18 recodification)  
Sec. 40-201. - Definitions. 
The following definitions shall apply in this article: 
Air-gap separation. An unobstructed vertical distance through the atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying potable water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the flood level rim of the receptacle. An approved air-gap vertical separation shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe. In no case shall the air-gap be less than one (1) inch. 
Approved backflow prevention device, method, or assembly. Any combination of mechanical devices, assemblies, or practices that eliminates or prevents backflow or cross-connection acceptable to the city's cross-connection control office and approved to meet the standards of the University of Southern California Foundation of Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research (USCFCCHR) and the American Society of Sanitary Engineers (ASSE). 
Approved water source. Water that has been approved by the City of Burlington that meets or exceeds federal or state regulations. 
Auxiliary water supply. Water supply to any premise other than that of the approved water source. These auxiliary waters may include water from another public potable water supply or any natural source such as a well, spring, river, stream, etc., or "used waters" or "industrial fluids". They may be polluted or contaminated, or objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the city does not have sanitary control. 
Backflow. The undesirable reversal of flow of water or mixtures of water and other liquids, gases, or other substances into the distribution pipes of the consumer or public potable water system from any source or sources. 
Backflow prevention assembly. Any assembly used for containment and/or isolation purposes that has been shown to meet the standards and specifications as set forth by the City of Burlington's Cross Connection Control Office. 
Backflow prevention assemblyType. An assembly used to prevent backflow into a consumer or public potable water system. The type of assembly used shall be based on the degree of hazard either existing or potential (as defined herein). The types are: 
(1)  Double check valve assembly (DCVA). 
(2)  Double check detector assembly (fire system) (DCDA). 
(3)  Pressure vacuum breaker (PVB). 
(4)  Reduced pressure principle assembly (RP). 
(5)  Reduced pressure principleDetector assembly (fire system) (RPDA). 
Backflow prevention assemblyUnapproved shall mean an assembly that has been investigated by the city's cross connection control office and has been determined to be unacceptable for installation within the city's water system. Consideration for disapproval and removal from the "approved list" shall be based upon, but not limited to, the following criteria: a) poor performance standards (i.e., significant failure rate); b) lack of or unavailability of repair parts; and/or, c) poor service or response from assembly's factory representative(s). 
Back-pressure backflow. A reversed flow of water created by pressure from the customer's water system. This condition may be caused by elevated tanks, circulation pumps, boilers, or by any other means by which pressure is or could be greater than the supply pressure. 
Back-siphonage backflow. Backflow caused by a negative pressure (vacuum) being created in the supply line with the backflow source subject to atmospheric pressure. Firefighting, water main flushing, main breaks or any means by which supply pressure is reduced may cause this condition. 
Bypass loops. Loops installed to circumvent an installed backflow preventer (including detector loops on check valves.) These loops are prohibited unless the loops are equipped with an approved backflow preventer of the same type used on the main supply line. 
Certified tester. A person who has proven his/her competency to test, repair, overhaul, and make reports on backflow prevention assemblies as evidenced by successful completion of a training program approved by the cross connection control office. 
Check valve. A device that is drip-tight in the normal direction of flow when the inlet pressure is at least one (1) psi and the outlet pressure is zero. The check valve shall permit no leakage in a direction reversed to the normal flow. The closure element (clapper, poppet, or other design) shall be internally spring loaded to promote rapid and positive closure. An approved check valve is just one component of an approved backflow prevention assembly i.e. pressure vacuum breaker, double check valve assembly, double check detector assembly, reduced pressure principle assembly, or reduced pressure detector assembly. 
Consumer. Any person, firm, or corporation responsible for any property at which water from the City of Burlington's public water system is received.

Indirect cross connection. Any arrangement of pipes, fittings, or fixtures that may be temporary in nature (i.e. garden hose) connecting a potable water supply to a non-potable or other unapproved water supply. 
Industrial fluids. Any fluid or solution which may be chemically, biologically, or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration such as would constitute a health, or non-health hazard if introduced into a public or consumer potable water system. Such fluids may include, but are not limited to: process waters; chemicals in fluid form; acids and alkalis; oils, gases; etc. 
Interconnection. A connection between the city's potable water and an uncontrollable source of water, such as a private well. Interconnections are considered to be cross connections and are strictly prohibited by this article and state codes. 
Isolation. The act of confining a localized hazard within a consumer's water system by installing approved backflow prevention assemblies, or devices. The City of Burlington may make recommendations, upon facility inspection, as to the usage of isolation devices/assemblies, but does not assume or have responsibility whatsoever for such installations. 
Isolation device/assembly. A device/assembly or methods used for isolation purposes that has been shown to meet the standards of the City of Burlington's Cross Connection Control Office. 
Non-potable water. Water that does not meet drinking water standards and is considered unsafe for consumption is non-potable. All water other than the approved city potable water is considered non-potable for the purposes of this article. 
Pollution. The introduction of impurities into the approved water that potentially degrades the quality of the water. Cross connections and backflow can allow pollution of the approved water and create a potential or actual risk to the public health through contamination of the water. 
Potable water. A source of drinking water, as certified by the City in accordance with state and federal regulations, which has been approved for human consumption. 
Premises. A building, complex, golf course, median, residence, or any other location that receives water provided by the City of Burlington. 
Public potable water system. Any publicly or privately owned water system operated as a public utility, under a current North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality-Division of Water Resources (NCDEQ/DWR) permit, to supply water for public consumption or use. This system will include all sources and facilities, between the source and the point of delivery such as valves, pumps, pipes, conduits, tanks, receptacles, fixtures, equipment, and appurtenances used to produce, convey, treat, or store potable water for public consumption or use. 
Reduced pressure principle assembly. An assembly containing within its structure a minimum of two (2) independently acting spring loaded, approved check valves, with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, pressure differential relief valve located between the check valves. The first check valve reduces the supply pressure a predetermined amount so that during normal flow and at cessation of normal flow, the pressure between the checks shall be at least two (2) pounds less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the pressure differential relief valve shall operate by discharge to atmosphere to maintain the pressure between the checks less than the supply pressure. The unit shall include tightly closing shut-off valves located at each end of the assembly and each assembly shall be fitted with properly located test cocks. This assembly shall be used to protect against health hazard (i.e., contaminant). 
Reduced pressure principle-detector assembly. A specially designed assembly composed of a line-sized approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly with a specific bypass water meter and a meter-sized approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. The meter shall register in U.S. gallons accurately for only very low rates of flow (up to three (3) gallons per minute) and shall show a registration for all rates of flow. This assembly shall be used on fire protection systems. 
Service connection. A connection from the public potable water system to the consumer's water system. 
Thermal expansion. Expansion attributed to heating of water in an enclosed container such as a water heater. 
Vacuum breaker atmospheric type. A device containing a float-check, a check seat, and an air inlet port. The flow of water into the body causes the float to close the air inlet port. When the flow of water stops the float falls and forms a check valve against back-siphonage and at the same time opens the air inlet port to allow air to enter and satisfy the vacuum. A shut-off valve immediately upstream may be an integral part of the device. An atmospheric vacuum breaker is designed to provide isolation protection under a back-siphonage condition only. These devices are not approved in the city's service areas except in special conditions (i.e. lab sinks with a six (6) inch clearance above the highest outlet). 
Vacuum breaker pressure type. An assembly containing an independently operating internally spring-loaded check valve and an independently operating spring-loaded air inlet valve located on the discharge side of the check valve. These devices can be tested for proper operation. Each end of the assembly is to be equipped with properly located approved test cocks and tightly closing approved shut-off valves. This assembly is designed to provide better protection than a vacuum breaker atmospheric type under a back-siphonage condition only. 
Water distribution system. The city's water system, owned and operated as a public enterprise under a valid health permit, and supplying water for domestic purposes. This system will include all sources, facilities and appurtenances between the source and the point of delivery, such as valves, pumps, conduits, mains, tanks, and equipment used to convey, treat, and store potable water for public consumption or use. 
Water purveyor. The owner or operator of a public potable water system, providing an approved water supply to the public. 
Water supplyApproved. Any public potable water supply that has been investigated and approved by NCDEQ/DWR. The system must be operating under a valid health permit. In determining what constitutes an approved water supply, the North Carolina Division of Health Services has reserved the final judgment as to its safety and potability. 
Water supplyUnapproved. A water supply that has not been approved for human consumption by the NCDEQ/DWR. 
WaterUsed. Any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the control of the water purveyor.

DIVISION 2. - IMPLEMENTATION 
 
Sec. 40-202. - Responsibilities. 
(1)  Health agency: The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (Division of Water Resources) has the responsibility for promulgating and enforcing laws, rules, regulations, and policies to be followed in carrying out an effective cross connection control program. 
(2)  The public water supply section of the division of water resources also has the primary responsibility of insuring that the water purveyor operates the public potable water system free of actual or potential sanitary hazards, including unprotected cross connections. They have the further responsibility of insuring that the water purveyor provides an approved water supply at the service connection to the consumer's water system and, further, that the purveyor requires the installation, testing, and maintenance of an approved backflow prevention assembly on the service connection. 
(3)  Water purveyor: The City of Burlington is primarily responsible for the prevention of contamination and pollution of the public water system. Such responsibility begins at the point of origin of the public water supply and includes all of the public water distribution system and ends at the point designated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. In addition, the water purveyor shall exercise reasonable vigilance to ensure that the consumer has taken the proper steps to protect the public potable water system. To ensure that the proper precautions are taken the city is required to determine the degree of hazard or potential hazard to the public potable water system, to determine the degree of protection required, and to ensure proper containment protection through an on-going inspection program. 
(4)  Plumbing inspections: The City of Burlington and Alamance County have the responsibility to review building plans and inspect plumbing as it is installed, and they have the explicit responsibility of preventing cross connections from being designed and built into the plumbing system within their jurisdiction. Where the review of building plans suggests or detects the potential for cross connections as an integral part of the plumbing system, the plumbing inspector has the responsibility, under the North Carolina Building Code, to require that such cross connections be either eliminated or provided with backflow preventers approved by the city's cross connection control office. 
The plumbing inspector's responsibility begins at the point of delivery and continues throughout the entire length of the consumer's water system for new construction. The plan inspector should inquire about the intended use of water at any point where it is suspected that a cross connection might be made or where one is actually called for by the plans. When such is discovered, it shall be mandatory that a suitable, backflow prevention assembly approved by the city's cross connection control office be required by the plans and be properly installed. The primary protection assembly for containment and isolation purposes shall require approval from the City of Burlington's Cross Connection Control Office. 
(5)  Consumer: The consumer shall have the primary responsibility of preventing contamination of the private potable water system(s) and the public potable water system. The consumer's responsibility starts at the point of delivery from the public potable water system and includes the entire water system(s). When it is determined that a backflow prevention assembly is required for the protection of the public system, the director shall require the consumer, at the consumer's expense, to install an approved backflow prevention assembly at each service connection. The consumer, at his or her own expense, shall install, operate, test and maintain approved backflow prevention assemblies as directed by the city. 
The consumer shall be responsible to test the efficacy of any device immediately upon installation and every twelve (12) months thereafter, and to properly repair and maintain such assembly or assemblies. All rubber parts, disks, and springs must be replaced every five (5) years at a minimum. The consumer shall maintain accurate records of each test and subsequent maintenance and repair made to backflow prevention assemblies, including materials and/or replacement parts, and shall maintain such records for a minimum of five (5) years. The records shall be on forms approved by the city's cross connection control office and shall include the list of materials or replacement parts used. Following any repair, overhaul, re-piping or relocation of an assembly the consumer shall have it tested to insure that it is in good operating condition and will prevent backflow. A certified backflow prevention assembly tester shall perform tests, maintenance, and repairs of backflow prevention assemblies. 
(6)  Certified backflow prevention assembly tester. The tester will be responsible for making competent testing and for repairing or overhauling backflow prevention assemblies and making reports of such repair to the consumer and responsible authorities on forms approved by the city's cross connection control office. The tester shall include the list of materials or replacement parts used. The tester shall be equipped with and be competent to use all tools and gauges necessary to properly test, repair, and maintain backflow prevention assemblies. It will be the tester's responsibility to insure that original manufactured parts are used in the repair of the backflow prevention assembly. It will be the tester's further responsibility not to change the design, material, or operational characteristics of an assembly during repair or maintenance without prior approval of the city's cross connection control office. A certified tester shall perform the work and shall be responsible for the competency and accuracy of all tests and reports. A certified tester shall provide a copy of all test and repair reports to the consumer and the city's cross connection control office within ten (10) business days of any completed test or repair work as scheduled by the cross connection control office. A certified tester shall maintain such records for a minimum of five (5) years. 
All certified backflow prevention assembly testers approved by the City must obtain and employ backflow prevention assembly test equipment that has been evaluated and/or approved by the city's cross connection control office. All test equipment shall be registered with the city's cross connection control office. All test equipment shall be checked for accuracy annually (at a minimum), calibrated, if necessary, and certified to the city's cross connection control office as to such calibration, employing an accuracy/calibration method acceptable to the city's cross connection control office. 
All certified backflow prevention assembly testers must become re-certified every two (2) years through an approved backflow prevention certification program as set forth by the city's cross connection control office. 
(7)  The city's cross connection control office: The cross connection control office shall be designated by the director to enforce the provisions of this article to ensure the potability of the consumer's water supply. The enforcement of this program shall extend to the last free flowing tap of the consumer's premises. Enforcement of this program shall also govern the contents within the water distribution system. The cross connection control official shall maintain records of all inspections and tests performed on all premises where a required backflow prevention device is installed for a minimum of five (5) years. This responsibility extends to all new installations, alterations, and/or repair of existing premises to ensure that adequate backflow prevention is employed. The cross connection control office may periodically review available certification programs and modify the approved list to add or delete programs. 
(8-21-18 recodification)  
Sec. 40-203. - Right of entry. 
Authorized representative(s) of the City of Burlington shall have the right to enter, upon presentation of proper credentials and identification, any building, structure, or premises during normal business hours upon notice and request, or at any time during an emergency upon notice and request, and if permission is not granted, then upon the issuance of an administrative search warrant, to perform any duty imposed by this article. These duties may include sampling and testing of water, and inspections and observations of all piping systems connected to the public water supply. Where a user has security measures in force requiring proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with the security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, city personnel will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purpose of performing their specific responsibilities. Refusal to allow entry for these purposes may result in discontinuance of water service and may cause the premises to be classified as a health hazard. 
Upon request, the consumer shall furnish to the city any pertinent information regarding the water supply system on such property where cross connection and backflow are deemed possible. 
(8-21-18 recodification)  
Sec. 40-204. - Elimination of cross connection. 
When cross connections are found, the owner, his agent, the occupant, or the tenant will be notified in writing to disconnect the same within the time limit established by the City of Burlington. The degree of protection required and the maximum time allowed for compliance will be based upon the potential degree of hazard to the public water supply. The maximum time limits are as follows: 
(1)  Cross connections with private wells or other auxiliary water supplies must be disconnected immediately. 
(2)  All industrial and commercial facilities not identified as creating a potential health hazard shall install, as a minimum containment assembly, a double check valve assembly within ninety (90) days of discovery. 
(3)  If, in the judgment of the city's cross connection control office, an imminent health hazard exists, water service to the building or premises where a cross connection exists may be terminated unless an air gap is immediately provided, or the cross connection is immediately eliminated. 
(8-21-18 recodification)  
Sec. 40-205. - Facilities requiring protection. 
Approved backflow prevention assemblies shall be installed on the service line to any premises that the city has identified as having a potential for backflow of contaminated or used water. 
(1)  Water mains served by the City of Burlington but not maintained by the city should be considered cross connections, with degree of hazard to be determined by the director. Degree of protection shall be based on degree of hazard. The minimum level of protection for interconnections with other NCDEQ/DWR-approved municipal systems shall be a single check valve. 
(2)  For premises where, due to security requirements or other prohibitions (research & development), the city does not have access for a complete cross connection evaluation, an approved reduced pressure principle assembly shall be required as minimum protection. 
(3)  Premises having fire protection systems connected with the public water system shall be protected with an approved double check valve assembly as a minimum requirement. All fire systems using booster pumps, chemical agents, or additives to prevent freezing shall at a minimum be protected by an approved reduced pressure principle assembly. The city may require protective device at the right-of-way for best protection. 
(4)  Any connection which requires a meter one inch (1") or greater, or services multifamily units. 
(5)  No person shall fill special use tanks or tankers from the public water system except at a location equipped with an air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly properly installed on the public water supply. 
(6)  No person, firm, or agency may connect to the City's fire hydrant system without approved backflow prevention. Agency refers to City agencies as well as outside agencies. 
The following types of facilities or services have been identified by the city as having a potential for backflow of non-potable water into the public water supply system; therefore, an approved backflow prevention assembly will be required on all such services according to the degree of hazard present. Other types of facilities or services not listed below may also be required to install approved backflow prevention assemblies if determined necessary by the city. As a minimum requirement, all commercial services will be required to install a double check valve assembly, unless otherwise listed below. An air gap is considered a universal means of protection.

O. Reserved:
P. Historic District(s) and Properties Regulations:
1. Purpose
To promote the sound and orderly preservation and conservation of historic
properties and areas and to protect, safeguard and conserve the heritage of the City
of Burlington and any individual property therein that embodies important elements
of its social, economic, cultural, political or architectural history or prehistory for the
education, pleasure and enrichment of residents and all citizens, for the purpose of
fostering civic beauty and for the purpose of stabilizing and enhancing property
values, thus contributing to the improvement of the general health and welfare of
the City of Burlington, this Section 32.2:P is hereby adopted. (Amendment adopted
August 20, 1991)
2. Historic District(s)
(A) Definition of Character of Historic District(s)
Historic Districts established pursuant to N.C.G.S. 160A-400.3 shall consist of
areas that are deemed to be of special significance in terms of their history,
prehistory, architecture, and/or culture and to possess integrity of design,
setting, materials, feeling and association.
(B) Designation of Historic District(s)
Pursuant to N.C.G.S. 160A-400.4., the City Council may designate, and from
time to time amend by ordinance, one or more historic districts, the extent
and boundaries of which are to be indicated on the official zoning map of the
City of Burlington and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Such ordinance may
treat historic districts either as a separate use district classification or as
districts that overlay other zoning districts. Where historic districts are
designated as separate use districts, the Zoning Ordinance may include as
uses by right or as conditional uses those found by the Burlington Historic
32.2
4
Preservation Commission to have existed during the period sought to be
restored or preserved or to be compatible with the restoration or
preservation of the district. Where historic districts are designated as
overlay districts, all uses permitted in any such district, whether by right or
as a Special Use, shall be permitted in a historic district in accordance with
Section 32.9 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Burlington.
However, before any building construction, reconstruction, alteration,
restoration, demolition or moving or any other activity commences that
would alter the exterior appearance of any building, structure or
appurtenant feature within a historic district, a Certificate of Appropriateness
shall be issued by the Burlington Historic Preservation Commission.
(C) Required Historic District Designation and Amendment Procedures:
No historic district or districts shall be designated or amended until the
following procedural steps have been taken:
a. The Burlington Historic Preservation Commission has prepared an
investigation and report describing the significance of the buildings,
structures, features, sites or surroundings included in any such
proposed district and a description of the boundaries of such district
and has made a recommendation thereon to the Burlington Planning
and Zoning Commission.
b. The North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, acting through
the State Historic Preservation Officer or his or her designee, shall
make an analysis of and recommendation concerning such report and
description of proposed boundaries. Failure of the Department of
Cultural Resources to submit its written analysis and recommendation
to the City of Burlington within 30 calendar days after a written
request for such analysis has been received by this state department
shall relieve the City of Burlington of any responsibility for awaiting
such analysis, and the City Council may at any time thereafter take
any necessary action to adopt or amend its Zoning Ordinance.
c. The Burlington Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the
recommendations of the Burlington Historic Preservation Commission
and forward its comments and recommendations to the City Council.
d. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall process and review
historic district zoning and rezoning in the same manner as would
otherwise be required for the adoption or amendment of any
appropriate Zoning Ordinance provision.
32.2
5
e. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall refer any request to
change the zoning classification of property within any historic district
as well as any Special Use Permit or conditional use requested within
a historic district to the Burlington Historic Preservation Commission.
The Historic Preservation Commission shall then make a
recommendation on such request to the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
(D) Required Conformance to Dimensional and Parking Regulations: Exceptions
a. Within any historic district so designated as an overlay district, all
building setbacks, front yard, side yard, rear yard, plot coverage,
and height requirements shall comply with the dimensional
requirements of the applicable zoning district, unless the Historic
District Regulations set other requirements. It is the intent of this
ordinance to supersede, within the historic district, the dimensional
regulations of the applicable zoning district, when specific
requirements particular to the historic district are so defined.
b. Where it is found by the Historic Preservation Commission that an
application for a building permit in any historic district covers activity
constituting an authentic restoration or reconstruction of a building or
structure that existed at the same location, but such building or
structure does not comply with the dimensional requirements of the
applicable zoning district, said building or structure may be restored
or reconstructed at the same location where the original building or
structure was located upon approval by the Board of Adjustment,
provided no use other than that permitted in accordance with Section
32.9 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Burlington is made of said
property. Such conditions as may be set by the Historic Preservation
Commission and the Board of Adjustment shall be the criteria for the
issuance of the building permit.
c. The Board of Adjustment shall not be authorized in action undertaken
by this ordinance to approve a use of property that is not a use
permitted by right or as a special use within the district in which the
property is located. In addition to any other condition, the Board of
Adjustment may make regarding such authorization, any items
restored, reconstructed or maintained on, over or within a public
sidewalk, public alley area or other such public way shall be the
responsibility of the owner, his heirs and assigns. The owners
restoration, reconstruction or maintenance of any such item within
such areas shall constitute the owners agreement to protect and hold
the City of Burlington blameless against any and all liability, cost,
damage or expense suffered by the City of Burlington as a result of or
32.2
6
growing out of the restoration, reconstruction, or maintenance
thereof. Such items, so approved, may be lawfully restored,
reconstructed, or maintained. Any such item projecting over
the vehicular truck way of a street or alley shall be, at its lowest
point, 14 feet above the travel way.
d. Where the Historic Preservation Commission, in considering an
application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, shall find that
the number of off-street parking spaces or design standards
required by the zoning regulations for a building or structure
for which a building permit is requested would render the
building incompatible with the historic aspects of the district, it
may recommend to the Board of Adjustment a waiver, in part or
in whole, of the off-street parking requirements. The Board of
Adjustment may authorize as a special exception a reduced
standard concerning off-street parking, provided: (1) the Board
finds that the lesser standard will not create problems due to
increased on-street parking; and (2) will not constitute a threat
to public safety.
3. Historic Properties
(A) Adoption of an Ordinance of Designation
Upon complying with N.C.G.S. 160A-400.6., the Burlington City
Council may adopt and from time to time amend or repeal an
ordinance designating one or more historic properties within the City
of Burlington and the Citys extraterritorial jurisdiction.
a. The ordinance shall describe each property designated therein,
the name or names of the owner or owners of the property,
those elements of the property that are integral to its historical,
architectural and/or archaeological significance, including the
land area of the property so designated and any other
information the Historic Preservation Commission and the City
Council deem necessary.
b. For each building, structure, site, area or object designated as a
historic property, the ordinance shall require that the waiting
period set forth in Subsection 9, Delay in Demolition of Historic
Properties and Buildings Within Historic Districts, be observed
prior to its demolition.
c. For each designated historic property, the ordinance may also
provide for a suitable sign on the property stating that the
property has been so designated. If the owner consents, the
sign shall be placed upon the property. If the owner objects,
the sign shall be placed on a nearby public right-of-way.
32.2
7
(B) Criteria for Historic Property Designation
No property, building, structure, site, area or object shall be recommended
for designation as a historic property unless it is deemed and found by the
Historic Preservation Commission and City Council to be of special
significance in terms of its historical, pre-historical, architectural, or cultural
importance, and to possess integrity of design, setting, workmanship,
materials, feeling and/or association (N.C.G.S. 160A-400.5.).
(C) Required Historic Property Designation Procedures
As a guide for the identification and evaluation of historic properties, the
Historic Preservation Commission shall undertake, at the earliest possible
time and consistent with the resources available to it, an inventory of
properties of historical, architectural, pre-historical, and cultural significance
within its jurisdiction. Such inventories and any additions or revisions
thereof shall be submitted as expeditiously as possible to the Division of
Archives and History of the State of North Carolina. The Historic Preservation
Commission shall also (1) prepare and adopt rules of procedure, and (2)
prepare and adopt principles and guidelines not inconsistent with the North
Carolina General Statutes for altering, restoring, moving, or demolishing
properties designated as historic.
No ordinance designating a historic building, structure, site, area or object
as a historic property nor any amendment thereto may be adopted, nor may
any property be accepted or acquired by the Historic Preservation
Commission or the City Council until all the following procedural steps have
been taken:
a. Designation Reports Prepared by the Commission
A Designation Committee shall be established from the membership
of the Historic Preservation Commission to review the inventory of
properties of historical, architectural, archaeological, and cultural
significance within the Commissions jurisdiction and recommend to
the full Commission from time to time the designation of historic
properties. If the Commission accepts the recommendation of the
Designation Committee that a property be considered for
designation, the Commission shall make or cause to be made an
investigation and report meeting the minimum standards in the
following Subsection 3(C)c., Standards for Designation Reports.
When a designation report is prepared by the Commission and is to
be considered at a Commission meeting, the chairman shall notify by
mail (mailed not less than seven calendar days prior to the meeting at
which the matter is to be heard) the owners of the property and the
owners of abutting property.
32.2
8
b. Designation Reports Prepared by the Property Owner
To receive consideration for designation of a property as historic, a
property owner must prepare an application meeting the minimum
standards contained in the following Subsection 3(C)c., Standards for
Designation Reports. Applications prepared by the property owners
will be judged according to the same criteria as those prepared by
the Commission. Property owner applications shall be prepared on
forms provided by the City Planning Department.
The Designation Committee shall also review applications for historic
property designation submitted by property owners. The committee
shall be available to meet with the applicant at an early stage in the
process of preparing the application in order to advise the applicant
informally concerning the Commissions standards for reports, the
criteria for designation, the boundaries of the property to be
designated, and other relevant matters.
The Designation Committee, collectively and individually, shall
refrain from any indication of approval or disapproval, but shall not
for that reason, be barred from reasonable discussion of the
applicants proposals. No advice or opinion given, or reported as
having been given, by any member of the committee at such
information meeting(s) shall in any way be official or binding upon
the Historic Preservation Commission.
An application for designation prepared by the property owner and
meeting all of the standards contained in Subsection 3(C)c.,
Standards for Designation Reports, must be received at least 14
calendar days prior to the next meeting of the Commission to be
considered at that meeting.
c. Standards for Designation Reports
The Commission or a property owner shall make or cause to be made
an investigation and a report on the historic, architectural, prehistorical,
educational or cultural significance of each building
structure, site, area or object proposed for designation or acquisition
(N.C.G.S. 160A-400.6 (2)). Such report and investigation shall include
the suggested minimum standards as set forth by the North Carolina
Division of Archives and History. These standards are outlined in a
Manual for Owners of Historic Properties which may be obtained from
the City Planning Department.
d. Consideration of the Report
Once the designation report has been prepared, either by the
Commission or by the property owner, and once the notification
required by Subsection 3(C)a., Designation Reports Prepared by the
32.2
9
Commission, has been met, the Commission shall consider the report.
The Commission may accept it, amend it, reject it, or recommend
further study. If the report is accepted by the Commission, the City
Planning Department shall forward the report to the Division of
Archives and History, North Carolina Department of Cultural
Resources for review.
e. Review by the Department of Cultural Resources
The Department of Cultural Resources, acting through the State
Historic Preservation Officer, shall be given the opportunity to review
and comment upon the substance and effect of the designation of any
proposed historic property pursuant to the N.C.G.S. 160A-400.6(3). If
the department fails to submit written comments or recommendations
in connection with any designation within 30 days following receipt of
the Designation Report, the Commission and the City Council shall be
relieved of any responsibility to consider such comments in
accordance with N.C.G.S. 160A-400.6(3).
f. Upon receipt of the comments and recommendations from the
Department of Cultural Resources, the Commission shall submit a
copy of the Designation Report and a copy of the proposed ordinance
of designation to the City Council.
g. The Commission and the City Council shall hold a joint or separate
public hearing(s) on the proposed ordinance. Reasonable notice of
the time and place of each hearing shall be given. If separate
hearings are held, written notice of the hearing with the Historic
Preservation Commission shall be mailed to the applicant and to all
owners and occupants of adjoining or abutting properties whose
identity and current mailing address can be ascertained by the
exercise of reasonable diligence. Notice of the City Council hearing
shall be published at least once in a newspaper generally circulated
within the city in which the property or properties to be designated or
acquired are located. All such notices shall be published or mailed
not less than 10 nor more than 20 days prior to the date of the public
hearing(s). All meetings of the Commission shall be open to the
public in accordance with North Carolina Open Meetings Law,
Chapter 143, Article 33C.
h. Following the joint or separate public hearing(s), the City Council
may adopt the ordinance as proposed, adopt the ordinance with any
amendments it deems necessary, or reject the proposed ordinance.
i. Upon adoption of the ordinance, the owners and occupants of each
designated historic property shall be given written notification of
such designation by the City Council, insofar as reasonable diligence
32.2
10
permits. One copy of the ordinance and each amendment
thereto shall be filed by the Historic Preservation Commission
in the office of the Register of Deeds of Alamance County. Each
historic property designated in the ordinance shall be indexed
accordingly to the name of the owner of the property in the
grantee and grantor indexes in the Register of Deeds office, and
the Historic Preservation Commission shall pay a reasonable fee
for filing and indexing.
A second copy of the ordinance and each amendment thereto
shall also be kept on file in the office of the City Clerk and be
made available for public inspection at any reasonable time.
A third copy of the ordinance and each amendment thereto shall
be given to the City or County Building Inspector. The fact that
a building, structure, site, area or object has been designated a
historic property shall be clearly indicated on all tax maps
maintained by Alamance County for such period as the
designation remains in effect.
j. Upon adoption of the historic property ordinance or any
amendment thereto, it shall be the duty of the Commission to
give notice thereof to the tax supervisor of Alamance County.
The designation and any recorded restrictions upon the
property limiting its use for preservation purposes shall be
considered by the tax supervisor in appraising it for tax
purposes, in accordance with N.C.G.S. 105-278, Taxation.
(D) Designation of Interior Features
In accordance with G.S. 160A-400.9(b), specific interior features of
architectural, artistic or historical significance in publicly owned
properties and of privately owned properties that the owner has given
consent for interior review may be designated as historic properties.
This designation authority does not apply to interiors of buildings or
structures owned by the State of North Carolina.
Said consent of an owner for interior review of privately owned
properties shall bind future owners and/or successors in title,
provided such consent has been filed in the office of the Register of
Deeds of Alamance County and indexed according to the name of the
owner in the grantee and grantor indexes. The historic properties
designation ordinance shall specify the interior features to be
reviewed and the specific nature of the Historic Preservation
Commissions jurisdiction over the interior.
32.2
11
(E) Application Fees
The Historic Preservation Commission is authorized to establish an
application fee for the submission of historic property designation reports.
This fee shall be no more than necessary to defray the cost of processing the
designation report, advertising the public notice, recording the designation
ordinance, and preparing the sign for the historic property.
4. Certificate of Appropriateness
(A) Certificate of Appropriateness Required
From and after the designation of a historic property or a historic district, no
exterior portion of any building or other structure (including masonry walls,
fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant features) nor
above-ground utility structure nor any type of outdoor advertising sign shall
be erected, altered, restored, moved or demolished on such property or
within such district until after an application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness as to exterior features has been submitted to and approved
by the Historic Preservation Commission.
For the purposes of this ordinance, exterior features shall include the
architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of the exterior
of a building or other structure, including the kind and texture of the building
material, the size and scale of the building, and the type and style of all
windows, doors, light fixtures, signs, and other appurtenant fixtures. In the
case of outdoor advertising signs, exterior features shall be construed to
mean the style, material, size and location of all such signs. Such exterior
features may in the discretion of the Historic Preservation Commission,
include historic signs, color, and significant landscape, archaeological, and
natural features of the area.
A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be issued prior to the issuance of a
building permit or other permit granted for the purposes of constructing,
altering, moving or demolishing structures. A Certificate of Appropriateness
shall be issued or denied, subject to such reasonable conditions as the
Historic Preservation Commission may impose thereon, according to such
standards and guidelines as set forth elsewhere in this ordinance or adopted
by the Historic Preservation Commission. A Certificate of Appropriateness
shall be required for all activities specified in this ordinance whether or not a
building or other permit is required. Any building permit or such other
permit not issued in conformity with this ordinance shall be made invalid.
The discontinuance of work or the lack of progress toward achieving
compliance with a Certificate of Appropriateness for any period of six
months shall render the certificate null and void, and application may be
32.2
12
made for a new certificate. The issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness
does not run with the land and cannot be conveyed in the sale of property.
The City of Burlington and all public utilities shall be required to obtain a
Certificate of Appropriateness prior to initiating in a historic district any
changes in the character of street paving, sidewalks, utility installations,
lighting, street trees, walls, fences or exterior of structures and buildings on
property, easements or streets in which they have a fee or other interest.
Except for the designation of interior features as provided for in Subsection
3(D) of this ordinance, the Historic Preservation Commission shall have no
jurisdiction over interior arrangement and shall take no action under this
section except to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration,
restoration, moving or demolition of buildings, structures, appurtenant
fixtures, outdoor advertising signs, or other significant features in the district
that would be incongruous with the special character of the historic property
or district.
Pursuant to N.C.G.S. 160A-400.9(f), the State of North Carolina, its political
subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities shall be subject to the
requirements for obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness as provided in
this ordinance.
(B) Application for Certificate of Appropriateness
Prior to any action to enforce a historic district or historic property
ordinance, the Commission shall (1) prepare and adopt rules of procedure;
and (2) prepare and adopt architectural and historic guidelines not
inconsistent with this ordinance for new construction, alterations, additions,
moving and demolition. The guidelines for each historic district and/or
historic property may provide, subject to prior adoption of detailed
standards by the Historic Preservation Commission, for a Planning
Department administrative official to review and approve applications for a
Certificate of Appropriateness for minor works as defined in the guidelines;
provided, however, that no application for a Certificate of Appropriateness
may be denied without formal action by the Historic Preservation
Commission.
An application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be obtained from
and, when completed, filed with the Burlington Planning Department. The
application shall be filed no later than 15 working days prior to the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the Historic Preservation Commission. Each
application shall be accompanied by sketches, drawings, photographs,
specifications, descriptions and/or other information of sufficient detail to
clearly show the proposed move, exterior alterations, additions, changes,
new construction or demolition. (Amendment adopted May 18, 1993)
32.2
13
(C) Action on Application for Certificate of Appropriateness
The Planning Department will make a reasonable attempt to identify and
notify by mail the owners of any property within 100 feet of all sides of the
property that is the subject of the application. The Planning Department shall
transmit the application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, together with
the supporting information and material, to the Historic Preservation
Commission for consideration. The Historic Preservation Commission shall
review and act upon the application within 75 days from the filing date of the
application, otherwise, failure to act upon the application shall be deemed to
constitute approval, and a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be issued.
Nothing herein shall prohibit an extension of time where mutual agreement
has been reached between the Historic Preservation Commission and the
applicant.
Prior to issuance or denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness, the
Commission shall give the applicant and other property owners likely to be
affected by the application an opportunity to be heard. In cases where the
Commission deems it necessary, it may hold a public hearing concerning the
application, view the premises and seek the advice of the Division of
Archives and History or other expert advice. All meetings or hearings of the
Commission shall be open to the public in accordance with the North
Carolina Open Meetings Law, Chapter 143, Article 33C.
The Commission shall not refuse to issue a Certificate of Appropriateness
except for the purpose of preventing the construction, reconstruction,
alteration, restoration, moving or demolition of buildings, structures,
appurtenant features, signs or other significant features on a historic
property or in the historic district that would be incongruous with the special
character of the district or a historic property.
An appeal may be taken to the Board of Adjustment from the Commissions
action in granting or denying any certificate, which appeals (1) may be taken
by any aggrieved party; (2) shall be taken within 30 days after the decision
of the Commission; and (3) shall be in the nature of certiorari. Any appeal
from the Board of Adjustments decision in any such case shall be heard by
the Superior Court of Alamance County.
The State of North Carolina and its agencies shall have a right of appeal to
the North Carolina Historical Commission or any successor agency assuming
its responsibilities under G.S. 121-12(a) from any decision of the Historic
Preservation Commission. The North Carolina Historical Commission shall
render its decision within 30 days from the date that the notice of appeal by
the State is received. The current edition of the Secretary of the Interiors
Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating
Historic Building shall be the sole principles and guidelines used in
32.2
14
reviewing applications of the State for Certificates of Appropriateness.
The decision of the Historical Commission shall be final and binding
upon both the State and the Historic Preservation Commission.
(D) Review Criteria, Guidelines and Standards
The Historic Preservation Commission shall adopt detailed
Architectural and Historic Guidelines for designated historic districts
and designated historic properties. These guidelines shall take into
account the historic and architectural significance and visual and
historic elements of properties and of structures unique to the district.
In reviewing a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Commission shall
consider the exterior form and appearance of any proposed addition
or modification to a historic property or structure within the district in
accordance with these adopted guidelines.
All adopted Architectural and Historic Guidelines shall be updated at
least every five years by the Historic Preservation Commission.
Amendments to the guidelines shall be considered by the Commission
only at advertised public hearings. At a minimum, the guidelines shall
contain criteria addressing the following factors:
a. Historic Significance or Quality:
The presence of historic quality or historical significance worthy
of protection may be found in buildings, sites, structures,
objects or entire districts in the city. Integrity of location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association
are important elements in determining the extent and type of
protection required. Association with historic significance
might take the following forms:
(1) Events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of local, state or national history;
(2) Association with the lives of persons significant to the
city, state or national history;
(3) Embodiment of distinctive characteristics of a type,
period or method of construction;
(4) Representation of a period or method of construction of
an acknowledged master;
(5) Examples of high artistic value;
32.2
15
(6) Representation of a significant and distinguishable entity
whose components may lack individual distinction;
(7) Entities that have yielded or may yield information in
prehistory or local, state or national history.
(b) Exterior Form and Appearance:
Exterior features include the architectural form and style, general
design and general arrangement of the exterior of a building or other
structure, including the kind and texture of the building material, the
size and scale of the building and the type, pattern and style of all
windows, doors, light fixtures, signs and other appurtenant fixtures.
In the case of signs, exterior features shall be construed to mean the
style, material, size and location of all such signs. In considering
exterior form and appearance, the Commission may take into
account, but is not limited to, the following elements to ensure that
they are consistent with the historic or visual character of
characteristics of the district:
(1) The height of the building;
(2) The setback and placement on lot of the building, including lot
coverage and orientation;
(3) Exterior construction materials, including textures and
patterns and color;
(4) Architectural detailing, such as lintels, cornices, brick bond,
foundation materials and decorative wooden features;
(5) Roof shapes, forms and materials;
(6) Proportions, shapes, positioning and locations, patterns and
sizes of any elements of fenestration;
(7) General form and proportions of buildings and structures;
(8) Appurtenant fixtures and other features such as lighting,
historic signs, outdoor advertising signs or other types of signs
with the exception of traffic control signs;
(9) Structural condition and soundness;
(10) Use of local or regional architectural traditions;
(11) Significant archaeological features of the area; and
(12) Effect of trees and other important landscape and natural
features.
32.2
16
5. Conflict with Other Laws
Whenever this ordinance requires a longer waiting period or imposes other higher
standards with respect to a designated historic property or district than are
established under any other statute, charter provision, regulation or ordinance, this
ordinance shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any other statute, charter
provision, ordinance or regulation require a longer waiting period or impose other
higher standards than are established under this ordinance, such other statute,
charter provision, ordinance or regulation shall govern.
6. Remedies
In case any building, structure, site, area or object designated as a historic property
or located within a historic district is about to be demolished (whether as the result
of deliberate neglect or otherwise), materially altered, remodeled, removed or
destroyed, except in compliance with this ordinance and applicable state law, the
City of Burlington, the Historic Preservation Commission and any other party
aggrieved by such action may institute any demolition, destruction, material
alteration, remodeling or removal, to restrain, correct or abate such violation, or to
prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic building, structure,
site, area or object. Such remedies shall be in addition to any others authorized by
state law for violation of a municipal ordinance.
7. Appropriations
The City Council is authorized to make appropriations to the Historic Preservation
Commission established pursuant to this ordinance in any amount that it may
determine necessary for the expenses of the operation of the Commission and may
make available any additional amounts necessary for the acquisition, restoration,
preservation, operation and management of historic buildings, structures, sites,
areas or objects designated as historic properties or within designated historic
districts, or of land on which historic buildings or structures are located or to which
they may be removed.
All lands, buildings, structures, sites, areas or objects acquired by funds
appropriated by the City of Burlington shall be acquired in the name of the City of
Burlington unless otherwise provided by the City Council. So long as owned by the
City of Burlington, historic properties may be maintained by or under the
supervision and control of the City of Burlington. However, all lands, buildings, or
structures acquired by the Historic Preservation Commission from funds other than
those appropriated by the City of Burlington may be acquired and held in the name
of the Historic Preservation Commission, City of Burlington or both.
8. Certain Changes Not Prohibited
Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent:
32.2
17
(A) The ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural
feature in a historic district or of a historic property that does not
involve a change in design, material or appearance thereof.
(B) The construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving or
demolition of any such feature that the building inspector or similar
official shall certify is required to protect the public safety because of
any unsafe or dangerous condition.
(C) A property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited
by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.
(D) The maintenance, or in the event of an emergency, the immediate
restoration of any existing above-ground utility structure without
approval by the Historic Preservation Commission.
9 Delay in Demolition of Historic Properties and Buildings Within Historic
District(s)
(A) Upon receipt of a request for a demolition permit, the Chief Building
Inspector shall deem whether or not the building, structure or site is
located within a historic district or is a designated historic property;
and if so, the person desiring the permit shall be notified that an
application must be filed with the Historic Preservation Commission
for a Certificate of Appropriateness.
(B) An application for a Certificate of Appropriateness authorizing the
relocation, demolition or destruction of a designated historic property
or a building, structure or site within a historic district may not be
denied except as provided in 9(D) below. However, the effective date
of such a certificate may be delayed for a period of up to 365 days
from the date of approval. The maximum period of delay authorized
by this ordinance shall be reduced by the Commission where it finds
that the owner would suffer extreme hardships or be permanently
deprived of all beneficial use of or return from such property by virtue
of the delay. During such period, the Historic Preservation
Commission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties
in an effort to find a means of preserving the building or site. The
Commission may enter into negotiations with the owner for the
acquisition by gift, purchase, exchanges or otherwise of the property
or any interest therein authorized by G.S. 160A-400.8. The City
Council may exercise in accordance with G.S. 40A-3(b) its power of
eminent domain to acquire designated historic properties for which a
Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition has been filed. If the
Historic Preservation Commission finds that the building or site within
a district has no particular significance or value toward maintaining
the character of a district, it shall waive all or part of such period and
authorize earlier demolition or removal.
32.2
18
If the Commission has voted to recommend designation of a property
as historic or designation of an area as a district and final designation
has not been made by the City Council, the demolition or destruction
of any building, site or structure located on the proposed historic
property or in the proposed district may be delayed by the
Commission for a period of 180 days or until the City Council takes
final action on the designation, whichever occurs first.
(C) The City Council may enact an ordinance to prevent the demolition by
neglect of any designated historic property or any building or
structure within an established historic district. Such ordinance shall
provide appropriate safeguards to protect property owners from
undue economic hardships.
(D) An application for a Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition or
destruction of a building, site or structure determined by the State
Historic Preservation Officer as having statewide significance
according to the criteria of the National Register of Historic Places may
be denied except where the Commission finds that such denial would
cause the owner to suffer extreme hardship or be permanently
deprived of all beneficial use or return from the property.
(10) Compliance
Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall be enforced by the
City of Burlington. Any person violating any provision of this ordinance or
failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be punishable in
accordance with Section 32.18, Enforcement of the City Zoning Ordinance.
(11) Severability
The provisions of the ordinance are severable, and if any section or part shall
be held invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity
of the remaining portions of the ordinance, it being the declared intent of the
City Council that this ordinance would have been adopted had such invalid
or unconstitutional provision not been included herein.

Carolina has in Chapter 160A, Article 19, Section 381 (Planning and
Regulation of Development, Zoning) directed local government units
to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare of the community. The City Council for the City of
Burlington does hereby ordain and enact into law that City Ordinance
Section 32.2:Q is hereby repealed and deleted in its entirety and a
new Section 32.2:Q is written to read as follows:
32.2
23
b. Jurisdiction  The provisions of these Regulations shall apply within the
areas designated as a Public Water Supply Watershed by the N.C.
Environmental Management Commission and shall be defined and
established on the map entitled Watershed Protection Map of
Burlington, North Carolina (the Watershed Map), that is adopted
simultaneously herewith. The Watershed Map and all explanatory
matter contained thereon accompany and are hereby made a part of
these Regulations. Watershed Critical Area boundaries are
delineated on the following Alamance County Tax Maps: 2-1, 2-2, 2-3,
2-3A, 2-9, 3-22F, 3-23, 3-23A, 3-23B. These Regulations shall be

Federal or State law or regulation or any ordinance or
regulation pertaining thereto except any ordinance that these
Regulations specifically replace.
(2) It is not intended that these Regulations interfere with any
easement, covenants or other agreements between parties.
However, if the provisions of these Regulations impose greater
restrictions or higher standards for the use of a building or land,
then the provisions of these Regulations shall control.
(3) Existing development, as defined in these Regulations, is
regulated under the provisions as stated in 4.a.(3)(m).
(Amendment adopted June 17, 2003)

of these Regulations, regardless of whether or not a vested right
has been established, may be developed for single-family
residential purposes without being subject to the restrictions of
these Regulations.
32.2
24
d. Repeal of Existing Watershed Regulations  These Regulations in part
carry forward by re-enactment some of the Watershed Protection
Regulations of the County of Alamance, North Carolina, adopted by
the Board of County Commissioners on September 20, 1993, and it is
not the intention to repeal but rather to re-enact and continue in force
such existing provisions so that all rights and liabilities that have
accrued thereunder are preserved and may be enforced. All
provisions of the Watershed Regulations that are not re-enacted herein
are hereby repealed. All suits at law or in equity and/or all
prosecutions resulting from the violation of any regulatory provisions
heretofore in effect that are now pending in any court of this State or of
the United States, shall not be abated or abandoned by reason of the
adoption of these Regulations, but shall be prosecuted to their finality
the same as if these Regulations had not been adopted; and any and all
violations of the existing Watershed Protection Regulations,
prosecutions for which have not yet been instituted, may be hereafter
filed and prosecuted; and nothing in these Regulations shall be so
construed as to abandon, abate or dismiss any litigation or prosecution
now pending and/or that may heretofore have been instituted or
prosecuted.
e. Remedies
(1) If any subdivision, development and/or land use is found to be
in violation of these Regulations, the City Manager may initiate
an action in the name of the City of Burlington, in addition to all
other remedies available either at law or in equity, institute an
action or proceedings to restrain or correct the violation; an
action to prevent occupancy of the building, structure, or land;
or an action to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use
in or about the premises. No activity, situation, structure or land
use shall be allowed within the watershed area that poses a
threat to water quality and the public health, safety and welfare.
Such conditions may arise from inadequate on-site sewage
systems that utilize ground absorption; inadequate
sedimentation and erosion control measures; the improper
storage and disposal of junk, trash or other refuse within a
buffer area; the absence or improper implementation of a spill
containment plan for toxic and hazardous materials; the
improper management of stormwater runoff or any other
situation found to pose a threat to water quality. All remedies as
outlined in Section 32.18 of this ordinance are available to
address public health violations as specified above. In addition
to all local remedies, the North Carolina Environmental
Management Commission may assess civil penalties in
accordance with North Carolina General Statute 143-215.6 (A).
32.2
25
(2) If the Chief Building Inspector of the City of Burlington finds that
any of the provisions of these Regulations are being violated,
the administrator shall notify in writing the person responsible
for such violations, indicating the nature of the violations and
ordering the action necessary to correct it. He shall order
discontinuance of the illegal use of land, buildings or structures;
removal of illegal buildings or structures or of additions,
alterations or structural changes thereto; discontinuance of any
illegal work being done; or shall take any action authorized by
these Regulations to ensure compliance with or to prevent
violation of its provisions. If a ruling of the Chief Building
Inspector is questioned, the aggrieved party or parties may
appeal such a ruling to the Board of Adjustment within 30 days
of such ruling.
f. Severability  Should any section or provision of these Regulations be
declared invalid or unconstitutional by any court or competent
jurisdiction, the declaration shall not affect the validity of these
Regulations as a whole or any part thereof that is not specifically
declared to be invalid or unconstitutional.
g. Effective Date  These Regulations shall take effect and be in force on
March 5, 1996.
4. Development Regulations
a. Watershed Areas Described and Identified  For purposes of these
Regulations, watersheds in the City of Burlington, including the area
within the extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ), are identified as well as a
WS-IV-CA Watershed Critical Area (WCA). The Great Alamance
Creek Watershed is identified as a WCA. The WCA is the area
extending either one mile from the normal pool elevation of a water
supply reservoir or to the ridge line of the watershed(whichever
comes first); or one mile up stream from the intake located directly in
the stream or river (run of the river), or the ridge line of the watershed
(whichever comes first). The Balance of Watershed (BOW) is defined
as the entire land area contributing surface drainage to a specific
point, the public water supply intake, minus the Watershed Critical
Area. In order to maintain a predominantly undeveloped land use
density pattern in the Watershed Critical Area, single-family
residential uses shall be allowed at a maximum of one dwelling unit
per two acres (one dwelling unit/two acres). All other residential and
non-residential development shall be allowed at a maximum six

infiltration area, filter basin, etc.) meeting the
performance standards of control of the first one inch of
rainfall and removal of 85 percent total suspended solids
(TSS) and meeting the guidelines in the North Carolina
Department of Environment and Natural Resources
(NCDENR) Stormwater Best Management Practices
Guide. A North Carolina registered professional with
qualifications appropriate for the type of system required
shall design all stormwater control structures. These
professionals are defined as professional engineers,
landscape architect, to the extent that the North Carolina
General Statutes, Chapter 89A, allow and land surveyors,
to the extent that the design represents incidental
drainage within a subdivision as provided in N.C.G.S. 89
(C)-3(7). (Amendment adopted June 17, 2003)
(f) Maintenance Responsibilities: (Amendment adopted
June 17, 2003)
1) When runoff control structures serve more than
one lot, a homeowners' association or binding
contract for the purpose of maintenance shall be
required.
32.2
29
2) Maintenance of runoff control structures shall be
performed at such time as the designated
sediment storage volume of the structure has been
lost to sediment or a part of the installation is not
functioning as originally designed. The
Enforcement Officer shall have the responsibility
to inspect runoff control structures annually, to
record the results on forms approved or supplied
by the North Carolina Division of Water Quality
and to notify the responsible property owner of
homeowners' association when maintenance or
repairs are required.
All required repairs and maintenance shall be
performed within 90 days after such notice. In
case of failure by the responsible party to perform
the required maintenance or repairs within the
stated period, the jurisdiction may perform such
maintenance or repairs and recover all costs plus
an additional 10 percent from the property owner
or homeowners' association.
(g) Stream Buffer  A 50-foot stream buffer measured from
each bank is required along all perennial streams when
utilizing the low-density option. A 100-foot stream buffer
measured from each bank is required along all perennial
streams when utilizing the high-density option.
(Amendment adopted September 2, 2003)
(h) Lake Buffer  A 100-foot wide natural buffer shall be
maintained around all water supply reservoirs, measured
from the normal pool elevation outward. Desirable
artificial streambank or shoreline stabilization is
permitted. No new development is allowed in the buffer
except for water dependent structures and public
projects such as road crossings and greenways where no
practical alternative exists. These activities should
minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from
the surface waters and maximize the utilization of North
Carolina Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (NCDENR) Stormwater Best Management
Practices.
(i) Cluster Development  Clustering of development is
encouraged and allowed in the watershed under the
following conditions:
32.2

cluster development projects; however, the
total number of lots shall not exceed the number of
lots allowed for single-family detached
development in 4.a.(3)(a) above. Density or builtupon
areas for the project shall not exceed that
allowed for the critical area. (Amendment
adopted June 17, 2003)
2) All built-upon areas shall be designed and located
to minimize runoff impact to the receiving waters
and minimize concentrated stormwater flow.
3) The remainder of the tract shall remain in a
vegetated or natural state. The title to the open
space area shall be conveyed to an incorporated
homeowners' association for management; to a
local government for preservation as a park or
open space; or to a conservation organization for
preservation in a permanent easement. Where a
property association is not incorporated, a
maintenance agreement shall be filed with the
property deeds.
(j) Site Plan Requirements  Site plans are required for all
development, including single-family residences. Site
plans should be submitted to the Chief Building Inspector
or Planning Department of the City of Burlington for
approval. A permit will not be issued until the site plan is
approved. Site plans for development within the
Watershed Critical Area shall meet the following
requirements:
1) Five copies of site plans shall be submitted on 18
x 24 sheets.
2) Plan shall be to scale no smaller than 1 = 100.
3) Plan shall show the following:
? Title block (development name,
owner/developer, township, scale and tax map
number).
? Property lines.
32.2
31
? North arrow.

Boundaries  Where uncertainty exists as to the
boundaries of the watershed areas, as shown on the
Watershed Map, the following rules shall apply:
1) Where area boundaries are indicated as
approximately following either street, alley,
railroad or highway lines or centerlines thereof,
such lines shall be construed to be said
boundaries.
2) Where area boundaries are indicated as
approximately following lot lines, such lot lines
shall be construed to be said boundaries.
However, a surveyed plat prepared by a
registered land surveyor may be submitted to the
City as evidence that one or more properties along
these boundaries do not lie within the watershed
area.
32.2

SECTION 32.2A: WESTERN LOOP CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT
(Amendment creating district adopted June 3, 2003)
A. General Requirements: The following general requirements will apply to the
overlay district:
1. For the purposes of this ordinance, an overlay district is a district that
supplements the underlying zoning district established on the site. In
addition to the requirements of the underlying zoning district(s), the
requirements herein shall apply to all new construction, additions,
alterations or expansions to existing buildings, parking lots or vehicular
storage areas, unless explicitly exempted.
2. All uses permitted in the underlying zoning districts are allowed as
regulated by said districts.
3. The specific development requirements of a particular overlay district
shall apply uniformly to all property within said district.
B. Western Loop Corridor Overlay District Established: The Western Loop
Corridor Overlay District is hereby established as a corridor overlay district.
1. Boundaries of the Western Loop Corridor Overlay District: All parcels in
their entirety shall be included in the overlay if any portion of the lot is
located within 1,000 feet on either side of the centerline of the Western
Loop. In addition, when a proposed site plan is submitted containing
multiple lots and any portion of any lot located within the overall
development is within the boundaries of the overlay district, the entire
development will need to meet the requirements of this ordinance.
2. Applicability:
a. Application: The Western Loop Corridor Overlay District
regulations shall apply to all principal buildings on lots or open
uses of land constructed, reconstructed or established after the
effective date of this ordinance, June 3, 2003, except as exempted
or otherwise provided in Subsections B.2.b. and B.2.c. below.
32.2A
2
b. Exemptions: The Western Loop Corridor Overlay District
regulations shall not apply to:
(1) Single-family detached dwellings or two-family dwellings on
their own lots.
(2) A change in use that does not result in an increase of more
than one in the land use classification number.
(3) Those buildings and their accessory uses including parking
or vehicular storage areas existing on the effective date of
this ordinance, June 3, 2003, whose gross square footage of
building, parking area or open use of land is not expanded
in excess of 3,000 square feet of that which existed on the
effective date of this ordinance, June 3, 2003.
(4) Those projects that have an approved Site Specific
Development Plan in compliance with Section 32-A (Zoning
Vested Rights).
c. Expansion of Existing Uses: For those buildings, parking areas or
open uses of land that are expanded in excess of 3,000 square
feet of their gross square footage after the effective date of this
ordinance, June 3, 2003, the following requirements shall be met:
(1) Required planting yards shall be provided. In locations
where the entire width of the required planting yard cannot
be provided due to existing development, planting yards
shall be provided to the extent possible with no reduction in
the size or numbers of required plantings.
(2) Non-conforming signage shall comply with Section 1 of the
Western Loop Corridor Overlay District sign requirements.
C. Review Process: All development proposals within the Western Loop Corridor
Overlay shall submit a plan to the Technical Review Committee (TRC) to
check for compliance with this and any other applicable ordinances.
1. Development Plan  The applicant shall, at a minimum, submit plans
containing data and information consistent with all other applicable
provisions of this ordinance. In addition, the applicant shall submit
specific information to show that the project meets the standards
spelled out in the Design Standards portion of this ordinance.

5 ft. 4 ft.
Ground Level
2. Waiver of Overlay Requirements  The applicant shall have the option of
asking the TRC to waive certain aspects of this overlay if deemed
necessary. The applicant must show the TRC that the waiver is the
result of site specific condition and not the result of problems created by
the property owner and/or developer.
3. Land Use Classification  Several sections of this ordinance discuss a
Land Use Classification (LUC). The LUC is a tool in which each type of
use is given a number from one to five (one would equal a single-family
home, while a five might equal a junk yard). These different LUC
numbers are used to determine landscaping requirements between uses
and if a project must comply with this overlay. The LUC Table can be
found in Subsection E of this ordinance.
D. Design Standards: Developments shall comply with all applicable
requirements of this ordinance. In addition, the following design standards
shall be followed: (In the event of inconsistencies, the standards contained
in this section shall govern.)
1. Signs
a. Freestanding Signs (see Figure 1):
(1) Number - One freestanding sign shall be permitted per lot.
(2) Area - The area encompassed by the freestanding signs
shall not exceed 40 square feet.
(3) Height - No freestanding sign shall exceed five feet in height.
Figure 1
32.2A
4
b. Building Signs:
(1) The maximum total area of all allowable building signs shall
be equal to no more than ten percent of the area of the wall
of which such sign is a part or to which each such sign is
attached.
c. Total Sign Area and Number of Signs:
(1) The maximum aggregate of all allowable signs on each lot,
including freestanding, building or any other signs, shall be
equal to 100 square feet. When a zoning lot contains more
than one principal use, the entire lot shall be allowed 200
square feet of signage. The owner is responsible for
allocating sign space on the lot.
d. Signs shall be located such that there is at every street
intersection a clear view of sight distance between the heights of
three feet and ten feet, and all signs shall be located outside of the
right-of-way of any public street.
e. No animated sign or moving or flashing signs shall be permitted.
f. No portable signs shall be permitted.
g. No temporary signs shall be permitted.
h. No projecting or suspended signs shall be permitted.
i. No inflatable signs or tethered balloons shall be permitted.
j. No beacons shall be permitted.
k. No roof signs shall be permitted.
l. No off-premises advertising signs (billboards) shall be permitted.
m. Flags used as promotional devices of any type, including but not
limited to the promotion of goods, services, business
establishments, events, etc., shall be prohibited. National, state
and corporate flags may be flown.
32.2A
5
n. Computations:
(1) Computation of Area of Individual Signs  The area of the
sign face (that is also the sign area of a wall sign or other
sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the
smallest square, circle, rectangle or combination thereof
that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem or other display together with any
material or color forming an integral part of the background
of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the
backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not
including any supporting framework, bracing or decorative
fence or wall when such fence of wall otherwise meets the
Zoning Ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to
the display itself.
(2) Computations of Area of Multi-Faced Signs  The sign area
for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by
adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any
one point at the same time, and when such sign faces are
part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42
inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the
measurement of one of the faces.
(3) Computation of Height  The height of a sign shall be
computed as the distance from the base of the sign at
normal grade to the top of the highest attached component
of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower
of (1) existing grade prior to construction or (2) the newly
established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling,
berming, mounding or excavating. In cases where the
normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height
shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of
the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the
elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street
or grade of the land at the principal entrance to the
principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower.
(4) Computation of Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area for a
Lot  The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs
on a lot may not be more than 100 square feet in total,
except on lots with more than one principal use where the
maximum permitted sum of all signage can be 200 square
feet.
32.2A

2. Exterior Lighting Standards
a. Standards
The following standards are required of all exterior lighting except the
outdoor recreational uses specifically exempted below. Many uses have
the option of providing a lower light post with a non-cutoff type of
luminaire or a higher pole, up to 40 feet, with a luminaire that totally
cuts off light spillover at a cutoff angle smaller than 90 degrees.
The maximum height lightpost permitted is dependent upon the amount
of cutoff provided. This is designed as a protection against excessive
glare and light spilling over to neighboring properties. The exceptions
that are permitted provide adequate protection for highway corridors
and neighboring residential property.
Exterior lighting shall meet one of the following standards:
(1) When lighting source or luminaire has no cutoff:
Standard Maximum Permitted
Maintained
Illumination7
Maximum Permitted
Mounting Height of
Illumination8
Commercial Districts 0.20 footcandles 16 feet
Industrial Districts 0.30 footcandles 20 feet
7 Measured at the property line and any public right-of-way line.
8 Measured from the ground to the light source.
9 Footcandles (F) are to be calculated by dividing the lumens (L) by the distance to the
property line squared (4?D²) (i.e. F = L /4?D²)
where: L = intensity of the source (lumens)
D = distance between the source and the illuminated surface
(Amendment adopted June 17, 2014)
An illustration of this type of luminaire is provided below:
32.2A

8 Measured from the ground to the light source.
9 Footcandles (F) are to be calculated by dividing the lumens (L) by the distance to the
property line squared (4?D²) (i.e. F = L /4?D²)
where: L = intensity of the source (lumens)
D = distance between the source and the illuminated surface
(Amendment adopted May 19, 2014)
An illustration of this type of luminaire is provided below:
b. Exemption for specified outdoor recreational uses:
(1) These standards shall not apply to properties subject to
state or federal safe lighting standards.
(2) Because of their unique requirements for nighttime visibility
and their limited hours of operation, ballfields and tennis
courts are exempt from the exterior lighting standards
provided above. These outdoor recreational uses must meet
all other requirements of this overlay.
(3) The outdoor recreational uses specified above shall not
exceed a maximum permitted post height of 80 feet.
32.2A
8
c. Additional Regulations
Not withstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary:
(1) This section does not apply to public street lighting.
(2) No flickering or flashing lights shall be permitted.
(3) Adequate lighting must be provided for the public safety in
parking and similar areas.
d. Exterior Lighting Plan
At the time any exterior lighting is installed or substantially modified,
and whenever a zoning certificate is sought, an exterior lighting plan
shall be submitted to the Planning Department in order to determine
whether the requirements of this section have been met.
3. Access Management and Parking Areas
a. Standards
(1) Access points along the Western Loop to developments (such as
curb cuts or driveways) shall be minimized. No direct access
shall be permitted along the Western Loop when access may be
obtained along a side or an adjacent street. The following chart
lists the number of access points allowed based on road frontage
and type of lot:
Interior Lot (lot with only one side having road frontage)
0 - 350 feet 1 driveway
351 - 1,000 feet 2 driveways
More than 1,001 feet 3 driveways*
Corner Lot or Lot with Multiple Road Frontages
Access may be provided along any road except the Western Loop
onto which it fronts at the following rate:
0 - 350 feet 1 driveway
351 - 1,000 feet 2 driveways
More than 1,001 feet 3 driveways*
If the lot has more than 750 feet of road frontage along the
Western Loop and a Traffic Impact Anaylysis is performed by a
qualified engineer at the property owners expense that justifies
having an access point along the Western Loop, one access point
may be approved by the City Council.
32.2A
9
* Two driveways are the maximum number of driveways allowed
per street frontage for any parcel, tract or development, including
access to any and all properties designated as outparcels or to be
leased or sold for future development. The Planning Director may
recommend to the City Council for its approval three driveways
provided the parcel has at least 1,001 feet of frontage and a
Traffic Impact Analysis is performed by a qualified engineer at the
property owners expense justifying an additional driveway.
(2) All driveway approaches for both mid-block and corner lots
within this overlay district shall have both minimum corner and
side clearances as below:
Along Western Loop Along Side Street
Corner Clearance,
Ft.
250 150
Side Clearance, Ft. 30 10
(3) No access point shall be allowed within 10 feet of the side
property line of any property or development except where a
mutual access agreement exists between adjoining owners.
(4) All parcels containing more than one driveway must maintain a
minimum of 100 feet of separation between them.
(5) Shared driveways are permitted and recommended (see Figure 2).
Figure 2
32.2A
10
(6) Vehicular and pedestrian access between adjoining lots is
mandatory. Location and specifications for the interior lot
access points shall be determined during technical review
(see Figure 3). If at the time of construction the adjacent lot
or lots are not being developed, the developer must provide
stubouts to the adjacent lots. These stubouts will be
located in accordance with the TRCs recommendation and
provide for future access.
Figure 3
(7) The maximum coverage of front yard setback by a parking
lot and/or driveway shall be 20 percent.
Figure 4
32.2A
11
(8) Normal landscaping requirements as stated in Subsection
D(7) of this overlay will still apply to parking areas. In
addition, landscaped areas shall be surrounded by a
concrete curb or other material, such as landscape timbers,
in order to protect the landscaped area and to define its
borders.
(9) Any use or development that requires 100 or more off-street
parking spaces or that generates more than 60 trips during
the peak hours of 7 until 9 a.m., 11 a.m. until 1 p.m. and 4
until 6 p.m. through a single driveway may be required to
provide a deceleration lane. Data shall be based on the
Institute of Transportation Engineers' manual titled Trip
Generation and based upon the highest land use permitted
by the zoning classification.
(10) Any parcel of record on the effective date of this section that
has prohibited all vehicular access based on the provisions
herein shall be allowed one access point at a location
approved by the TRC.
4. Utility Wiring
a. Standards
(1) Wiring for utilities such as telephone, electrical, cable
television, etc., or related functions shall be placed under
ground.
5. Building Orientation

ZONING ORDINANCE
SECTION 32.7A: CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS
(Amendment creating district adopted June 3, 2003)
PURPOSE
The Conditional Zoning Districts allow for the establishment of certain uses that, because
of their nature or scale, have particular impacts on both the immediate area and the
community as a whole. The development of these uses cannot be predetermined or
controlled by general district standards. In order to accommodate these uses, this
section establishes specific development standards for these uses that allow for
flexibility in development while protecting existing developed areas. The permitted
uses and development standards are contained within each district. The process for
approval of a Conditional Zoning District is explained in Section 32.19:F of the City of
Burlington Zoning Ordinance.
A. CONDITIONAL RESIDENTIAL (CR) DISTRICT
1. Purpose.
The Conditional Residential (CR) District is hereby established in order to
accommodate the development of planned residential communities that may
incorporate all the uses indicated in the CR column of the Table of Permitted
Uses, Section 32. 9, and subject to such conditions as may be referred to in
the Special Requirements column of said table. This Conditional Zoning
District is intended to serve development that is ripe and not of a
speculative nature.
2. Development Standards.
All specific development standards for the general R-9 Zoning District found
within the City of Burlington Zoning Ordinance, City of Burlington
Subdivision Regulations and any other accepted/adopted policies of the City
of Burlington must be met. However, petitioners requesting a rezoning to a
Conditional Residential Zoning District may place additional requirements
and standards onto themselves and their property or ask that certain
standards identified in the request for rezoning be decreased. It shall be the
City Council's final decision to grant approval or denial of the rezoning in
light of the increased or decreased development standards presented to the
Council. If no specific request is made by the petitioner to change the
development standards or if the petition to rezone is silent on this point, it
shall be understood that the general R-9 Zoning District standards shall
apply.

may incorporate all the uses indicated in the COI column of the Table of
Permitted Uses, Section 32. 9, and subject to such conditions as may be
referred to in the Special Requirements column of said table. This
Conditional Zoning District is intended to serve development that is ripe
and not of a speculative nature.
2. Development Standards.
All specific development standards for a general O-I Zoning District found
within the City of Burlington Zoning Ordinance, City of Burlington
Subdivision Regulations and any other accepted/adopted policies of the City
of Burlington must be met. However, petitioners requesting a rezoning to a
Conditional Office-Institutional Zoning District may place additional
requirements and standards onto themselves and their property or ask that
certain standards identified in the request for rezoning be decreased. It shall
be the City Council's final decision to grant approval or denial of the
rezoning in light of the increased or decreased development standards
presented to the Council. If no specific request is made by the petitioner to
change the development standards or if the petition to rezone is silent on this
point, it shall be understood that the general O-I Zoning District standards
shall apply.

1. Purpose.
The Conditional Business (CB) District is hereby established in order to
accommodate the development of planned commercial developments that
may incorporate all the uses indicated in the CB column of the Table of
Permitted Uses, Section 32.9, and subject to such conditions as may be

2. Development Standards.
All specific development standards for a general B-2 Zoning District found
with the City of Burlington Zoning Ordinance, City of Burlington Subdivision
Regulations and any other accepted/adopted policies of the City of
Burlington must be met. However, petitioners requesting a rezoning to a
Conditional Business Zoning District may place additional requirements and

E. CONDITIONAL MIXED USE ZONING DISTRICT (CMX-Residential and
CMX-Commercial)
1. Purpose.
Two Mixed Use Districts are hereby established in order to accommodate the
development of planned communities that may incorporate a full range of
housing types and compatible non-residential uses that provide goods,
services and employment. In order to encourage high quality design and
innovative arrangement of buildings and open space uses throughout the
project, these districts provide substantial flexibility from the conventional
use and dimensional requirements of the general districts. Two Mixed Use
Districts are established with varying degrees of development intensity to
address the application of Mixed Use to various locations within the
community. The developmental and locational criteria for the districts are as
follows:
a. CMX-Residential (CMX-R): This district permits Residential Mixed Use
development (dwellings and permitted accessory uses and structures)
on tracts that are 10 acres or larger and Residential Mixed Use and
nonresidential use development on tracts that are 30 acres or larger.
This district is permitted within the community along major
thoroughfares, minor thoroughfares or collector streets having
adequate access.
b. CMX-Commercial (CMX-C): This district permits major commercial,
institutional and employment uses with a mix of residential uses. This
district is applicable to developments 50 acres or larger. It is
intended to be located along major thoroughfares.
2. Uses permitted by right.
The following uses shall be permitted by right in the CMX-Residential and
CMX-Commercial Districts provided that they meet all requirements of this
part and all other requirements of these regulations:
a. The CMX-Residential District shall allow for any use as indicated in the
CMX-R column of the Table of Permitted Uses, Section 32. 9, and
subject to such conditions as may be referred to in the Special
Requirements column of said table provided that no more than 10
percent of the total project acreage is dedicated for commercial uses.
32.7A
4
b. The CMX-Commercial District shall allow for any use indicated in the
CMX-C column of the Table of Permitted Use, Section 32. 9, and
subject to such conditions as may be referred to in the Special
Requirements column of said table provided that no less than 15
percent of the total project acreage is dedicated for residential uses.
3. Development standards for CMX-Residential and CMX-Commercial Districts.
In general, if a development standard is not listed in these regulations, the
requirements of the general use zoning district for the appropriate Mixed
Use District shall apply. For example, a development standard for a CMXResidential
development shall follow the requirements of an R-6 or B-1
general zoning district standard if it is not explained below.
a. All uses and structures in the CMX Districts shall meet the
development standards established in this ordinance and the
following:
(1) The minimum total project area for development in a Mixed Use
District must be as follows:
CMX-Residential - 10 acres for exclusive residential
CMX-Residential - 30 acres for a mix of residential
and commercial
CMX-Commercial - 50 acres
(2) Residential development within the CMX Districts shall meet the
minimum lot area, lot width, and yard requirements established
for the R-6 District for single-family development and the MF-A
District for attached and multifamily development.
(3) Non-residential development within the CMX Districts shall
meet the minimum lot area, lot width and yard requirements
established for the B-1 District. In no event shall non-residential
development in a CMX District exceed a floor-area ratio of 0.75
(for each one square foot of land, .75 square feet of building
may be built).
32.7A
5
b. Density limitations.
(1) Residential development in CMX Districts shall not exceed the
maximum residential density indicated in the table below. The
calculation of maximum density shall be based on the total
project area minus any portion of the total project area to be
devoted to non-residential uses. For the purpose of this
calculation, public rights-of-way shall be deemed to be a
residential use.
Table
Maximum dwelling units per acre
CMX-Residential 8.0
CMX-Commercial 10.0
(2) Each phase of a multi-phase project within a CMX District
should be able to stand as an independent project. At no point
in the development of a multi-phase project shall the density of
residential development in a completed phase of the project
area exceed the approved maximum density established by this
section.
(3) At least 70 percent of the dwelling units in a CMX-Residential
District shall be detached dwellings.
c. Common open space; density bonus.
(1) At least 10 percent of the total project area shall be set aside as
common open space.
(2) A density bonus over and above the density otherwise allowed
in the CMX District may be approved by the City Council
provided that the petitioner increases the percentage of the
total project area to be devoted to common open space. This
bonus may be granted only if specifically requested by the
petitioner. Any such bonus shall consist of a one percent
increase in the allowable density for every one percent of land
area devoted to common open space in addition to the 10
percent required under subsection (1) above, but in no event
shall the bonus exceed 35 percent of the allowable density set
out in the density table.
32.7A
6
(3) All common open space shall be set aside and improved no
later than the date on which Certificates of Occupancy are
issued for the first 75 percent of the total number of dwelling
units to be constructed within the project area.
(4) No more than 50 percent of all required common open space
shall be covered by water.
(5) Any structures located in any common open space shall be
accessory to recreational use of the space and shall cover no
more than five percent of all common open space.
(6) The required common open space shall be planned and
improved so that it is accessible and usable by persons living in
the project area. However, common open space containing
natural features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved.
(7) All of the required common open space shall be either
conveyed to the City of Burlington if the City agrees to accept
ownership of and to maintain the space or conveyed to one or
more homeowners' associations created for the project area or
with respect to outdoor recreation facilities, to the owner or
operator thereof.

subdivision plat for the project area is recorded. The covenants
and easements shall provide for the establishment of a
homeowners' association before any homes are sold. Where
membership is mandatory for each homebuyer and any
successive buyer, the association is responsible for liability
insurance and local taxes on common open space and
recreational facilities owned by it. Any fees levied by the
association that remain unpaid will become a lien on the
individual property, and the association shall be able to adjust
the assessment to meet changing needs. The covenants and
easements shall also prohibit future development of any
common open space for other than open space or recreation
purposes and shall provide for continued maintenance of any
common open space and recreational facilities.

5. Use Restriction: Not withstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, no use may be
made of land or water within any zone established by this ordinance in such a manner as
to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication
between the airport and aircraft making it difficult for pilots to distinguish between
airport lights and others resulting in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair
visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way
endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft intending to
use the airport.
6. Permits: No permits for the construction of a building or structure, the expansion of a
building or structure or use of land shall be issued within an APA, APH or APT area
until it has been determined that the proposal upon which a request is made is in
compliance with the terms of these regulations.

APT area shall be permitted to grow to an elevation that exceeds the height restrictions
as outlined in Section 32.8:A.4 of this ordinance.
8. Non-Conforming Uses:
1. Regulations Not Retroactive: The regulations prescribed by this ordinance shall not
be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or alterations of any
structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this
ordinance or otherwise interfere with the continuance of non-conforming use.
Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction or alteration of
which was begun prior to the effective date of this ordinance and is diligently
prosecuted.
32.8
5
2. Obstruction  Marking and Lighting: Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
section, the owner of any existing non-conforming structure or tree is hereby
required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Airport Authority to indicate
to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport
obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at
the expense of the Airport Authority.
3. Non-Conforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed: Whenever the Chief Inspector
determines that a non-conforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than
75 percent torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted
that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limits or
otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
9. Variances: Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure or permit
the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed
in this ordinance may apply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance from such
regulations. (See Section 32.15.)
The application for variance shall be accomplished by a determination from the Federal
Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation
facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be
allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations
will result in unnecessary hardship and relief, if granted; will not create a hazard to air
navigation; will do substantial justice; and will be in accordance with the spirit of this
ordinance. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this ordinance
may be considered by the Board of Adjustment unless a copy of this application has been
furnished to the Airport Manager and/or the Airport Authority for advice as the
aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Airport Manager and/or Airport Authority does
not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the Board of Adjustment may
act on its own to grant or deny said application.
10. Obstruction Marking and Lighting: Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is
deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this ordinance and be reasonable in the
circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in
question to install, operate and to maintain, at the owners expense, such markings and
lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the Board of Adjustment, this condition
may be modified to require the owner to permit Burlington-Alamance Airport Authority at
its own expense to install, operate and maintain the necessary markings and lights.
32.8

B. Lot Coverage and Open Space:
1. Computation of Lot Coverages: All buildings and improvements extending five feet or
more above ground level shall be included in the computation of lot coverage.
2. Computation of Percent of Lot in Open Space: Land required to be provided in open
space shall be unobstructed except by plants, play equipment and lawn furniture, except
terraces and walkways may be included in the computation of open space. Parking and
driving areas shall not be included in the computation of such space.
C. Measurement of Building Height: Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, the height
of a building shall be the vertical distance from the mean elevation of the finished grade
along the front of the building or from the established grade where the building is within ten
feet of the street line to the highest point of flat roof; to the deck line of a mansard roof; or, to
the mean height level between eaves and ridge for gable, hip and gambrel roofs.
D. Exceptions to Height Limit: Height limitation shall not apply to belfries, chimneys, church
spires, cupolas, domes, flagpoles, flues, monuments, television masts, transmission lines and
similar structures. Where such structures may be deemed by the Building Inspector to
interfere with aerial navigation, a variance for the height and location shall be required from
the Board of Adjustment in collaboration with proper aeronautical authorities.
Height limitations shall not apply to a parapet wall extending four feet or less above the
height limit of the building upon which they rest, nor to bulkheads, elevators, one-story
penthouses, water tanks or other similar structures, provided such structures shall not have
an aggregate area greater than 25 percent of the roof area. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to be a part of the AIRPORT HEIGHT RESTRICTIVE AREA or used in determining
heights in the AIRPORT HEIGHT RESTRICTIVE AREA. (Amendment adopted May 19, 1998)

No. 501A, a copy of which is on file in the Building Inspectors office.
14. Site Planning: It is the intent of this ordinance that mobile home parks
shall be permitted as a Special Use only upon evidence that a desirable
environment for family living will result. To this end, consideration will be
given to amenities of the site plan such as the degree of privacy afforded to
each unit, protection from adjacent commercial and industrial activities,
recreational facilities, landscaping and avoidance of traffic congestion.
Placing mobile homes side by side with their long axes parallel should be
avoided unless the distances between them are substantially increased

27
1. Setback and Height Requirements: No telecommunications tower may
be permitted on a site unless the minimum distance from the base of
the tower to the nearest property line shall be equal to or greater than the
height of the tower. City Council shall have the option to waive this
provision upon receiving documentation from the petitioner that the tower
is engineered such that in the event of collapse, the tower will fall upon
itself within the property boundaries upon which it is located. This
option may require the establishment of a setback equivalent to a fall
zone easement certified by a Professional Engineer registered in North
Carolina. The minimum setback for a tower and all appurtenant
structures shall be 25 feet from the nearest property line. Where towers
are located adjacent to residentially-zoned property, the minimum
setback from such property lines shall be twice the height of the tower.
However, in the case of monopole towers, the minimum distance from
adjoining residential property shall be the height of the tower or 75 feet,
whichever is greater.
2. Appurtenant Structures for Tower Operations: An appurtenant
structure constructed for the express purpose of housing equipment related
to tower operations may accompany each tower. Such structures shall be
unmanned and be limited to 400 feet gross floor space. Setback for these
structures shall be at least five feet from any property line.
3. Power Output and EMF Emissions: The output power for towers shall not
exceed federally-approved levels for exposure to electronic magnet force
(EMF). The petitioner shall certify that the tower operations will not
interfere with normal radio and television reception in the vicinity.
Towers shall be provided with warning lights pursuant to Federal Aviation
Administration and Federal Communications Commission guidelines.
4. Minimum Distance Between Towers: Towers established pursuant to
this ordinance and greater than 75 feet in height shall be located no
closer than 1,000 feet from another tower greater than 75 feet in height.
5. Co-Location and Conformance with Telecommunications Plan: The colocation
of telecommunications operations on towers shall be encouraged.
Towers not exceeding 150 feet in height shall be adequately designed and
of sufficient height to accommodate at least one additional user. Towers
greater than 150 feet in height shall be designed to accommodate
multiple additional users.
Where new tower sites are proposed, vendors shall provide documentary
evidence that their telecommunications needs cannot be met by existing
towers through co-location. Vendors shall also demonstrate that proposed
new towers are consistent with the City of Burlington Comprehensive
Telecommunications Plan.

SS. Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC): (Amendment approving
section adopted April 6, 1999)
1. Purpose: The purpose of Continuing Care Retirement Communities is
to encourage the development of appropriate and adequate housing
communities for the elderly. Recognizing that the elderly have special
housing, medical and other needs and that elderly housing and related
accessory uses have a less intense impact on the community than
traditional housing types, Continuing Care Retirement Communities
shall be allowed by Conditional rezoning in accordance with the
following provisions that depart from the strict application of
conventional use, density and dimensional requirements of the
Residential, Multifamily and Office-Institutional zoning districts. Use of
the CCRC procedure is not mandatory for the development of any parcel
of ground. Rather, the process will provide a voluntary alternative
development procedure that will: (Amendment adopted June 3, 2003)
a. Permit creative approaches to development of a retirement center
reflecting changes in the technological methods of treatment
and/or development.
b. Accomplish a more desirable environment than would otherwise
be possible and providing a variety of housing types, design and
arrangement.
c. Provide for an efficient use of land that can result in smaller
networks of utilities and streets and thereby lowering costs.
d. Enhance the appearance of neighborhoods through the
preservation of natural features, the provision of underground
utilities and the provision of open-space areas.
e. Provide an environment of stable character that is compatible
with surrounding residential areas and other adjacent land uses,
the general development plan, existing and proposed topography
and utilities.
2. Development Plan: A development plan must be submitted at the time of
Conditional rezoning application and must demonstrate that the proposed
CCRC, while departing from the strict application of the conventional
district requirements, is in keeping with the intent of this ordinance.

ZONING ORDINANCE
SECTION 32.11: OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
A. General Provisions
1. Scope of Regulations: The off-street parking and loading provisions of
this ordinance shall apply as follows:
a. For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date of this ordinance, accessory
parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required by the
regulations of the districts in which such buildings or uses are
located and in accordance with the amounts specified in Section
32.11, Paragraph C, Off-Street Parking Space, and Section
32.11, Paragraph D, Off-Street Loading. However, where a
building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this
ordinance, and provided that construction is begun within 30
days from such effective date and diligently prosecuted to
completion, parking and loading facilities in the amounts required
for issuance of said building permit may be provided in lieu of any
different amounts required by this ordinance.
b. When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through addition of dwelling units, gross floor
area, seating capacity or other units of measurement specified
herein for required parking and loading facilities, parking and
loading facilities as required herein shall be provided for such
increase in intensity of use. However, no building or structure
lawfully erected for a use lawfully established prior to the effective
date of this ordinance shall be required to provide such additional
parking or loading facilities unless and until the aggregate
increase in unit of measurement shall equal not less than 15
percent of the units of measurement existing upon the effective
date of this ordinance in which event, parking or loading facilities
as required herein shall be provided for the total increase.
c. Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall
hereafter be changed to a new use, parking and loading facilities
shall be provided as required for such new use.
2. Existing Parking Facilities: Accessory off-street parking facilities in
existence on the effective date of this ordinance and located on the same
lot as the building or use served shall not hereafter be reduced below, or
if already less than, shall not be further reduced below the requirements
for a similar new building or use under the provisions of this ordinance.
32.11
1
3. Permissive Parking and Loading Facilities: Nothing in this ordinance
shall be deemed to prohibit the voluntary establishment of off-street
parking or loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or
buildings, provided that all regulations herein governing the location,
design and operation of such facilities are adhered to.
4. Damage or Destruction: For any conforming and legally non-conforming
building or use that is in existence on the effective date of this
ordinance that subsequently thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire,
collapse, explosion or other cause and that is reconstructed, reestablished
or repaired, off-street parking or loading facilities need not
be provided, except that parking or loading facilities equivalent to any
maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be restored
or continued in operation. However, in no case shall it be necessary to
restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those
required by this ordinance for equivalent new uses or construction.
5. Control of Off-Site Parking Facilities: In cases where parking facilities
are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on which the building or
use served is located, such facilities shall be in the same possession as
the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the parking
facilities are accessory. Such possession may either be under fee simple
title or under long-term lease  the term of such lease to be approved as
adequate by the Board of Adjustment.
6. Submission of Plot Plan: Any application for a building permit or for a
Certificate of Occupancy where no building permit is required shall
include therewith as plot plan  drawn to scale and fully dimensioned 
showing any parking or loading facilities to be provided in compliance
with this ordinance.
B. Parking Requirements for All Districts: Off-street parking facilities accessory
to uses allowed in all districts shall be provided in accordance with the
regulations set forth hereinafter, as well as in Section 32.11, Paragraphs A, C
and D.

trucks when use permits are granted, required accessory off-street
parking facilities provided for uses listed herein shall be solely for the
parking of passenger automobiles of patrons, occupants or employees of
such uses. However, the parking of trucks accessory to a permitted
non-residential use, if limited to 1 ½ ton capacity, is permitted.
32.11
2
2. Exemption: On lots of record as of the effective date of this ordinance
that are 33 feet or less in width, that are to be improved with a singlefamily
dwelling and for which no alley has been dedicated to the rear,
accessory parking facilities shall not be required.
3. Computation: When determination of the number of off-street parking
spaces required by this ordinance results in a requirement of a
fractional space, any fraction of ½ or less may be disregarded, while a
fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.
4. Collective Provision: Off-street parking facilities for separate uses may
be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not
less than the sum of the separate requirements for each such use and
provided that all regulations governing location of accessory parking
spaces in relation to the use served are adhered to. Further, no parking
space or portion thereof shall serve as a required space for more than
one use unless otherwise authorized by the Board of Adjustment in
accordance with Section 32.15.
5. Size: A required off-street parking space shall be at least eight feet  six
inches in width and at least 20 feet in length, exclusive of access drives
or aisles, ramps, columns or office or work areas. Such space shall
have a vertical clearance of at least six feet  six inches measured at
right angles to the axis of the vehicle. Aisles shall be not less than 20
feet wide for 90-degree parking, 18 feet wide for 60-degree parking, 12

parallel parking. For parallel parking, the length of the parking space
shall be increased to 23 feet.
6. Access: Each required off-street parking space shall open directly upon
an aisle or driveway (other than a public right-of-way) of such width and
design as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to such
parking space. All off-street parking facilities shall be designed with
appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner
that will least interfere with traffic movement.
7. Design and Maintenance:
a. Lighting  Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas
shall be directed away from residential properties and public
streets.
b. Signs  Accessory signs shall be permitted on parking areas in
accordance with the provisions specified under each zoning
district in Section 32.12.
32.11
3
c. Repair and Service  No motor vehicle repair work or service of
any kind shall be permitted in conjunction with parking facilities
provided in residential districts of any kind except washing of
vehicles by resident owner and emergency repair service required
to start vehicle. In a B-1 or B-3 Districts, no motor vehicle repair
work or service of any kind shall be permitted in conjunction with
parking facilities provided therein unless such accessory parking
facilities are enclosed in a building.
8. Location: All parking spaces required for uses that are established after
the effective date of this ordinance shall be located on the same lot as
the building or use served. Uses that are in existence on the effective
date of this ordinance and that are subsequently altered or enlarged so
as to require the provision of parking facilities located on land other
than the lot on which the building or use served is located, provided
that such facilities are located within 400 feet walking distance of a
main entrance to the use served.
9. Similar Uses: On receiving an application for a zoning permit for a use

BURLINGTON, NC
ZONING ORDINANCE
SECTION 32.11A: LANDSCAPING
(Amendment creating new language effective November 1, 2004)
1. Purpose and Scope
a. This section establishes minimum standards for the design of landscapes
for uses other than single-family and two-family residential dwellings in
order to improve Burlington and its planning area aesthetically,
economically and environmentally. This section should improve the
appearance of the community through the provision of and the
preservation of trees in order to better control soil erosion; reduce the
hazards of flooding; stabilize the groundwater tables; absorb carbon
dioxide; supply oxygen; provide shade for cooling; screen noise, dust,
glare; and preserve, protect and enhance the natural environment.
b. The planting yard regulations are intended to minimize potential conflicts
between abutting developments. The purpose of planting yards is to
ensure that a natural area of appropriate size and density of plantings is
located between zoning districts and/or trees.
2. Definitions
Caliper. A standard trunk diameter measurement for nursery-grown trees taken
six inches above the ground for up to and including four-inch caliper size and
12 inches above the ground for larger sizes.
Critical Root Zone (CRZ). A circular region measured outward from a tree trunk
representing the essential area of the roots that must be maintained in order for
the trees survival. The critical root zone is one foot of radial distance for every
inch of tree DBH, with a minimum of eight feet.
DBH. Diameter at breast height is the tree trunk diameter measured in inches
at a height of 4.5 feet above the ground.
Deciduous. Those plants that annually lose their leaves.
32.11A
1
Drip line. A vertical line extending from the outermost edge of the tree canopy or
shrub branch to the ground.
Evergreen. Those plants that retain foliage throughout the year.
Evergreen screen. A plant growing to over 20 feet in height at maturity that
retains foliage year round and is planted to provide a dense vegetative screen for
purposes of visual mitigation between zoning districts or differing property uses.
3. Applicability
a. Exemptions: These requirements shall not apply to:
(1) Single-family detached dwellings or two-family dwellings on their
own lots;
(2) Multifamily developments containing eight or fewer dwelling units
on a single zoning (building) lot;
(3) Properties within or surrounded by the Central Business (B-3)
zoning district;
(4) Property lines abutting railroad rights-of-way and utility easements
in excess of 60 feet in width; and,
(5) Property lines abutting dedicated street right-of-way that has
remained unopened for a period of at least 15 years.
b. Application: These requirements shall apply to the following:
(1) New Principal Building or Use: Principal buildings or open uses of
land constructed or established after the adoption of this ordinance.
(2) Changes in Use: Changes in use that result in an increase of two or
more in the Land Use Classification number. The requirements of
this section shall be applicable to the entire zone lot.
(3) Expansions or Reconstruction: Expansions that will result in a
parking or building square footage increases of more than 3,000
square feet for developments existing on the effective date of this
ordinance. In such cases, the landscaping requirements shall
apply only to the expansion.
32.11A
2
(4) Publicly-Owned Buildings: Publicly-owned buildings, municipal or
other utility structures and installations, parks and open air uses,
but not including utility rights-of-way or easements.
c. Reduction in Parking Requirements for Pre-Existing Developments: To
allow compliance with the landscaping regulations, the number of
required off-street parking spaces may be reduced by up to 10 percent.
4. Planting Yards
a. Required Planting Areas: The following areas are required to be
landscaped:
(1) Street planting yards;
(2) Parking lots (excluding vehicle loading, storage and display areas);
and,
(3) Side and rear yards (referred to as Type A, B, C and D planting
yards).
b. Planting Area Descriptions:
(1) Street Planting Yard: A planting area parallel to a public street
designed to provide continuity of vegetation along the right-of-way
and a pleasing view from the road. No more than 15% percent of
the street planting yard may be used for walkways or signs.
Parking, merchandise display and off-street loading are prohibited
in the street planting yard.
(2) Parking Lot Plantings: Planting areas within and adjacent to
parking areas designed to shade and improve the attractiveness of
large areas of pavement.
(3) Type A Planting Yard: A high-density screen intended to block
substantially visual contact between adjacent uses and create
spatial separation. A Type A Planting Yard reduces lighting and
noise that would otherwise intrude upon adjacent uses.
(4) Type B Planting Yard: A medium-density screen intended to
partially block visual contact between uses and create spatial
separation.
32.11A
3
(5) Type C Planting Yard: A low-density screen intended to partially
block visual contact between uses and create spatial separation.
(6) Type D Planting Yard: A peripheral planting strip intended to
separate uses, provide vegetation in densely developed areas and
enhance the appearance of individual properties.
5. Planting Yard Determination
To determine the planting yards required by this ordinance, take the following
steps:
a. Identify the classification of the proposed or expanded land use and of any
existing or proposed adjacent land use(s) by using the Land Use
Classification Table found at the end of this section. A land use is an
existing use on an adjacent property when a building permit is issued. If
a zone lot contains uses with different land use classification, select the
higher numbered classification; then,
b. Use the Planting Yard Chart to determine the appropriate letter
designation for each planting yard; then,
c. Match the letter designation obtained from the Planting Yard Chart with
the Planting Rate Chart to determine the types and numbers of shrubs
and trees required:

6. Landscaping Design and Maintenance Standards
a. Calculation of Street Planting Yards: Street planting yard rate and width
calculations shall exclude access drives.
b. Plant Species: Species used in required street planting yards, parking lots
and planting yards shall be of a locally adapted nature.
c. Dimension of Planting Areas: Each planting area containing trees,
including those located in parking lots, shall have a minimum inside
dimension of five feet and be at least 200 square feet in area.
d. Grouping: For the Type B, C and D planting yards, shrubs and trees may
be grouped or clustered; however, not more than 50 percent of each
required plant material may be grouped or clustered. The remainder of
the materials shall be distributed throughout the planting yard. There
shall be at least one row of evergreen shrubs or evergreen understory
trees in all Type A planting yards.
32.11A
6
e. Parking Lot Spacing: Required canopy tree areas shall be distributed
throughout parking lots and shall be located within or adjacent to parking
lots as tree islands, at the end of parking bays, inside medians or between
rows of parking spaces. Trees located within planting yards cannot be
credited toward the parking lot landscaping requirements.
f. Canopy Tree Size: Canopy trees must be a minimum of eight feet high
and two inches in caliper and measured six inches above grade when
planted. When mature, a canopy tree should be at least 40 feet high and
have a crown width of 30 feet or greater.
g. Understory Tree Size: Understory trees must be a minimum of four feet
high and one inch in caliper and measured six inches above grade when
planted. When mature, an understory tree should be between 15 and 40
feet high.
h. Shrub Size: All shrubs shall be expected to reach a minimum height of
36 inches and a minimum spread of 30 inches within three years of
planting. The minimum planting size shall be 18 inches in height or
spread.
i. Berm Size: Any berm shall have a minimum height of three feet, a
minimum crown width of three feet and a side slope no greater than 3:1.
j. Wall Planters: Wall planters shall be constructed of masonry, stone or
pressure-treated lumber stamped for ground contact (AWPB LP-22 1980
or equivalent). The minimum height of the wall planter shall be 30
inches. The minimum height of shrubs in the wall planter shall be six
inches. The effective planting area of the wall planter shall be four feet in
width. If the wall planter is to contain trees, the effective planting width
shall be seven inches.
k. Encroachments Permitted in Required Planting Yards: The following are
permitted in required planting yards provided there is no interference
with any sight area:
(1) Landscaping features, including but not limited to ornamental
pools, planting boxes, sculpture, arbors, trellises and birdbaths.
(2) Pet shelters, at-grade patios, play equipment, outdoor furniture,
ornamental entry columns and gates, flag poles, lamp posts,
address posts, HVAC equipment, mailboxes, outdoor fire places,
public utility wires and poles, pumps, wells, fences, retaining walls
or similar structures.
32.11A
7
(3) Cornices, steps, canopies overhanging eaves and gutters, window
sills, bay windows or similar architectural features, chimneys and
fire places, fire escapes, fire balconies and fire towers may project
not more than two and one-half feet into any required planting
yard, but in no case shall be closer than three feet to any property
line.
l. Setback Less Than Planting Yard: If the required building setback is less
than the required planting yard width, the building setback shall control,
reducing the required planting yard width only along side the building.
The planting rate of the required planting yard shall still apply.
m. Location of Planting Material Outside Shade of Building: Where a building
is located less than ten feet from a property line and the planting yard
would be heavily shaded by buildings on both sides of the property line,
the required trees and shrubs may be planted outside the shaded area to
improve survivability.
n. Obstructions: Landscaping shall not obstruct the view of motorists using
any street, driveway or parking aisle.
o. Location: Required trees and shrubs shall not be installed in street
rights-of-way. Required trees and shrubs may be placed:
(1) in water quality conservation easements;
(2) in electric utility easements below overhead lines; and,
(3) in drainage maintenance and utility easements.
p. Plant Protection: Whenever planting areas are adjacent to parking lots or
drives, the planting areas shall be protected from damage by vehicles,
lubricants or fuels.
q. Maintenance: The owner is responsible for maintaining all required plant
materials and planting areas in good health and appearance. Any dead,
unhealthy or missing plants must be replaced within 180 days with
vegetation that conforms to the initial planting rates and standards.
When plant material is severely damaged due to unusual weather
conditions or other acts of God, the owner shall have two years to replant.
32.11A
8
7. Procedures
a. Landscaping Plan Required: Before obtaining a grading permit or a
building permit, an applicant must receive approval of a landscaping plan
from the Technical Review Committee. The landscaping plan must have
been prepared in accordance with the Citys requirements.
b. Installation of Plant Materials
(1) Installation of plant material shall occur before issuance of a
Certificate of Compliance.
(2) If at the time of a request for a Certificate of Compliance the
required planting areas are not complete and it can be determined
that: (a) plant materials are unavailable; (b) completion of the
planting areas would jeopardize the health of the plant materials;
or, (c) weather conditions prohibit completion of the planting areas,
then the Enforcement Officer may defer the installation of plant
materials. The developer shall submit a copy of a signed contract
for installation of the required planting areas, and the developer
may be required to post a surety equal to the amount of the
contract. In no instance shall the surety be for a period greater than
180 days. The Enforcement Officer may issue a temporary
Certificate of Compliance but shall not issue a Certificate of
Compliance until the planting areas have been completed and
approved.
8. Alternate Methods of Complying
a. General Provisions:
(1) Alternate landscaping plans, plant materials or planting methods
may be used where impractical situations would result from
application or landscaping requirements. Such situations may
result from utility easements, streams, natural rock formations,
topography, lot configuration or where other physical conditions
exist or where other site conditions exist such as unified
development design or other unusual site conditions.
(2) The Enforcement Officer may approve an alternate plan that
proposes different plant materials, planting yard widths or methods
provided that quality, effectiveness, durability and performance are
equivalent to that required by this ordinance.
32.11A
9
(3) The performance of alternate landscaping plans must be reviewed
by the Enforcement Officer to determine if the alternate plan meets
the intent and purpose of this ordinance. This determination shall
take into account the land use classification of adjacent property,
number of plantings, species, arrangement and coverage, location
of plantings on the lot and the level of screening, height, spread and
canopy of the plantings at maturity.
(4) Decisions of the Enforcement Officer regarding alternate methods of
compliance may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.
b. Lot of Record Provisions: For zone lots less than 100 feet in width, the
following provisions may be applied:
(1) For zone lots less than 100 feet and greater than 80 in width where
Type D Planting Yards are required, one Type D Planting Yard may
be eliminated from the landscaping plan if the Enforcement Officer
finds that strict application of the requirements of this section
prevents reasonable use of the property. However, the plantings
required for this yard shall be installed in remaining planting yards.
(2) For zone lots less than 80 feet in width where Type D Planting
Yards are required, two Type D Planting Yards may be eliminated
from the landscaping plan if the Enforcement Officer finds that
strict application of the requirements of this section prevents
reasonable use of the property. All required plants for these yards
shall be installed in remaining planting yards.
9. Provisions for Preserving Existing Trees
a. General: Any existing tree or group of trees that stands within or near a
required planting area and meets or exceeds the standards of this
ordinance may be used to satisfy the tree requirements of the planting
area. Protection of tree stands, rather than individual trees, is strongly
encouraged.
b. Protection of Existing Trees: To receive credit, trees must be protected
from direct and indirect root damage and trunk and crown disturbance.
The following standards shall apply:
(1) The protected area around trees shall include all land within the
canopy drip line.
(2) Construction site activities such as parking, material storage, soil
stock piling and concrete washout shall not be permitted within
tree protection areas.
32.11A
10
(3) Protective fencing shall be installed around tree protection areas
prior to any land disturbance. Such fences shall be at least four
feet high and may consist of snow fence or polyethylene safety
fencing. Fencing shall remain in place until construction is
complete and other landscaping has been installed.
c. Dead or Unhealthy Trees: No credit will be allowed for any dead tree, any
tree in poor health or any tree subjected to grade alterations. The death
of any tree used for preservation credit shall require the owner to plant
new trees equal to the number of credited trees.
d. Rate of Credit: Credits shall be allowed at the rate of one canopy tree for
every three inches of circumference measured at four and one-half feet
above grade. Credits shall be subtracted from the total number of canopy
and understory trees required in the same planting yards where the tree
is located. In every case, however, there shall be at least one canopy tree
for every 50 linear feet of street planting yard, existing or planted.

BURLINGTON, N. C.
ZONING ORDINANCE
SECTION 32.13: SPECIAL USE REGULATIONS
A. Purpose: Special Use Permits add flexibility to the Zoning Ordinance.
Subject to high standards of planning and design, certain property uses are
allowed in the several districts where these uses would not otherwise be
acceptable. By means of controls exercised through the Special Use Permit
procedure, property uses that would otherwise be undesirable in certain
districts can be developed to minimize any ill effects they might have on
surrounding properties.
Other sections of this chapter set forth the uses that may be established, as
a matter of right, in each of the districts and specify various lot dimensions
and space requirements that must accompany each established use. Some
land uses, however, have a particular impact on the surrounding area that
cannot be predetermined and controlled by general regulations. In order to
insure that these uses, in their proposed locations, would be compatible with
surrounding development, their establishment shall not be as a matter or
right but only after review and approval as hereafter provided.
B. Administration of Special Use Regulations: (Amendment adopted June 3,
2003)
The uses for which Special Use Permits are required are listed in this section
along with requirements for submission. Uses specified in this section shall
be permitted only upon issuance of a Special Use Permit.
Such Special Use Permit shall not be valid, and no building permit issued
thereon, until it has been fully executed and recorded in the office of the
Burlington City Clerk.
1. Special Use Permits Issued by the Board of Adjustment:
a. A Special Use Permit may be issued by the Board of Adjustment
for those uses so indicated in this section. The application for a
Special Use Permit shall accompany or precede the application for
a building permit and/or a Certificate of Occupancy, where such
permit or certificate is required. For other uses for which a
Special Use Permit is required, application shall be made for such
permit prior to commencing the particular special use of the land.
32.13
1
The application shall be transmitted forthwith to the Board of
Adjustment. After a public hearing, the Board of Adjustment may
grant or deny the Special Use Permit requested. The Special Use
Permit, if granted, shall include such approved plans as may be
required. In granting the permit, the Board of Adjustment shall
find: (Amendment adopted June 3, 2003)
(1) that the use will not materially endanger the public health
or safety if located where proposed and developed according
to the plan as submitted and approved;
(2) that the use meets all required conditions and
specifications;
(3) that the use will not substantially injure the value of
adjoining or abutting property or that the use is a public
necessity; and,
(4) that the location and character of the use, if developed
according to the plan as submitted and approved, will be in
harmony with the area in which it is to be located and in
general conformity with the plan of development of
Burlington and its environs.
b. In granting the permit, the Board of Adjustment may designate
such conditions in addition and in connection therewith, as will,
in its opinion, assure that the use in its proposed location will be
harmonious with the area in which it is proposed to be located
and with the spirit of this ordinance. All such additional
conditions shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting at which
the permit is granted and also on the certificate of the special
permit or on the plans submitted therewith. All conditions shall
run with the land and shall be binding on the original applicants
for the Special Use Permit, their heirs, successors and assigns.
(Amendment adopted June 3, 2003)
c. If the Board of Adjustment denies the Special Use Permit, the
reasons therefore shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting
at which the permit is denied.
d. In addition to the specific conditions imposed by the regulations
of the use district in which they are permitted.
32.13
2
e. In the event of failure to comply with the plans approved by the
Board of Adjustment or with any conditions imposed upon the
Special Use Permit, the permit shall thereupon immediately
become void and of no effect. No building permits for further
construction or Certificates of Occupancy under said Special Use
Permit shall be issued, and all completed structures shall be
regarded as non-conforming uses subject to the provisions of
Section 32.14 of this chapter; provided, however, that the City
Council shall not be prevented from thereafter rezoning said
property for its most appropriate use.
f. Where plans are required to be submitted and approved as part of
the application for a Special Use Permit, minor modifications of
the original plans may be made by the Board of Adjustment. Any
substantial change shall be authorized only after a public hearing.
(Amendment adopted June 3, 2003)
g. Expiration of Permits: A Special Use Permit issued by the Board
of Adjustment shall be null and void 24 months after the date of
its issuance unless construction is begun during said 24-month
period.
2. Deleted by amendment adopted June 3, 2003.
3. Required Plans and Drawings: Applicants for Special Use Permits are
advised to confer with the Planning Director prior to submitting a formal
request for a permit in order to allow City agencies to be canvassed for
the purpose of ascertaining what information will be required to
accompany the permit request. Maps, plans and drawings must be
submitted in sufficient detail and at a large enough scale to indicate the
extent, location and character of the proposed activity. In addition, the
location of the activity in relation to nearby buildings and properties
must be clearly indicated. (Amendment adopted June 3, 2003)
Depending on the scope and size of the proposed activity, the following
information may be required:
a. Vicinity map showing the location of the property in question with
respect to existing and proposed streets, rivers, streams, railroad
tracks and other major physical features.

g. Proposed provision for utilities.
h. Location, size, height and orientation of all signs.

following, where applicable: (Amendment adopted June 3, 2003)

continue under the regulations that were applicable to the use prior to
June 3, 2003. Any special requirements that were part of the issuance
of a Special Use Permit will continue to apply to the property. However,
when an amendment to a Special Use Permit is requested that is no
longer allowed by Special Use Permit in the underlying zoning district,
the petitioner may attempt to rezone the property to a general zoning
district or Conditional zoning district that allows the use. (Amendment
adopted June 3, 2003)

AND USES OF LAND AND BUILDINGS
A. Intent: Within the districts established by this ordinance or amendments that may
later be adopted, there exist lots, structures and uses of land and/or structures that
were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended but that would be
prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future
amendment. It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these non-conformities to
continue but not to encourage their continuance, except as provided in Paragraph E.
It is further the intent of this ordinance that non-conformities shall not be enlarged
upon, expanded or extended nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or
uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. (Amended August 19, 1975)
B. Completion of Buildings: To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this ordinance shall be
deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any
building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this ordinance and upon which actual construction has
been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the
placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent
manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has

carried on diligently.
C. Non-Conforming Lots of Record: In any residential district, a single-family dwelling
and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the

separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same
ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district,
provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area
and/or width shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is
located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the
Board of Adjustment. A lot of record reduced in area and/or width by governmental
action in the acquisition of public rights-of-way shall continue to be deemed a lot of
record as provided herein.
The division of any parcel, lot or tract that creates a lot with a width or area below the
requirements stated in this ordinance shall be prohibited, except by governmental
action in the acquisition of public rights-of-way.
32.14
1
D. Non-Conforming Buildings: Where a lawful building exists at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of

following requirements are met: (Amended August 19, 1975)

increased, not extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.

32.15

It is further provided that an individual shall be eligible to serve on only one City board
or commission at any one time. It is therefore expressly provided that concurrent
membership on City boards and commissions shall not be permitted.
D. Vacancies: Vacancies occurring for reasons other than expired terms shall be filled as
they occur for the unexpired remainder of the term either by the City Council of the City
of Burlington or the County Commissioners of Alamance County, depending upon the

I. Appeals From Decisions of the Zoning Administrator: An appeal from the decisions of
the Zoning Administrator may be taken to the Board of Adjustment by any person who
has standing under G.S. 160A-393(d) or the City may appeal a decision to the board of
adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk. The
notice of appeal shall state the grounds for appeal.
J. Appeal Stays All Proceedings: An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement
order stays enforcement of the action appealed from unless the Zoning Administrator
certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal has been filed that because of the facts
stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or because
the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with the
enforcement of the ordinance. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be
stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement
32.15
3
proceedings are not stayed, the applicant the appellant may file with the Zoning
Administrator a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal and the Board of
Adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed.
K. Powers of the Board of Adjustment: The board shall have the following powers:
1. To Hear Appeals: To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is error
in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning
Administrator.
2. Voting: The concurring vote of four-fifths of the board shall be necessary to grant a
variance. A majority of the members shall be required to decide any other quasijudicial
matter or to determine an appeal made in the nature of certiorari. For taking
action on any matter pertaining to non-quasi-judicial maters, there shall be present a
quorum of three members from the entire board.
3. To Authorize Variances: The Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of
the ordinance upon a showing of all of the following:
a) Unnecessary hardship would result from carrying out the strict application of the
ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the
variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
b) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as
location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as
well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood
or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.
c) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property
owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist
that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created
hardship.
d) The requested variance is consistent with the sprit, purpose and intent of the
ordinance such that public safety is secured and substantial justice is achieved.
In considering all proposed variances to this ordinance, the board shall, before
making any finding in a specific case, first determine that the proposed variance will
not allow the establishment of a use not otherwise permitted in a district by this
ordinance; extend in area or expand a non-conforming use of land; change the district
boundaries shown on the Zoning Map; impair any adequate supply of light and air to
adjacent property; materially increase the public danger of fire; materially diminish or
impair established property values within the surrounding area; or in any other
respect impair the public health, safety, morals and general welfare.
In granting a variance, the board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the
location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it
may deem advisable provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the
variance.
32.15
4
A special exception to the building setback, front yard, side yard, rear yard, plot
coverage and height requirements may be approved by the Board of Adjustment for
historic districts and for designated historic properties if the application complies with
the intent of the Architectural and Historic Guidelines  Burlington Historic District
and if first recommended by the Historic Resources Commission provided that the
approved application will not constitute a threat to public safety.
4. To Issue Special Use Permits for Certain Uses: The board may issue a Special Use
Permit for certain uses in certain districts, as indicated in Sections 32.9 and 32.13 of
this chapter. The procedure for processing applications for such permits is given in
32.13:B.1. The considerations by which the board must be guided are given in
32.13:B.4.
L. Rehearings: The board shall refuse to hear an appeal or application previously denied
if it finds there have been no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances
bearing on the appeal or application.
M. Review by Certiorari: Every quasi-judicial decision shall be subject to review by the
superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari pursuant to G.S. 160A-393. A

Application: Written application for approval of a preliminary plan shall be made on proper forms to be furnished by the Planning Department or Planning Department Website and shall include all information as specified by the Plan Submission Standards for preliminary plans for the City of Burlington Technical Review Committee. Twelve copies of the preliminary plan shall be filed with the Planning Department at the time of application. Such application should be made subject to the City of Burlington Technical Review Committee plan submission schedule as provided in the Planning Department or Website. On average there are two opportunities each month to meet submission deadlines for Technical Review. For those subdivisions located within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City in which street rights-of-way are to be dedicated, a copy of the preliminary plan and all engineering data shall be forwarded to the North Carolina Department of Transportation for its review and approval.
2. Review by the Technical Review Committee
a. Preliminary approval of a subdivision plan shall not constitute approval of the final plat.
b. Preliminary approval of a subdivision plan shall apply for four years. Where a subdivision is being developed in sections, the four years shall be counted from the date of the most recent final approval granted to a portion of the subdivision. The preliminary approval of a subdivision plan shall terminate after four years unless the development has been initiated.
3. Improvements, Markers, Monuments Prohibited Prior to Approval: No improvements shall be made nor shall any permanent markers or monuments be installed in any subdivision prior to the granting of approval of a preliminary subdivision plan.
4. Fee: At the time of application for a preliminary approval of the subdivision plan, the subdivider shall pay a fee as established from time to time by the City Council. (Amendment adopted June 2, 1987)
(c) Procedure for Approval of Final Plats
1. Application: Written application for approval of the final plat shall be made in the office of the Planning Department by the subdivider on forms to be provided by the department. The application shall be accompanied by all required exhibits and shall contain authorization for the Planning
7
Department to record the final plat and protective covenants (if any) after approval of the final plat and shall include all information required in Section 33-7 and elsewhere in this chapter. At the time of application for approval of a final plat, the subdivider shall pay a fee as established from time to time by the City Council.
2. Copies, Fee, Required Information: Three original mylar copies of the final plat shall be filed with the Planning Department at the time of application. The applicant should submit a digital copy of the plat prior to the submittal of the original mylars in order to ensure the subdivision meets the requirements of this ordinance. At the time of filing a final plat, a subdivider shall pay a fee equal to the cost of recording the final plat and all required accompanying documents. The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plan as approved. A final plat may constitute any portion of the approved preliminary plan containing ten or more lots provided that the portion submitted conforms to all requirements of this chapter and provided further that any portion submitted for final approval shall include the lots on both sides of any streets shown on the final plat. This requirement for ten or more lots will be waived if the subdivider receives prior approval from the Planning Director or Designee.
3. Recommendations, Bases for Disapproval: Following a review of the final plat and all other material submitted in compliance with this chapter, the Planning Department in conjunction with other departments shall submit to the applicant a list of requested revisions to bring the subdivision plat into compliance or issue a statement of disapproval of the subdivision plat. A final plat may be disapproved for failure to comply with any or all requirements of this chapter, for failure to conform substantially to the preliminary plan as approved, for failure to fulfill contingencies placed upon the preliminary approval of the preliminary plan or for other reasons permitted under this chapter and other laws.
4. Conditions for Approval: (Amendment adopted April 21, 1987)
a. Residential Subdivisions. The Planning Director or Designee shall not approve any final plat of a residential subdivision until both of the following two conditions have been met:
1. All necessary easements and/or rights-of-way have been obtained for providing off-site sewer outfalls, streets, water mains or other facility connections between existing services and those services within the proposed subdivision. It is the responsibility of the subdivider to make arrangements for obtaining these necessary easements and/or rights-of-way. If the subdivider, after due diligence and reasonable effort, is unable to obtain the necessary easements, the City Council, in its discretion and upon application by the subdivider to the City Council, may assist the subdivider, using its power of eminent domain in obtaining such easements and/or rights-of-way; and, (Amendment adopted November 18, 2003)
8
2. The subdivider has either:
(i) Installed all required water mains, sanitary sewer lines and storm drainage facilities, completed construction of all necessary street improvements including grading, paving, curb and gutter, sidewalks and grass plots and received certified inspection approval of the above improvements by the City Engineer, or,
(ii) Installed all required storm drainage facilities, water mains and sanitary sewer lines, completed rough grading of all streets to approved engineering standards and received certified inspection approval of these improvements by the City Engineer; and the subdivider has completed (and received inspection approval for) or arranged assurances for completion of all of the remaining improvements (grading, paving, curb and gutter and sidewalks and grass plots as needed) by either providing a letter of credit guaranteed by a state or federal chartered bank/savings and loan, cashiers check, cash or performance bond to the City in an amount equal to 125% of the estimated cost of the remaining improvements; or by petitioning the City for installation and/or construction of the remaining improvements in accordance with the assessment provisions as established by the Charter of the City, Chapter VI, City Services and Facilities, Sub-Chapter C, Assessments for Local Improvements. The subdivider must provide financial compensation to the City before construction begins in an amount equal to that portion of the cost of the improvements apportioned to the subdivider. (Amendment adopted February 7, 2006)
(iii) For projects of 200 acres or more, a developer may request that a proposed subdivision of property be reviewed under the provisions of special "large tract" subdivision regulations that permit approval under the following circumstances: (Amendment adopted November 18, 2003)
A. A Primary Infrastructure Phase of improvements is proposed that will provide for the necessary public infrastructure to serve and create large parcels that abut a public street right-of-way and are five acres or greater in size, and if desired, provide for the purchase of such parcels by other developers.
B. The construction of the necessary infrastructure improvements to serve the Primary Infrastructure Phase of the project may be initiated in a manner that will meet the requirements of a typical subdivision project.
9
C. However, if desired by the developer, surety in the amount of 150% of the estimated total public infrastructure cost can be submitted to the City for approval prior to the inception of construction to guarantee completion of water, sewer, storm drainage and roadway infrastructure within the Primary Infrastructure Phase of development. This surety obligation may be met by providing a letter of credit guaranteed by a state or federal chartered bank/savings and loan, cash, a cashier's check, certified check or performance bond in the appropriate amount and by a company authorized to do business in North Carolina. (Amendment adopted February 7, 2006)
This decision to provide surety can also be made at any time after the initiation of construction activities provided that surety is submitted and approved for the balance of the remaining work in the Primary Infrastructure Phase.
D. Thereafter, a subdivision plat may then be approved and recorded for the Primary Infrastructure Phase thereby creating large parcels each of which can then be developed as a separate tract or further subdivided thereafter in conformance with the City's traditional subdivision regulations. No surety in lieu of construction can be provided for any portion of the public infrastructure improvements within any of these large parcels until all of the public infrastructure improvements for the submitted Primary Infrastructure Phase have been completed and accepted by the City.
b. Commercial and/or Industrial Subdivisions. The Planning Director or Designee shall not approve any final plat of a commercial and/or industrial subdivision until both of the following two conditions have been met:
1. All necessary easements and/or rights-of-way have been obtained for providing off-site sewer outfalls, streets, water mains or other facility connections between existing services and those services within the proposed subdivision. It is the responsibility of the subdivider to make arrangements for obtaining these necessary easements and/or rights-of-way. If the subdivider, after due diligence and reasonable effort, is unable to obtain the necessary easements, the City Council, in its discretion and upon application by the subdivider to the City Council, may assist the

(ii) Provided assurances for the completion of all proposed improvements, including but not limited to the items specified in (i) directly above by submitting to the City a letter of credit guaranteed by a state or federal chartered bank/savings and loan, certified check, cashiers check, performance bond or cash in an amount determined by the City Engineer to be equal to 125% of the estimated cost of all of the remaining improvements. (Amendment adopted February 7, 2006)
(iii) For projects of 200 acres or more, a developer may request that a proposed subdivision of property be reviewed under the provisions of special "large tract" subdivision regulations that permit approval under the following circumstances: (Amendment adopted November 18, 2003)
A. A Primary Infrastructure Phase of improvements is proposed that will provide for the necessary public infrastructure to serve and create large parcels that abut a public street right-of-way and are five acres or greater in size, and if desired, provide for the purchase of such parcels by other developers.
B. The construction of the necessary infrastructure improvements to serve the Primary Infrastructure Phase of the project may be initiated in a manner that will meet the requirements of a typical subdivision project.
C. However, if desired by the developer, surety in the amount of 150% of the estimated total public infrastructure cost can be submitted to the City for approval prior to the inception of construction to guarantee completion of water, sewer, storm drainage and roadway infrastructure within the Primary Infrastructure Phase of development. This surety obligation may be met by providing a letter of credit guaranteed by a state or federal chartered bank/savings and loan, cash, a cashier's check, certified check or performance bond in the appropriate amount and by a company authorized to
11
do business in North Carolina. (Amendment adopted February 7, 2006)
This decision to provide surety can also be made at any time after the initiation of construction activities provided that surety is submitted and approved for the balance of the remaining work in the Primary Infrastructure Phase.
D. Thereafter, a subdivision plat may then be approved and recorded for the Primary Infrastructure Phase thereby creating large parcels each of which can then be developed as a separate tract or further subdivided thereafter in conformance with the City's traditional subdivision regulations. No surety in lieu of construction can be provided for any portion of the public infrastructure improvements within any of these large parcels until all of the public infrastructure improvements for the submitted Primary Infrastructure Phase have been completed and accepted by the City.
c. Subdivisions which include provisions for the creation of lots for both residential and non-residential uses within the same development shall comply with the requirements for residential subdivisions set forth in a. above.
d. In commercial and industrial subdivisions where final plats are approved based on deposits being made for completion of improvements, Certificates of Occupancy shall not be issued for a building until all water and sewer improvements are complete and the building is connected to same.
5. Decision To Be In Writing: If the Planning Director or Designee denies approval of a subdivision plat, the applicant will be notified in writing stating what criteria needs to be met in order to obtain approval or provide reason for denial.

SECTION 33.8: DESIGN STANDARDS
(a) Location: No subdivision or platting of land for residential use shall be permitted in areas subject to flooding by normal rainfall, river or stream flooding, swamps or other factors unless suitable provision is made for satisfactory drainage. The drainage system shall be designed to ensure that 2 1/2 inches of water will be drained from any given area within 24 hours, assuming a 100% runoff. Further, no lot, however provided with satisfactory drainage, may be created so as to permit or encourage construction of buildings contrary to the provisions of a resolution of the City Council of Burlington adopted March 4, 1975, authorizing compliance by the City of Burlington with the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. All subdivision proposals shall be reviewed to assure that all such proposals: (1) minimize flood damage; (2) assure that public utilities and facilities are constructed so as to minimize flood damage; and, (3) so that adequate drainage is provided, all in accordance with the Floodplain Ordinance of the City of Burlington. Base flood elevation data shall be provided for all subdivisions having 50 or more lots or including five or more acres. (Amendment adopted November 19, 1989; effective April 1, 1981)

4. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed expressway or major thoroughfare, the Technical Review Committee may require frontage streets, reverse frontage with screen planting, deep lots or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
5. Reserve strips or parcels controlling access to streets shall be prohibited.
6. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be prohibited.
7. When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point by more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve having a radius of not less than 100 feet for minor thoroughfares and of such greater radii as the Technical Review Committee may require.
8. Streets shall be laid out so as to avoid acute angles between streets at their intersection except where consideration of traffic flow and geometric design requires merging streets.
18
9. Property lines at street intersections shall be shown as a chord connecting points not less than 15 feet back from the street intersection along each street right-of-way line. Longer setbacks for chord connections for property lines may be required by the Technical Review Committee when such design is advisable.

11. Alleys shall be permitted only in multifamily, commercial and industrial areas where required to provide for service access such as off-street parking, loading and unloading consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. Such alleys shall be at least 22 feet in width and shall permit safe and through vehicular movement.
l2. No permanently designed dead-end street (cul-de-sac) shall be longer than 800 feet except where land cannot otherwise be subdivided practicably. All permanent dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs) shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around having a street property line diameter of not less than 100 feet and a street pavement diameter of not less than 75 feet from back of curb to back of curb. Dead-end streets intended to be continued at a later time shall be provided with the same turn-around as required for a permanent dead-end street, but only that portion to be required as right-of-way when the street is continued shall be dedicated and made a public street.
13. No street names shall be used for either public or private streets that will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets. Street names proposed by the subdivider shall be subject to check by the Planning Department, and when duplication or confusion occurs, the Planning Department shall require the subdivider to substitute names free from duplication and confusion. The Planning Department shall maintain an up-to-date file of all street names in use in the City and county for the guidance of subdividers. (Amendment adopted December 16, 1986)
14. A tangent of at least 150 feet shall be introduced between reverse curves on major thoroughfares. On minor thoroughfares, such tangent length shall be not less than 100 feet. For local access streets, such tangent length shall be not less than 60 feet.

thoroughfares and not greater than 12 percent for local access streets. No grade shall be less than five-tenths of one percent in the gutter profile. Variation from these grades may be permitted by the City Engineer but only to allow adjustment of severe topography.
17. All changes in grade of expressways, major thoroughfares and minor thoroughfares shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent in feet to 32 times the algebraic difference in the percents of grade. All changes in grade of other streets shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length of 40 times the algebraic difference in the percents of grade.
18. Minimum street right-of-way widths shall be as follows:
Type of Street Minimum Right-of-Way

New property lines shall meet current minimum setback requirements or an easement for the sewer facilities must be shown on the plat.
7. Lots being reduced in size by partial combination with adjoining property shall be evaluated by the criteria in Section 6, Paragraphs a. or b., as appropriate. (Amendment adopted June 21, 1994)
8. Lots in watershed areas that must have an individual (on site) water supply and sewage disposal system shall be evaluated by current state and Alamance County Health Department regulations and/or other agencies governing the protection of public water supplies. (Amendment adopted June 21, 1994)
9. Corner lot dimensions shall be large enough to allow for erection of buildings without encroaching upon the minimum required setbacks from both streets
24
or the established vehicle sight area easement at the intersection. This sight easement shall be that triangle formed by the intersecting right-of-way lines adjacent to each corner lot and a line across the corner of the lot between points 35 feet from the street intersection along each street right-of-way.
Within this easement, no building, no earth bank, no vegetation and no other obstruction shall be allowed that is more than three feet in height above the finished centerline grade of the road. In lieu of providing a sight area easement, the owner may dedicate said area as part of the street right-of-way. An example of such design is shown below:
10. Lots that have double frontage (through lots) shall be prohibited except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. An easement of at least ten feet in width across which there shall be no right of access to the abutting street shall be required along the rear street property lines of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other disadvantageous use. No right of access across such required easements shall be granted except by the Planning Director or Designee upon review by the Technical Review Committee.
11. All lots shall be provided, by means of streets that have been constructed in conformance with the standards and specifications of the City Engineering Department and/or the North Carolina Department of Transportation and dedicated in accordance with this chapter, with access to an existing street that has been accepted for maintenance by the State of North Carolina or the City of Burlington. Where private streets have provision for continual maintenance and are constructed to City or State standards (depending upon
25
jurisdiction) within a minimum 60-foot right-of-way and are controlled by a responsible association, club, fellowship or corporation, requirements as to dedication may be waived by the Planning Director or Designee upon review by the Technical Review Committee.
12. All quadrangular lots, and insofar as practical, all other lots, shall have side lines that are at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines.
13. Lots for other than residential use shall include sufficient space for off-street parking, loading and unloading and circulation of traffic.
(f) Public Site and Open Spaces: Where a proposed park, playground, open space or school is designated in the Burlington Comprehensive Plan and is located in whole or in part within a subdivision, the Planning Director or Designee upon review by the Technical Review Committee may require the dedication or reservation of such area within the subdivision as a condition to any approval in cases in which such requirements are in the public interest. Such requirement for dedication shall be in accordance with introductory paragraphs in Section 33-7 above and Section 33-10 below.
(g) Utilities: All electric, telephone and other utilities shall be placed underground in all subdivisions created after the date of adoption of this chapter. Such installations shall be made in accordance with required standards and accepted practices of the utility provider.
(h) Subdivision Name: Every subdivision shall be given a name that shall not duplicate or closely approximate that of any other subdivision existing or previously planned.
SECTION 33.9: REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
All improvements under this chapter shall be completed prior to submission and request for approval of the final plat except as provided in Section 33-6, Paragraph 3. above.
(a) Markers.
1. Markers shall be placed at lot corners as specified below:
a. A reinforced concrete marker shall be set on the right-of-way line on at least one lot corner (on each side of the street) near the ends of each block. In addition, points of curvature and points of tangencies will be referenced with concrete markers at the nearest corner lots on the right-of-way lines (on each side of the street). The distance from the point of curvature and the point of tangency to these lot corner markers will be shown on the final plat. Concrete markers shall be a minimum of three feet long and have a minimum cross sectional area of nine square inches. They shall protrude above the ground not more than six inches.
b. All interior lot corners or other points not requiring concrete markers as in this section shall be marked with an iron pipe or pin having a minimum diameter of three-fourths of an inch. Such iron pins shall
26
be a minimum of three feet in length and shall extend above the ground approximately ten inches.
2. Markers shall be installed prior to the submission of the final plat, and no final plat shall be approved until it has been determined by the Planning Director or Designee that all required markers have been installed.
3. The location and type of all markers used shall be indicated on the final plat.
(b) Utility, Drainage and Street Improvements
1. Utility, drainage and street improvements shall be as required by this chapter and the Technical Review Committee.
2. No road improvements shall commence until the Planning Director or Designee has received the written approval of the Technical Review Committee and where the Technical Review Committee has given approval to the preliminary plan, and all improvements thereafter shall conform substantially to the preliminary plan.
3. All streets shall be improved to the full width and to the cross section and profile under such specifications as are above prescribed including street paving, curbs and gutter, sidewalks and other improvements and shall be to the width, cross section and profile as required above.
4. The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with a governmental water supply where governmental water supply is available within 1,000 feet of the property.
5. The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with a governmental sanitary sewerage system where a governmental sanitary sewerage system is available within 1,000 feet of the property.
6. Water mains and sanitary sewers shall be of such materials and shall be located and installed under such specifications as prescribed by the City.
7. Approved City street name signs shall be installed on the northwest and southeast corners of every intersection.
8. All drainage facilities shall be constructed as required at the time of preliminary plan approval.
9. Storm sewers, drains and structures installed by the subdivider shall be installed of a size and type and in locations as shall be approved by the Planning Commission upon recommendation of the City Engineer.
10. The City shall not be responsible for any internal subdivision drainage connections to publicly maintained drainage facilities, streams or other outlets having constant flow.
This does not imply that the subdivider will be responsible for the maintenance of these facilities after they have been dedicated to the City.

SECTION 33-10: MISCELLANEOUS
(a) Planned Unit Development: Any tract of land of ten acres or more (depending upon the zoning district in which it is located) may be designed and developed as a Planned Unit Development as permitted in Section 32.13, Paragraph G, of the Zoning Ordinance of Burlington, North Carolina. Such developments shall meet all design requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and, where not specified in the Zoning Ordinance, shall meet design requirements of this chapter. In all cases, all procedural requirements and design standards of this chapter shall be met.
(b) Density Bonus Developments: All subdivisions of land involving a recreation and/or open space site as specified in the Comprehensive Plan for Burlington shall require reservation of such sites in an amount in acreage as required in the Comprehensive Plan, such reservation to be in accord with Section 33-7(c)2.d. above. As an alternate procedure, the subdivider may dedicate recreation and/or open space sites at no cost to the City and may receive the following design density bonus concessions:
1. Mandatory Reservations
a. The subdivider may include the amount of dedicated land in the calculation to determine the maximum number of lots to be permitted on the land remaining after deletion of the dedicated land and the subtraction of the area included in street rights-of-way, provided, however, that the resultant overall increase in density shall not exceed 30 percent of that normally permitted in the zoning district in which the subdivision is to be located, that individual lots may not be reduced more than 30 percent in area required nor more than 10 feet in width required in the zoning district in which the subdivision is located, and that in no case shall lots be reduced below the area and frontage required in the R-6 zoning district.
b. The subdivision may be designed with local access streets having rights-of-way of 60 feet developed in accordance with the provisions of Section 33-8 of this chapter.
c. If the subdivider does not desire to apply the foregoing density bonus provisions to a subdivision in which he dedicates a park or open space site at no cost to the City, he may transfer the percentage density bonus to any other subdivision, provided, however, that in no case shall the increased overall density exceed that allowed in the residential zoning district next lower than that in which the subdivision is located. In calculating density for the subdivision to which the density bonus is transferred, any dedicated sites plus street rights-of-way may be included to establish the maximum allowable number of lots, subject, however, to the maximum increase in density of 30 percent of that normally permitted in the zoning district in which the subdivision is located and subject to the maximum reduction of 30 percent in lot area and 10 feet in lot width.
d. A subdivider may transfer density bonus benefits and rights to more than one subdivision until benefits and rights accrued in a previous subdivision are equaled but not exceeded, subject to Subsection g. below.
28
e. The location of all sites to be dedicated for recreation and/or open space purposes shall be approved by the Planning and Recreation Commissions and/or the City Council.
f. No recreation and/or open space site to be dedicated shall be less than one acre.
g. Density transfer rights permitted herein shall be void after a lapse of two years from the date of the last final approval of a portion of a subdivision in which density bonus provisions were accrued.
2. Optional Dedications
a. Any subdivision not involving a recreation and/or open space site, as required in the Comprehensive Plan, may provide at the option of the subdivider for the dedication of recreation and/or open space land at no cost to the City and may develop the subdivision under the provisions of Subparagraph a. immediately above, observing the same requirements and restrictions and accruing the same benefits and rights provided, however, that in the case of such optional dedication, a recordable plat dedicating the recreation and/or open space shall be presented to the Technical Review Committee along with the preliminary plan.
(c) Hardships and Variances
1. Where extraordinary hardships may result from strict interpretation of this chapter, the Planning Director or Designee upon review by the Technical Review Committee may vary this chapter so that substantial justice is realized and the public interest is protected provided that such variance does not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the Comprehensive Plan for Burlington and its jurisdiction or the objectives of this chapter.
2. The subdivider shall submit a petition stating clearly and definitely the reason for a request of variance. Consideration will be given based on the following factors only:
a. Special conditions affecting the physical property.
b. Undue developmental hardships that will result from ordinary adherence to the requirements.
c. A determination that the granting of a variance shall not be detrimental to adjacent property or to the public interest.
3. When subdivision plans have been submitted to the Planning Department and have been duly approved and are then submitted to agencies of the federal government and such agencies require changes in the subdivision plan as mandatory prior to their approval for mortgage guarantees, such mandatory changes shall be accepted by the Planning Director or Designee as prima facie evidence of a hardship, and the changes will be accepted under the
29
provisions of the section unless such changes would be a clear violation of the intent of this chapter and the Burlington Comprehensive Plan.
(d) Penalty
1. Any violation of this chapter or amendments thereof shall be a misdemeanor under the laws of the State of North Carolina, and the offender, upon conviction, shall be punished as for a misdemeanor. Each day that any violation of this chapter exists shall constitute a separate offense. Any person, firm or corporation violating the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished as provided by North Carolina General Statutes, Section 14-4, and shall be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days and shall be further subject to the provisions of G.S. 160A-175. (Amendment adopted October 1, 1991)
2. Any person who, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land located within the jurisdiction of the City of Burlington, hereafter subdivides land in violation of this chapter or transfers or sells land by reference to, exhibition of, or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land before the plat has been properly approved under such ordinance and recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds for Alamance County shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring land shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty. The City, through its attorney or other official designated by the Council, may enjoin illegal subdivision, transfer or sale of land by action for injunction.
(e) Amendment
1. Amendments to this chapter may be proposed by the Planning Department, the Planning Commission and/or the City Council and shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for approval before being enacted. Other persons or entities may submit proposed amendments to the Planning Commission for consideration and recommendation to City Council.
2. The City Council of Burlington, North Carolina, may adopt amendments to this chapter, providing that a public hearing thereon shall first be held, public notice of which hearing shall be given at least ten days prior to such hearing.
3. No amendment failing of passage at its first public hearing by the City Council shall be resubmitted for a period of one year, except upon approval by City Council for urgent reasons of public interest.
(f) Repeal
Chapter 33, SUBDIVISIONS, of the Burlington City Code as existing on the date of this chapter, is hereby repealed.
(g) Separability
Any clause or provision of this chapter declared invalid by any court having jurisdiction shall not affect the validity of this chapter as a whole or any other part thereof.
30
