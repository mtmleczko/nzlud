EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility allowing for
an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially are
odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation.
Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty
provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised Code.
Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated
by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs
between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

THE CHARTER
OF THE

PREAMBLE
   We, the people of the City of Wickliffe, in the County of Lake, State of

power and authority to change its boundaries in the manner authorized by the
laws of the State of Ohio, except that no territory shall be detached from or
annexed to the City, nor shall the City be annexed to or merged with any other
body politic, nor shall the corporate existence of the City be terminated,
without the assent of a majority of the electors of the City voting on such
proposal, or the assent of the Council given in such manner as to be subject to
review by a vote of the electors of the City.
ARTICLE II
POWERS
   The City of Wickliffe shall have all the powers, general or special,

State of Ohio.
ARTICLE III
THE COUNCIL
   SECTION III-1. COMPOSITION, TERM AND QUALIFICATIONS.
   The legislative powers of the Municipality except as otherwise provided by

   The Councilperson elected as President of Council shall preside at all
meetings of Council and shall also have all the powers and duties of a

prior to his/her election or appointment.
   No person shall serve as a member of Council unless during his/her term of

(Approved by voters November 2, 1954.)
   SECTION III-3. REMOVAL.
   The Council shall be the judge of the election and qualifications of its own
members. It may expel or remove any member for gross misconduct, or
misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance in or disqualification for office, or
for the conviction while in office of a crime involving moral turpitude, or for
a violation of his/her oath of office, or persistent failure to abide by the
rules of the Council, or the absence without justifiable excuse from three (3)
consecutive regular meetings of the Council; provided, however, that such
expulsion shall not take place without the concurrence of two-thirds (2/3) of
the members elected to Council nor until the accused member shall have been
notified in writing of the charge against him/her at least ten (10) days in
advance of a public hearing upon such charge, and he/she or his/her counsel has
been given an opportunity to be heard, present evidence or examine any witness
appearing in support of such charge.
   SECTION III-4. VACANCIES.
   (a)    Whenever the office of Ward Councilperson shall become vacant, the
vacancy shall be filled by electing a successor to the office for the unexpired
term. A successor shall be elected to the office for the unexpired term at a
special election called by the Mayor to be held within one hundred ten (110)
days after the said vacancy has occurred. In the event that a vacancy occurs
and the balance of the unexpired term is one hundred eighty (180) days or less,
the vacancy shall be filled by appointment by a majority vote of all of the
remaining members of Council; and if the vacancy shall not be filled within
thirty (30) days, the Mayor shall fill such vacancy by appointment.
   Said  special election shall be governed in all respects by the provisions
contained in
Article X of this Charter controlling regular municipal elections, except that:
      (1)    The date of the special election shall be set forth in the call by
the Mayor.
      (2)    The special primary election shall be on the seventh (7th) Tuesday
prior to said election.
      (3)    The Petition papers of any candidate shall be filed at or before
4:00 p.m., of the thirtieth (30th) day next preceding the special primary
election day.
      (4)    Within one (1) day after the filing of such petition the election
authorities shall notify the candidate in writing, mailed to the address stated
in the petition, if such petition is sufficient, and if so, the name of such
candidate shall be placed upon the proper ballot as required by law and this
Charter. If the election authorities find that a petition is insufficient or
incorrect in form or substance the same shall be returned by registered mail to
the candidate with an explanation of the reason for its return. In such case,
the candidate shall have an additional five (5) days from the date of such
mailing in which to file additional signatures or to correct the errors in the
original petition, if possible, and to refile the petition with the election
authorities, not later than 4:00 p.m., on said fifth (5th) day. Upon such
refiling if the petition is found by the election authorities to be sufficient
in form, and substance, the candidate shall be so notified and his/her name
placed upon the proper ballot as required by law and this Charter. If the
petition as refiled is not sufficient or correct, it shall be rejected, and the
candidate so notified by mail.
   However, in the event there are only two or less candidates seeking to fill
the vacancy, then in that event the special general election shall be held on
the date designated for the special primary election and the candidate
receiving the highest number of votes at the special election shall be declared
to be elected and fill said vacancy for the unexpired term. In the event there
are three or more candidates seeking to fill the vacancy then the special
primary and special general election provided for in
Article X shall be held on the dates set forth in the Mayor's call.
   (b)    Vacancy in Office of Councilperson-at-large or Council President. 
Any vacancy in the office of Councilperson-at-large or Council President,
whether occurring by death or disqualification, removal or resignation or by
succession to the office of the Mayor, shall be filled by appointment by a

fund was created shall be transferred to the fund from which said bonds or
notes are to be paid. 
   (b)    No transfer shall be made of moneys raised or appropriated for the
payment of any bond or note of the City, until all indebtedness, interest and
other obligations which can lawfully be paid from such moneys have been paid.
   At the close of each fiscal year the unencumbered balance of each
appropriation, except appropriations to bond or note funds or any other trust
or special fund which the Council by law or by this Charter shall be authorized
to create, shall revert to the fund from which it was appropriated, and shall
be subject to future appropriation.
   SECTION VIII-4. PAYMENT OF CLAIMS.
   No money shall be drawn from the treasury, nor shall any obligation for the
expenditure of money be incurred, except pursuant to appropriations made by the
Council. No warrant for the payment of any claim shall be issued until such
claim shall have been approved in writing by the head of the department or by
the board or commission for which the obligation was incurred. Each head of a
department and his/her surety shall be liable to the City for all loss and
damage sustained by the City by reason of the negligent or corrupt approval of
any claim against the City in his/her department. The Director of Finance shall
have power to require evidence that the amount of the claim is justly due and
is in conformity to law and ordinance, and for that purpose he/she may summon
before him any officer, agent or employee of any department of this City, any
claimant or other person, and examine him upon oath or affirmation relative
thereto. The Council may by ordinance provide for additional regulations or
controls with respect to the payment of claims.
   SECTION VIII-5. CUSTODY AND DEPOSIT OF FUNDS.
   The Council shall by ordinance provide for the custody of all funds of the
City and for the deposit of funds in a bank or banks. All funds received on
behalf of the City by any officer, employee or agent thereof shall be promptly
paid over to the Director of Finance and by him/her promptly placed in a
depository bank, but the Council may authorize such sums as it deems proper to
be kept in cash for the daily operation of any department or office. The
Director of Finance, with the concurrence of a majority of the members of
Council present at a duly convened meeting, shall invest moneys of the City in
bonds or notes of this City, or any other investment permitted by law, in such
manner as is now or hereafter authorized by general law for such investment by
cities.
   SECTION VIII-6. CERTIFICATION OF EXPENDITURES.
   No contract, agreement or other obligation involving the expenditure of
moneys shall be entered into, nor shall any ordinance, resolution or order for
the expenditure of moneys be passed, adopted or issued by the Council, or be
authorized by any officer of the City, unless the Director of Finance shall
have first certified in writing to the Council, or to the proper officer, as
the case may be, that the money required for such contract, agreement,
obligation or expenditure is in the treasury to the credit of the fund from
which it is to be drawn and not appropriated for any other purpose. The
provisions of this section shall not be construed to prevent the making of
contracts for a period extending beyond a single fiscal year when such
contracts are otherwise authorized by this Charter or by general law. All
moneys actually in the treasury to the credit of the fund from which they are
to be drawn, and all moneys applicable to the payment of the obligation or
appropriation involved that are anticipated to come into the treasury before
the maturity of such contract, agreement or obligation, from taxes,
assessments, license fees, or from sales of service, products or by-products of
any municipal undertaking, and moneys to be derived from lawfully authorized
bonds or notes, shall, for the purpose of such certificate, be deemed to be in
the treasury to the credit of the appropriate fund, and shall be subject to
such certification.
   SECTION VIII-7. PURCHASES, CONTRACTS, PUBLIC BIDDING.
   The Council may authorize expenditures of the funds of the City as provided
by Section 735.05 of the Ohio Revised Code, as that section is amended from
time to time.  Expenditures by the City of Wickliffe in excess of fifty percent
(50%) of the current state limit as provided by Section 735.05 of the Ohio
Revised Code, must have the approval by Council by ordinance or resolution. 
Expenditures of funds of the city of more than the current limit as provided by
Section 735.05 of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be made by written contract with
the lowest and best bidder after public advertising and receipt of bids in the
manner provided by ordinance.  The Council may authorize expenditures of the
funds of the City in amounts exceeding the current state limit as provided by
Section 735.05 of the Ohio Revised Code, without public bidding for the
acquisition of real estate, for the discharge of noncontractural claim against
the City, for personal services, for the joint use of facilities or exercise of
powers with other political subdivisions, or for the product or services of
public utilities including those municipally operated.  (Amended 11-4-08; 11-5-
19.)
   SECTION VIII-8. PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   Public improvements of all kinds may be made by the appropriate department
either by the direct employment of the necessary labor and purchase of supplies
and materials, with a separate account as to each improvement so made, or by
contract let as provided in the next preceding section either for a closed
price or upon a unit basis.
ARTICLE IX
TAXATION
   SECTION IX-1. CHARTER TAX RATE LIMITATION.
   The Council may levy annually, without a vote of the people, a tax on
property assessed and listed for taxation according to value, for the purpose
of paying current operating expenses and other expenses payable from the
general fund of the City, at a rate not to exceed four and eighty-hundredths
(4.80) mills per dollar of assessed valuation.
(Approved by voters November 7, 2006)
   SECTIONIX-2. LEVIES WITHIN THE TEN-MILL LIMITATION.
   The Council shall levy annually, without a vote of the people, a tax on
property assessed and listed for taxation according to value at a rate
sufficient to provide amounts necessary to pay, to the extent not paid from
other sources, the debt charges on all general obligation bonds and bond
anticipation notes lawfully issued by the City and the expenses incident to the
management of the bond retirement fund, which levy shall be placed before and
in preference to all other levies.  The Council may also levy, without a vote
of the people, (i) the tax levy for police and fire pensions prescribed by
division (B) of Sections 742.33 and 742.34 of the Revised Code or any successor
provisions and (ii) a tax levy to provide funds to pay costs of permanent
improvements the City is authorized to acquire, construct or improve.  The
levies authorized and made pursuant to this Section shall be outside of
limitations provided in
Article IX, Section 1 of this Charter, but subject to the ten-mill limitation
imposed by law.
(Approved by voters November 7, 2006)
   SECTIONIX-3. INCOME TAX LEVIES.
   The Council may, without a vote of the people, levy taxes on property
assessed and listed for taxation according to value, for the purpose of paying
the current operating expenses and for the purpose of any other expense which
may lawfully be included within the general levy for the general fund of the
City and in addition to the purpose of police and fire pensions not to exceed
four and eighty-hundredths (4.80) mills per dollar of assessed valuation.
   If in any year authority is obtained to refund bonds within the ten (10)
mill limitation for the purpose of reducing the total tax rate for county,
school and municipal purposes, thereby releasing millage for current operating
purposes within the ten (10) mill limitation, the limitation of the Section or
Article may be exceeded in such year by the amount of such millage reduction.
   The Council shall annually levy a sufficient sum to pay the interest and
bond retirement fund charges on all bonds and notes of the City of Wickliffe
lawfully issued, and the expenses incident to the management of the bond
retirement fund, which entire levy shall be outside of limitations provided in
this Charter, but subject to limitations imposed by general law, and placed
before and in preference to all other levies.  Amounts certified under the laws
of the State as necessary for such purpose shall not be subject to change by
Council.
   The Council may at any time at least sixty (60) days prior to a November
election, declare by resolution, adopted by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all
members elected thereto, that the amount of taxes which may be raised within
the limitations of this Charter will be insufficient to provide an adequate
amount for the necessary requirements of the City for current operating
expenses, and other expenses payable from the general fund of the City, and
such permanent improvements and equipment as shall have an estimated useful
life of five (5) years or more, and that it is necessary to levy taxes in
excess of such limitations, in addition to the levies authorized and limited by
this Charter, for the municipal purpose or purposes specified in such
resolution.  Such resolution shall specify the additional sum, which it is
necessary to levy, the purpose or purposes thereof, the additional rate
estimated to be required therefore and the date of any proposed election
thereon.  Such resolution shall be effective upon its adoption and shall be
certified within five (5) days thereafter to the election authorities, who
shall place such question upon the ballot at the next succeeding November
election.  If a majority of those voting thereon vote for the approval of such
additional levy, the Council shall immediately make such levy, or such part
thereof as it finds necessary, pursuant to such approval and certify the same
to the County Auditor, to be placed on the tax list and collected as other
taxes.
   The authority of the Council to submit additional levies to a vote of the
people under authority of the Constitution or laws of this State shall not be
deemed impaired or abridged by reason of any provision contained in this
Charter.
   Provided, however, that the City shall not levy a tax on income at a rate in
excess of one- half percent (½%) without having obtained the approval of the
excess by a majority of the electors of the City of Wickliffe voting on the
question at a general, special or primary election.  The Council of the City of
Wickliffe shall file with the Board of Elections, at least sixty (60) days
before the day of the election a copy of the ordinance, together with a
resolution specifying the date such election is to be held, and directing the
Board of Elections to conduct the election.
   The Council may, by ordinance or ordinances passed from time to time,
allocate the annual proceeds of any tax on income levied by the City for use to
pay costs of general municipal functions of the City, including current
operating expenses, costs of permanent improvements and debt charges on
indebtedness and other obligations incurred to pay costs of permanent
improvements; provided, however, that the Council shall allocate not less than
twenty-five percent (25%) of the proceeds of any such tax in excess of a two-
percent (2%) income tax rate to pay costs of permanent improvements, including
debt charges on indebtedness and other obligations incurred to pay costs of
permanent improvements.  The proceeds of the tax allocated for use to pay costs
of permanent improvements shall be placed in a separate fund for that purpose.
(Approved by voters November 7, 2017; Ord. 2017-49.  Passed 7-17-17.)

   101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is

number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be guilty of a
minor misdemeanor punished by a fine not exceeding one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).  A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation continues or occurs.

      (2)    Whether the available agenda of any such future meeting states
that any specific type of public business, identified by such person, is to be
discussed at the meeting.
   (b)    Any notification provided herein to be given by the Clerk may be
given by any person acting in behalf of or under the authority of the Clerk.
   (c)    A reasonable attempt at notification shall constitute notification in
compliance with these rules.
   (d)    At the commencement of each meeting, the Clerk or a member of the
municipal body shall submit a certificate of the Clerk as to compliance with
these rules as to notice and notification. Such certificate shall be conclusive
upon the City and the municipal body involved as to the facts set forth
therein. Such certificate shall be conclusive evidence as to the facts set

complied with.
   (e)    The Clerk shall maintain a record of the date and manner, and time if
pertinent under these rules, of all actions taken with regard to notices and
notification under Sections
107.04,
107.05 and
107.06 hereof, and shall retain copies of proofs of publication of any
notification or notices published thereunder.
   (f)    To better ensure compliance with these rules as to notice and
notification, it shall be the responsibility of the chairman or secretary of a
municipal body other than Council, or the person or persons calling the
meetings, to timely advise the Clerk of future meetings, and the subject

(Ord. 1976-46. Passed 7-19-76.)
   107.08  PUBLIC MEETINGS OF MUNICIPAL BODIES.
   (a)    All meetings of any municipal body are declared to be public meetings
open to the public at all times.
   The minutes of a regular or special meeting of any such municipal body shall
be promptly recorded and open to public inspection. The minutes need only
reflect the general subject matter of discussions in executive sessions
authorized under subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)    The members of a municipal body may hold an executive session only
after a majority of a quorum of the municipal body determines, by a roll call
vote, to hold such a session and only at a regular or special meeting for the
sole purpose of consideration of any of the following matters:
      (1)    To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion or compensation of a public employee or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official,
licensee or regulated individual, unless the public employee, official,
licensee or regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as otherwise
provided by law, no municipal body shall hold an executive session for the
discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the performance of his
official duties or for his removal from office. If a municipal body holds an
executive session pursuant to subsection (b) hereof, the motion and vote to
hold that executive session shall state which one or more of the approved
purposes listed in subsection (b)(1) hereof are the purposes for which the
executive session is to be held, but need not include the name of any person to
be considered at the meeting.
      (2)    To consider the purchase of property for public purposes, or for
the sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of
information would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a
person whose personal, private interest is adverse to the general public
interest. No member of a municipal body shall use this subsection as a
subterfuge for providing covert information to prospective buyers or sellers. A
purchase or sale of public property is void if the seller or buyer of the
public property has received covert information from a member of the municipal
body that has not been disclosed to the general public in sufficient time for
other prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers.
            If the minutes of the municipal body show that all meetings and
deliberations of the municipal body have been conducted in compliance with this
section, any instruments executed by the municipal body purporting to convey,
lease or otherwise dispose of any right, title or interest in any public
property shall be conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance
with this section insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide
purchasers, lessees or transferees of the property is concerned.
      (3)    Conferences with an attorney for the municipal body concerning
disputes involving the municipal body that are the subject of pending or
imminent court action
      (4)    Preparing for, conducting, or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment.
      (5)    Matters required to be kept confidential by Federal law or rules
or state statutes.
      (6)    Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of
the matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the
purpose of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law.
   If a municipal body holds an executive session to consider any of the
matters listed in subsections (b)(2) to (6) hereof, the motion and vote to hold
that executive session shall state which one or more of the approved matters
listed in those subsections are to be considered at the executive session.
   (c)    All resolutions, rules or formal actions of any kind shall be adopted
in open meetings of municipal bodies.
(Ord. 1989-62. Passed 7-10-89.)
CHAPTER 109
Public Records
 
109.01   Public Records.
109.02   Record requests.
109.03   Costs for public records.
109.04   E-mail.
   109.01  PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   The City of Wickliffe, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code,
defines public records as including the  following: Any document that is
created or received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of, a public office
that documents the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures,
operations, or other activities of the office.  All records of the City of
Wickliffe are public unless they are exempt from disclosure under the Ohio
Revised Code.
   (b)   It is the policy of the City of Wickliffe that, as required by Ohio
law, records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily
available for inspection and copying. Record retention schedules are to be
updated regularly and a copy shall be kept at a location readily available to
the public.
(Res. 2008-03.  Passed 1-14-08.)
   109.02  RECORD REQUESTS.
   Each request for public records shall be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines.
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must use
reasonable effort to contact the requester for clarification, and should assist
the requester in revising the request by informing the requester of the manner
in which the City keeps its records.
   (b)   The requester does not need to put a records request in writing, and
does not need to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. Unless specifically required or authorized by state or
federal law or in accordance with Ohio R.C. 149.43(B), no public office or
person responsible for public records may limit or condition the availability
of public records by requiring disclosure of the requester's identity or the
intended use of the requested public record. Any requirement that the requester
disclose the requester's identity or the intended use of the requested public
record constitutes a denial of the request.  A public office or person
responsible for public records may ask a requester to make the request in
writing, may ask for the requester's identity, and may inquire about the
intended use of the information requested, but may do so only after disclosing
to the requester that a written request is not mandatory and that the requester
may decline to reveal the requester's identity or the intended use and when a
written request or disclosure of the identity or intended use would benefit the
requester by enhancing the ability of the public office or person responsible
for public records to identify, locate, or deliver the public records sought by
the requester.
   (c)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours with the exception of published holidays. Public records must be
made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be made
available within a reasonable period of time. “Prompt” and “reasonable” take
into account the volume of records requested, the proximity of the location
where the records are stored, and the necessity for any legal review of the
records requested.
   (d)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation
including legal authority.  If the request is in writing, the explanation for
denial of the request will be provided to the requester in writing.  If
portions of a record are public and portions are exempt, the exempt portions
are to be redacted and the rest released. If there are redactions, each
redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation, including legal
authority.
      (Res. 2008-03.  Passed 1-14-08.)
   109.03  COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of making
copies.
   (a)   The charge for paper copies is eight cents ($.08) per page.
   (b)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is the cost
of the disc.
   (c)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
   (d)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged eight cents ($.08) per page, or the cost of the computer disc, as well
as the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies. 
      (Res. 2008-03. Passed 1-14-08.)
   109.04  E-MAIL.
   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office. 
   (a)   Records in individual e-mail folders used to conduct public business
are subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of the City of
Wickliffe are instructed to retain their  e-mails that relate to public
business (See Section
109.01. Public Records) and to copy them to their business  e-mail folders and/
or to the City’s records custodian.
   (b)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from private folders as
records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining
them per established schedules, and making them available for inspection and
copying in accordance with the Public Records Act.

(Motion 1-2-76.)
   Rule 18.  Announcement and Change of Vote. 
   The Clerk shall, upon the request of any member, announce the vote taken on
any measure, at which time any member may change his vote; but no member shall
be permitted to change a recorded vote after the roll call has been announced
by the Clerk and the result declared by the presiding officer.
(Ord. 1994-23.  Passed 6-13-94.)
   Rule 19.  Recording of Vote of Absent Member. 
   Any member, having been unavoidably absent, may at the next meeting be
permitted to have their vote recorded upon any question acted upon during such
absence, provided that such vote shall not change the result, and provided
further that the member shall not be entitled to move a reconsideration of the
question to be voted upon.
   Rule 20.  Members Called to Order. 
   If any member in speaking or otherwise transgresses the rules of Council,
the presiding officer shall call the offending member to order. The member so
called to order shall immediately cease speaking, unless permitted by the
presiding officer to explain. Any member may, by raising the point of order,
call the attention of the presiding officer to such transgression. The point of
order shall be decided by the presiding officer without debate. Every such
decision of the presiding officer shall be subject to appeal to Council by any
two members.
   Rule 21.  Right of Appeal. 
   Any member may appeal to Council from a ruling of the presiding officer, and
if the appeal is seconded the member making the appeal may briefly state his
reason for the same, and the presiding officer may briefly explain his ruling;
but there shall be no debate on the appeal and no other member shall
participate in the discussion. The presiding officer shall then put the
question, "Shall the decision of the chair be sustained? If a majority of the
members present vote "aye", the ruling of the chair is sustained; otherwise it
is overruled. (Motion 1-2-76.) 
MOTIONS
   Rule 22.  Purpose and Form. 
   Motions shall be used only to expedite the orderly transaction of the
business of Council and shall not be substituted for resolutions or ordinances.
The form of all motions shall be "I move that" followed by the substance of the
motion. Upon demand of any member any motion shall be reduced to writing. Any
such motion may be withdrawn by the maker, with the consent of the second,
before it has been amended or voted upon. When a motion is made and seconded it
shall be stated by the presiding officer before any debate shall be in order.
All motions which have been entertained by the presiding officer shall be
entered in the minutes.
   Rule 23.  Precedence of Motions. 
   When a question is before Council, no motion shall be entertained except the
following:
   (a)    To adjourn.
   (b)    To fix the hour of adjournment.
   (c)    For the previous question.
   (d)    To lay on the table.
   (e)    To postpone to a day certain.
   (f)    To postpone indefinitely.
   (g)    To refer to a committee.
   (h)    To amend.
   These motions shall have precedence in the order indicated. The motion to
adjourn and the motion for the previous question shall be put to a vote without
debate; the motion to fix the hour of adjournment shall be debatable only as to
the time of such adjournment; and all other motions shall be debatable.
   Rule 24.  The Previous Question. 
   The motion for the previous question shall require a majority vote of all
members elected to Council; shall be considered only once; may be renewed after
intervening business; shall take precedence over all debatable questions and
shall be in order to prevent amendment of undebatable questions. When the
previous question is moved and seconded it shall be put as follows: "Shall the
main question be now put?". There shall be no further amendment or debate, but
pending amendments shall be put in their order before the main question. If the
question, “Shall the main question be now put?" is decided in the negative, the
main question shall remain before Council.
   Rule 25.  Motion to Lay on the Table. 
   The motion to lay on the table shall dispose finally of the legislation
against which it is invoked, but a motion to lay a pending amendment to an
ordinance or resolution shall not carry the ordinance or resolution with it. A
motion to lay on the table shall require a majority vote of all members elected
to Council.
   Rule 26.  Motion to Postpone to a Day Certain. 
   A motion to postpone to a day certain shall require a majority vote of the
members present; shall be subject to reconsideration; may be renewed after
intervening business; shall be debatable as to the propriety of the
postponement but not upon the merits of the legislation; and may be amended by
changing the date. Upon the arrival of the date to which postponed, the
legislation shall be considered in the regular order of business of that day.
   Rule 27.  Motion to Postpone Indefinitely. 
   The motion to postpone indefinitely shall have the same effect as a motion
to lay on the table, and shall require a majority vote of all members elected
to Council. A motion to postpone indefinitely shall not be reconsidered; shall
be debatable and shall open the legislation to debate; may be renewed after
intervening business; may not be amended or laid on the table; and shall be
subject to the previous question.
   Rule 28.  Reconsideration. 
   After the decision of any question, any member who voted with the majority
may move for a reconsideration of any action at the same or the next succeeding
meeting; however, a resolution authorizing or relating to any contract may be
reconsidered at any time before the final execution thereof. A motion to
reconsider shall require the same number of votes as is required to pass or
adopt an ordinance or resolution. After a motion for reconsideration has once
been acted upon, no other motion for a reconsideration thereof shall be made
without unanimous consent of the members present.
(Motion 1-2-76.)
ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS
   Rule 29.  Introduction. 
   Ordinances and resolutions shall be introduced in Council only in printed or

   In order that adequate time may be given to the preparation of legislation,
the Mayor or members of Council shall present requests for legislation to the
Director of Law not later than 5:00 p.m. on the Wednesday preceding the meeting
at which such legislation is to be introduced. 
(Ord. 1994-23.  Passed 6-13-94.)
   Rule 31.  Form. 
   The enacting clause of all ordinances and resolutions shall be, "Be it

Ohio", except ordinances submitted by initiative petition, which shall be, "Be
it Ordained by the People of the City of Wickliffe, Lake County, Ohio". No
ordinance or resolution shall be revived or amended unless the new ordinance or
resolution contains the entire ordinance or resolution revived, or the section
or sections so amended, and the section or sections so amended, shall be
repealed.
   Rule 32.  Emergency Ordinances and Resolutions. 
   If any emergency ordinance or resolution fails to receive a two-thirds
affirmative vote of all members elected to Council, such measure shall cease to
be before Council as an emergency measure and shall have the standing that a
measure would have had if it had not been read as an emergency measure.
(Motion 1-2-76.)
   Rule 33.  Three Readings. 
   No ordinance or resolution shall be passed or adopted until it has been read
on three separate days, unless the reading on three separate days has been
dispensed with by a two-thirds vote of all members elected to Council. The
final reading shall be in full unless a written or printed copy of the measure
shall have been furnished to each member of Council prior to such reading. When
it is desired to suspend this rule in order to permit passage of legislation
upon introduction, the question on the motion for such suspension shall be as
follows:  “Shall the Rules of Wickliffe City Council be suspended and Ordinance
No.            (Resolution No.) be placed on third and final reading?”.  If
two-thirds of all the members elected to Council vote “aye”, the
Charter, statutory and rule requirements requiring reading on three separate
days shall be suspended.
(Ord. 1994-23.  Passed 6-13-94.)
   Rule 34.  Amendments. 
   It shall be in order to amend an ordinance or resolution at any time when it
is not in the hands of a committee; but if it is amended after its second
reading it shall again be read as the second reading thereof and laid over for
further and final action. A majority vote of all the members elected to Council
shall be necessary for the adoption of an amendment to any legislation pending
before Council.
   Rule 35.  Passage or Adoption. 
   All ordinances and resolutions shall require for passage or adoption a
majority vote of all the members elected to Council. The vote on their passage
or adoption shall be taken by "yeas" and "nays" and entered on the records of
the meeting except as otherwise provided in these rules.
   Rule 36.  Signing Ordinances and Resolutions. 
   All ordinances passed and resolutions adopted by Council shall be signed by
the President of Council, attested by the Clerk and presented forthwith to the
Mayor for the Mayor’s signature.
   Rule 37.  Action on Mayor's Veto. 
   When the Mayor refuses to sign an ordinance or resolution or part thereof
and returns such ordinance or resolution to Council with his objections,
Council shall, not later than the next regular meeting, proceed to reconsider
the same. After the adoption of the motion so to reconsider, the question shall
be stated as follows: "Shall Ordinance No.         (Resolution No.       ) be
passed (adopted) notwithstanding the veto of the Mayor ? Those voting "aye"
vote to override the Mayor's veto. Those voting "nay" vote to sustain the
Mayor's veto. " If two-thirds of all the members elected to Council vote "aye",
such ordinance or resolution vetoed by the Mayor shall take effect without his
signature.
(Motion 1-2-76.)
SUSPENSION, AMENDMENT AND OTHER RULES
   Rule 38.  Suspension of Rules. 
   Any provision of these rules may be suspended at any meeting of Council,

1986.  No advance from any fund or account or order for payment may be made for
expenditures (other than expenditures excepted from such requirement under the

(Ord. 1991-30. Passed 4-8-91.)
   145.05 CREDIT CARD POLICY.
   (a)   Background.  The City of Wickliffe has developed this policy to
regulate the use of credit cards by City employees.  A credit card issued to
the City may also help minimize or eliminate the need for the use of personal
funds reimbursed to employees by expense report.  Other benefits may include an
expanded list of merchants from whom purchases can be made, accelerated payment
to the vendor, expedited delivery of goods, reduced paperwork, lower overall
transaction processing costs per purchase, and the ability to set and control
purchasing dollar limits.
   (b)   Authority.  This policy which is subject to change and revision will
among other things, set limits for spending, card activity and allowable
expenditures.  It establishes administrative controls that will be sufficient
for prudent use of a City credit card.  Finance Department internal accounting
controls have been incorporated herein.
   (c)   General Information.  A City credit is not intended to and will not be
used to avoid or bypass the competitive bidding requirements of the City of
Wickliffe, Charter, Article VII Section 7.  Further a City credit card is not
intended to avoid or bypass the appropriation of funds process, approval
process or payment process and related internal controls.  Rather, this policy
complements the established and existing processes.  Expenditures may not
exceed budgeted appropriations under any circumstances.
   Items and/or services purchased through the City credit card are only for
the official use of the City.  It is not and under no circumstances is to be
used as an ATM (automated teller machine) card, a debit card, or for cash
advances.  The City credit card is not to be used for personal or non-City
related purchases.
   A “Cardholder” is a City employee who is a department or division chief,
administrator, commissioner or director who has been approved by the Mayor to
pay for certain City-related expenses with a City credit card.  The Cardholder
is responsible for the security and physical custody of the card, and is
accountable for all transactions made with the card.  The Cardholder must
maintain possession of the City credit card and provide access to an Authorized
User to make a purchase.  The Cardholder must comply with the record keeping
requirements described in this policy (including retention of original
receipts) for the protection of both the Cardholder and the City.  The
following individuals are considered Cardholders:
 
Director of Finance    Administrative Assistant-City Hall
Police Chief           Building Commissioner
Fire Chief             Recreation Director
Service Director       Law Director
Service Superintendent
   An “Authorized User” is a City employee other than the Cardholder who has
actual, implied or apparent authority to use the City Credit card who may or
may not have possession of the City credit card or account number and whose use
results in a direct benefit for the City.  IN NO CASE MAY A NON-CITY EMPLOYEE
BE PERMITTED ACCESS TO OR MAKE A TRANSACTION WITH THE CITY CREDIT CARD.
   The City credit card carries corporate (City), not individual liability;
however, individual liability is imposed for inappropriate use. 
   The Cardholder’s personal credit history is not impacted in any way by the
use of the City credit card and credit checks are not done on individual
Cardholders. Billings for authorized purchases made within the limits of
appropriated amounts will be paid using City funds.
   (d)   Polices and Procedures.
      (1)   Credit Card Issuer. The credit card issuer (Chase Bank) provides a
City credit card issued with the City of Wickliffe and the Cardholder’s name
embossed on the face of the credit card.
      (2)   Contact with Credit Card Issuer.  This policy assigns the Director
of Finance as the primary point of contact between the City and the credit card
issuer.  The Director of Finance will be responsible for selecting the credit
card issue; the ordering and distributing of cards and the certification of
funds.  The Director of Finance will coordinate and troubleshoot problems
encountered with card use or vendor authorization and follow up on lost or
stolen cards.
   Any changes or updates to a Cardholder’s name or spending limits may be
initiated by the Director of Finance.
   The Finance Department will be responsible for timely reconciliation of the
billing statement. Cardholders, as well as other City employees, are
responsible to report instances of fraudulent use of a card and/or where the
City’s established procurement card policies and procedures are not being
followed.
   In addition, each Cardholder of a City credit card will be responsible for
processing and resolving disputes with merchants; reviewing and reconciling
card activity; and maintaining the Credit Card Purchasing Log.
      (3)   Credit and Transaction Limits.  The credit limit of the City credit
card is twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).  There are no credit card
transaction limits.
      (4)   Allowed and Prohibited Transaction.  The Cardholder and/or
Authorized User must obtain purchasing authority and certification of funds
prior to any purchase.  The City credit card may be appropriately used to
purchase the following:
   •    Training materials (subscriptions, books, video tapes)
   •    Office supplies
   •    Computer supplies, software
   •    Building maintenance materials and supplies
   •    Authorized travel expenses (including meals and related taxes and
gratuity)
   •    Fuel purchases approved as part of travel expenses
      (All travel-related expenses must be approved in advance through the
submission of a travel request form.)
   The City credit card may not be used to pay for the following:
   •    Cash Advances
   •    Any merchant, product, or service normally considered inappropriate by
City standards
   •    State of Ohio Sales and/or use tax
   •    Payments for orders partially received
   •    Issuer-defined Illegal Transactions
   •    Issuer-defined Prohibited Transactions
   •    Alcoholic beverages
   •    Fuel for a personal vehicle
   •    Tobacco products
   •    Financial services including ATM/cash machine access
   •    Adult products and services
   •    Equipment purchases
   •    Personal expenses
   Automated teller machine (ATM), cash advances, and all other cash-related
transactions are strictly prohibited. No late charges or finance charges shall
be permitted as allowable expenses.
      (5)   Sales and Use Tax.  Purchases made by the City are exempt from the
State of Ohio (or other Ohio jurisdictions) sales tax, therefore those
purchases made with the City credit card are tax-exempt.
         The Cardholder or Authorized User must present a tax exemption
certificate to the vendor and receive a credit for the unnecessary tax.
Incurring State of Ohio sales and/or use tax is a prohibited use. The
Cardholder and/or Authorized User will be subject to inappropriate use
procedures where State of Ohio sales and/or use tax is charged inappropriately.
      (6)   Control of Account.  The Director of Finance shall retain control
of the credit card account and shall establish a system to sign out credit
cards to Cardholders and Authorized Users. The Director of Finance and the
Council of the City of Wickliffe shall at least quarterly review the number of
cards and accounts issued, the cards' and accounts' expiration dates, and the
cards' and accounts' credit limits. If applicable, the Director of Finance
shall annually file a report with the Council of the City of Wickliffe
detailing all rewards received based on the use of the credit card account.
      (7)   Cardholder Acknowledgment and Responsibilities.  The Cardholder is
responsible for the physical custody of the City credit card, and for
maintaining confidentiality of all information relating to the City credit
card, such as the account number and expiration date. Neither the City credit
card nor the account number is not to be loaned to anyone or used by anyone
except the Cardholder or Authorized User.
         A Cardholder is responsible for any and all improper, fraudulent, or
inappropriate use of the card. Use of a City credit card for any use other than
an authorized or permitted use is a violation of law for purposes of Ohio
Revised Code 2913.21 .
         The Cardholder must acknowledge receipt of the City credit card to
assure that the Cardholder understands the intent of the program and agrees to
adhere to the policy and guidelines established herein. The Cardholder will be
required to sign a written acknowledgment of receipt of the card and
understanding of the applicable policies. The Director of Finance will retain
the signed acknowledgment.
      (8)   Making Purchases; Record-keeping.
         A.   Purchase Orders.  To ensure that expenditures do not exceed
available appropriations, an encumbrance must be established for each City
credit card purchase through a purchase order. The purchase order amount should
be set based on the monetary and transaction limits established for the City
credit card and projected spending.
         B.   Original Receipts.  When making a purchase, the Cardholder must
obtain and retain the original receipt. Every effort should be made to ensure
that the receipt contains the vendor's name, date of purchase, itemized
description of purchase, per unit price and extended price. A Cardholder will
be held personally liable for missing receipts and may be required to reimburse
the City for those billed purchases for which a receipt is not or cannot be
produced.
         C.   Internet, Telephone and Fax Purchases.  The City credit cards may
be used to purchase goods over the internet, telephone, or fax. These purchases
must be evidenced by a purchase order, written order confirmation along with
either the original packing slip that accompanied the purchased goods or an
itemized receipt.
            When using the internet, the Cardholder or Authorized User must
make sure the web site where the City credit card information is being placed
is secure, and that all account numbers are encrypted while being passed
electronically. A Cardholder can determine if the web site address is secure in
two ways:
            1.   An Internet web site is secure when the address changes from
http://www to https://www. The "s" stands for secure.
            2.   A symbol resembling a " lock" will appear at the bottom of the
browser. The "lock" symbol  signifies that the web site is secure and that all
card numbers will be encrypted when passed.
            Cardholders will be held responsible for all orders placed, even
those with vendors that turn out not to be legitimate businesses.
            The Cardholder should inform the vendor that the purchase will be
paid through the City Credit card, and that the purchase is tax exempt. The
Cardholder should also ensure the vendor will comply with the requirements of
items C (above), and E and F (below).
         D.   Declined Attempts.  The City credit card will be declined if one
of the embedded limits described above is exceeded, if the card issuer has a
security concern because of a spending pattern, or, sometimes if the "bill to"
address does not match the "ship to" address. Notify the Director of Finance if
a purchase is denied.
         E.   Agent, Acceptance or Service Fees.  Some vendors charge an agent,
acceptance or service fee in order to process a credit card charge. If the fee
is disclosed prior to the transaction, the allowable dollar limit on the fee is
five percent of the total bill, not to exceed twenty-five dollars ($25.00). If
the fee is not disclosed up-front, the Cardholder or Authorized User must
dispute the fee immediately, regardless of the fee amount. If the purchase is
being made on State of Ohio state term contract (through the Ohio Cooperative
Purchasing Program), the vendor is prohibited from charging additional fees for
use of a credit card. The Safety Director and the Director of Finance should be
notified immediately of this breach of contract.
         F.   Credit Card Purchasing Log.  Each Cardholder must maintain a
Credit Card Purchasing Log for each billing period during which a transaction
is made. Maintenance of the Log is a means to monitor activity within the
prescribed limits; a separate line is required for each purchase. The original
receipt for each purchase must be attached to the log to expedite
reconciliation with the billing statement. The Purchase Log and attached
receipts and completed purchase orders must be turned in to the Finance
Department monthly within the credit card billing cycle. The billing date of
the City credit card is the 12th day of each month. The Safety Director or
Director of Finance will review and sign the purchasing log prepared by each
Cardholder monthly. Cardholders may not review and authorize their own
purchases.
         G.   Monitoring Card Activity.  Certain City employees, such as the
Mayor, Safety Director, and the Director of Finance will have access to review
and monitor card activity. This review can occur at any time.
      (9)   Account Reconciliation and Payment of Procurement Card Billing. 
The Cardholder is responsible for reviewing and approving the Credit Card
Purchasing Log for the appropriateness of purchases. The approval must be
evidenced by the Cardholder's signature. Once approved for payment, the
Cardholder must submit the original purchasing log and supporting  receipts to
the Safety Director or Director of Finance for signature.
         Each Cardholder must turn in to the Finance Department the Purchasing
Log and detailed receipts within the credit card billing cycle. The billing
date of the City credit card is the 12th day of each month. The Director of
Finance will reconcile the Purchasing Log to the detailed receipts and the
monthly billing statements from the issuer for accuracy and authorization.
Payment will not be made until the Cardholder confirms  receipt of the goods or
services. Timely collection of purchase receipts and completion of the
Purchasing Log is imperative to avoid interest charges.
         There may be occasions when an item on the billing statement does not
match the purchasing log entry and/or retained receipt. For instance, the
amount may be incorrect. Under such circumstances the Cardholder must
immediately investigate the inaccuracy to attempt reconciliation.
      (10)   Returns, Credits and Dispute Resolution.  Sometimes, there is a
problem with a purchased item or service. Examples include, but are not limited
to: damaged merchandise, the billed amount does not match the quote, the billed
amount includes sales tax, the statement contains a charge not recognized by
the Cardholder, or the statement contains duplicate charges from a vendor. In
these instances, the Cardholder must attempt try to resolve the dispute with
the supplier or merchant. If the purchased item needs to be returned to the
supplier for any reason, the Cardholder must secure and document a credit given
to the City credit card account. The Director of Finance should be notified so
it may verify that the credit appears on a subsequent statement. The Cardholder
cannot accept cash or a rain check instead of a vendor credit to the City
credit card.
         If the dispute can not be resolved, the Cardholder should execute the
purchase dispute procedures set forth by the City credit card issuer and notify
the office of the Director of Finance so it may monitor the account statement.
      (11)   Late Fees or Finance Charges. No late fees or finance charges will
be paid by the City.
      (12)   Lost or Stolen Cards.  If the card is lost or stolen, the
Cardholder must notify the card issuer and Director of Finance immediately. 
Upon receipt of the phone call, written use of the card will be blocked. Prompt
action will reduce the liability for fraudulent charges. The Cardholder must
confirm the phone call by written notification to the card issuer via mail or
fax, (as may be required by the issuer's procedures) with copies to the
Director of Finance. The Credit Card Purchasing Log should be used to document
the date and time of the phone report of the lost or stolen card should be
included in the written notification. The Director of Finance will initiate
issuance of a replacement card.
      (13)   Suspension or Cancellation of Card.  When and if necessary, the
Mayor, Safety Director, Director of Finance or Cardholder will initiate
suspension or cancellation of the card, and will notify the Director of Finance
that such action has been taken. Cardholders who terminate their employment or
whose job duties change and no longer include purchasing must surrender the
card immediately. The Director of Finance will destroy canceled cards. 
Cardholders on extended leave or reassignment may have their card suspended.
Any use of the card for personal purchases or for purchases made in violation
of City policy will result in immediate card cancellation and possible
disciplinary action. See below Penalties for Improper Use of Card.
      (14)   Penalties for Improper Use of Card.  If it appears the Cardholder
(or Authorized User) has used the City credit card beyond the appropriated or
authorized amount or for an inappropriate or unlawful purpose, the Cardholder
must immediately notify the Director of Finance. When the Mayor determines that
the City should be reimbursed for City credit card expenditures beyond the
appropriated or authorized amount as provided in this policy, the Director of
Finance shall give written notice of the amount to be reimbursed by the
Cardholder. If within thirty (30) days after issuance of this written notice,
the City is not reimbursed for the full amount shown on the written notice, the
Director of Finance will file a police report to initiate the appropriate
investigation to recover that amount from the Cardholder.
         The City credit card is to be used only by the Cardholder or
Authorized User to pay for authorized, City related expenses. The Cardholder
may not allow the City credit card to be in the possession of someone other
than a City employee. The card may not be used to pay for personal
transactions. Improper use of the card can be considered misappropriation of
City funds. Misappropriation of City funds may result in disciplinary action up
to and including termination of employment. Improper use of the City credit
card can result in revoking the card. In addition, the Cardholder is personally
liable for payment of improper purchases, and subject to criminal prosecution.

custody of a law enforcement agency, shall be safely kept pending the time it
is no longer needed as evidence, and shall be disposed of pursuant to this
section. Every law enforcement agency that has lost, abandoned, stolen, seized
or forfeited property in its custody, except for property to be disposed of
under subsection (d)(4) hereof, shall maintain an accurate record of each item
of the property, which record shall include the date on which each item of
property came into the agency's custody, the manner in which it was disposed

   (b)    The law enforcement agency shall make a reasonable effort to locate
the persons entitled to possession of property in its custody, to notify them

notice to advertise in a newspaper of general circulation in the County,
briefly describing the nature of the property in custody, and inviting persons
to view and establish their right to it.

either of the following apply:
      (1)    The property was the subject, or was used in a conspiracy or
attempt to commit, or in the commission, of an offense other than a traffic
offense, and such person is a conspirator, accomplice or offender with respect
to the offense;
      (2)    When a court determines that the property should be forfeited
because, in light of the nature of the property or the circumstances of such
person, it is unlawful for him to acquire or possess the property.
   (d)    Unclaimed or forfeited property in the custody of a law enforcement
agency, shall be disposed of on application to and order of any court of record
that has territorial jurisdiction over the Municipality as follows:
      (1)   Drugs shall be destroyed, or shall be placed in the custody of the
Secretary of the Treasury of the United States for disposal or use for medical
or scientific purposes under applicable Federal law.

auction pursuant to subsection (d)(7) hereof. Other firearms and dangerous
ordnance shall be destroyed.
      (3)   Obscene material shall be destroyed.
      (4)   Beer, intoxicating liquor or alcohol seized from a person who is
not the holder of a permit issued under Ohio R.C. Chapters 4301 and 4303, or is
an offender, and forfeited to the State under Ohio R.C. 4301.45 or 4301.53
shall be sold by the Department of Liquor Control, if the Department determines
that the beer, intoxicating liquor or alcohol is fit for sale. If any tax
imposed under Ohio R.C. Title XLIII has not been paid in relation to the beer,
intoxicating liquor or alcohol, the proceeds of the sale shall first be used to

the Fire Chief in the aggregate two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for each

or insureds and the insurance company or companies, the named insured or

removing, repairing, or securing the building or other structure, shall

municipal corporation and the named insured or insureds from entering into an

   191.03  ADMISSIONS EXEMPT FROM TAX.
   No tax shall be levied under this chapter with respect to any admission all
the proceeds of which inure:
   (a)    Exclusively to the benefit of religious, educational or charitable
institutions, societies or organizations, societies or organizations for the
prevention of cruelty to children or animals, or societies or organizations
conducted for the sole purpose of maintaining symphony orchestras and receiving
substantial support from voluntary contributions, or of improving any municipal
corporation, or of maintaining a cooperative or community center moving picture
theater or swimming pool, if no part of the net earnings thereof inures to the
benefit of any private stockholder or individual.
   (b)    Exclusively to the benefit of persons in the military or naval forces
of the United States, or of National Guard organizations, reserve officer
associations or posts or organizations or war veterans, or auxiliary units or
societies of any such posts or organizations, if such posts, organizations,
units or societies are organized in the State of Ohio, and if no part of their
net earnings inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.
   (c)    Exclusively to the benefit of persons who have served in the military
or naval forces of the United States and are in need.
   (d)    Exclusively to the benefit of members of the police or fire
departments of any municipal corporation, or the dependents or heirs of such
members. 
   (e)    Exclusively to the benefit of the general revenue fund of any
municipal corporation or exclusively to the benefit of any fund of any
municipal corporation under the control of a recreation commission. This
exemption from the tax, however, shall not be allowed in cases wherein the
admission price is forty-one cents (41¢) or more. The exemption from tax
provided by this section shall, however, not be allowed in case of admissions
to wrestling matches, prize fights or boxing, sparring or other pugilistic
matches or exhibitions, unless exclusively for the benefit of those
organizations set forth in subsection (b) hereof, nor in the case of admissions
to any athletic game or exhibition the proceeds of which inure wholly or partly
to the benefit of any high school, academy, preparatory or other school, in
cases wherein the admission price is fifty-one cents (51¢) or more, or wholly
or partly to the benefit of any college or university. Immediately after the
event for which an exemption from admission tax has been allowed, the treasurer
of the institution, society or organization for whose benefit such event was
held shall file an itemized statement with the Director of Finance setting
forth the amount of money actually received by the treasurer, together with the
expenses of promoting and conducting the event. The statement shall be used as
a basis of subsequent requests for exemption from admissions tax for the
benefit of the institution, society or organization, and if the statement shows
a disproportionate expenditure for the promoting and conducting of the event in
relation to the profits, if any, no exemption shall thereafter be allowed to
the institution, society or organization. The exemption from tax provided in
this section shall not be allowed to any institution, society or organization
which does not control the sale of admissions to the event for which the
exemption is requested, nor shall any exemption be allowed where talent,
services or other items are compensated for on a percentage basis if the
percentage results in a payment in excess of the flat rate ordinarily charged
for the same talent, services or other items.
      (Ord. 1965-2. Passed 1-11-65.)
   191.04  COLLECTION OF TAX.
   Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
admission payment. The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be
deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until
paid to the Director of Finance as herein provided. Any person required to
collect the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the same, or
having collected the same, fails to remit the same to the Director of Finance
in the manner prescribed in this chapter, whether such failure is the result of
his own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control, shall
nevertheless be personally liable to the City for the amount of such tax, and
shall, unless the remittance be made as herein required, be guilty of a
violation of this section. The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the
time the admission charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any place
and shall be reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the
Director of Finance in monthly installments and remittances therefor on or
before the thirtieth day of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly
period in which the tax is collected or received. Payment or remittance of the
tax collected may be made by check, unless payment or remittance is otherwise
required by the Director of Finance, but payment by check shall not relieve the
person collecting the tax from liability for payment and remittance of the tax
to the Director of Finance, unless the check is honored and is in the full and
correct amount. The person receiving any payment for admissions shall make out
a return upon such forms and setting forth such information as the Director of
Finance may require, showing the amount of the tax upon admissions for which he
is liable for the preceding monthly period, and shall sign and transmit the
same to the Director of Finance with a remittance for the amount; provided that
the Director of Finance may in his discretion require verified annual returns
from any person receiving admission payments setting forth such additional
information as he may deem necessary to determine correctly the amount of tax
collected and payable.
   Whenever any theater, outdoor or drive-in theater, circus, show, exhibition,
entertainment or amusement makes an admission charge which is subject to the
tax herein levied, the same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which
the Director of Finance shall be the judge, the Director of Finance may require
the report and remittance of the admission tax immediately upon the collection
of the same, at the conclusion of the performance or exhibition, or at the
conclusion of the series of performances or exhibitions or at such other times
as the Director of Finance shall determine. Failure to comply with any
requirement of the Director of Finance as to report and remittance of the tax
as required shall be a violation of this section.
   The books, records and accounts of any person collecting the tax herein
levied shall, as to admission charges and tax collections, be at all reasonable
times subject to examination and audit by the Director of Finance. If the tax
imposed by this chapter is not paid when due there shall be added, as part of
the tax, interest at the rate of one percent per month from the time when the
tax became due until paid.
(Ord. 1965-2. Passed 1-11-65.)
   191.05  CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made shall on a form prescribed by the Director of Finance
make application and procure from the Director of Finance a certificate of
registration, the fee for which shall be two dollars ($2.00), which certificate
shall continue valid until December 31 of the year in which the same is issued.
The certificate of registration, or duplicate original copies thereof to be
issued by the Director of Finance without additional charge, shall be posted in
a conspicuous place in each ticket office or box office where tickets of
admission are sold.
(Ord. 1990-50. Passed 8-2-90.)
   191.06  CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION FOR TEMPORARY OR TRANSITORY AMUSEMENT.
   Whenever a certificate of registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lot or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section
191.04 by the owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting
the place. The applicant for a certificate of registration for such purpose
shall furnish with the application therefor the name and address of the owner,
lessee or custodian of the premises upon which the amusement is to be
conducted, and the owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the Director
of Finance of the issuance of the certificate and the joint liability for
collection and remittance of such tax.
(Ord. 1965-2. Passed 1-11-65.)
   191.07  RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Director of Finance shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations
not inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing
the payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied, and a copy of
the rules and regulations shall be printed and made available in the office of
the Director of Finance. Failure or refusal to comply with any such rules and
regulations shall be deemed a violation of this section.
(Ord. 1965-2. Passed 1-11-65.)
   191.08  EFFECTIVE DATE.

to collect the tax imposed by this chapter and coming into the possession of
the Director of Finance, or his agents and employees, shall be held
confidential. No person shall disclose information thereof unless ordered by a

may furnish the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Treasury Department of the United
States, with copies of returns filed.
(Ord. 1965-2. Passed 1-11-65.)
   191.99  PENALTY.

collecting or paying the taxes imposed by this chapter, willfully fails or

Director of Finance as required by this chapter, or to permit the Director of
Finance or his duly authorized agent to examine his books and other records, in

any return made or to ascertain and assess the tax imposed by this chapter if
no return was made, or to maintain and keep such books and other records for

the Director of Finance, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon
conviction thereof shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00);

portion of its net profit is attributable to that part of the business or
profession conducted within the boundaries of the City, then only such portion
shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the City for the purposes of
Municipal income taxation. The portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer
to be allocated as having been derived from within the City, in the absence of
actual records thereof, shall be determined as follows: Multiply the entire net
profits by a business allocation percentage to be determined by a three-factor
formula of property, payroll and sales, each of which shall be given equal
weight, as follows:
   (a)    The average net book value of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the City during
the taxable period of the average net book value of all the real and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
during the same period, wherever situated. As used in this paragraph, real
property includes property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of
such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by
eight.
   (b)    Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable period
to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed in the
City to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same period to
persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their services are
performed.
   (c)    Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed. In the event that the foregoing allocation formula
does not produce an equitable result, another basis may, under uniform
regulations, be substituted so as to produce such result.
      (Ord. 1967-12. Passed 3-13-67.)
   193.0702  SALES MADE IN THE CITY.
   As used in Section
193.0701(c) "sales made in the City" means
   (a)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
City regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a stock of
goods within the City.
   (b)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
City regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point
outside the City if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees
in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the sales result
from such solicitation or promotion.
   (c)    All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place
within the City to purchasers outside of the City regardless of where title
passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in
the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.

   193.0703  TOTAL ALLOCATION.
   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with subsections (a),
(b) and (c) of Section
193.0701 or such of the aforesaid percentages as are applicable to the
particular taxpayer and divide the total so obtained by the number of
percentages used in deriving that total in order to obtain the business
allocation percentage referred to in Section
193.0701. A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the City.
(Ord. 1967-12. Passed 3-13-67.)
   193.0704  RENTALS.
   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the computation of
net profits from business activities under Section
193.0501 (c), (d) and (e) only if and to the extent that the rental ownership,
management or operations of the real estate from which such rentals are derived
(whether so rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through
agents or other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the
taxpayer in whole or in part.
   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties, regardless of
number and value, aggregates in excess of one hundred twenty-five dollars
($125.00) per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of such properties is a business activity of
such taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to
tax. However, in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds one hundred twenty-five dollars
($125.00) per month; and in the case of farm property the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in crops or when the
rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from the
farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds one hundred twenty-five dollars
($125.00) per month, and the person who operates a licensed rooming house shall
be considered in business whether or not the gross income exceeds one hundred
twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per month.

following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating
loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.

City in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to the
City.

in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.

chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable

quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of each

   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator.  A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the  Municipality requires all resident individual
taxpayers to file a tax return under section
194.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying

disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal

in section
194.051 of this Chapter.

      (2)     For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick

         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold

remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
194.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
194.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum

corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or filed
late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at the
rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
section
194.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld. 
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer. 
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
194.03(23). 
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
194.03(1) of this Chapter.

telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a

the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
194.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
194.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal  income tax liability. If
a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the

         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from

sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
194.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
194.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. 
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of 194.03 of
this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
194.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
194.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
194.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
194.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and  are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return

      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty

annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
194.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The  taxpayer  is  an  individual  who  resides  in  the
Municipality  but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

   194.081 RESIDENT SUBJECT TO TAX IN OTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   When a resident of the City of Wickliffe is subject to a municipal income
tax in another municipality of the same income taxable under this chapter, a
credit shall be allowed against City of Wickliffe income tax of the amount of
net tax for which he is liable under the ordinance of such other municipality
but such credit shall not exceed the amount of the tax due hereunder. Provided,
however, that a resident of the City of Wickliffe shall not be entitled to such
credit in the event he or she shall fail, neglect or refuse to timely file a
return or form as is prescribed by the Administrator and required by this

(Ord. 2015-44.  Passed 12-21-15.)
   194.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.  (Ord. 2015-44.  Passed 12-21-15.)
   194.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
194.081 of this Chapter.  (Ord. 2015-44.  Passed 12-21-15.)
   194.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
194.096 of this Chapter. 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section 194.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable
credit equal to the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality against
the income tax the Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate
is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the tax rates is also
subject to collection by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest
accruing during the period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
194.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section 194.081 of this
Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. 
(Ord. 2015-44.  Passed 12-21-15.)
   194.09  ANNUAL RETURN.
   194.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)    An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal Taxable Income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection
194.051(C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,

file an annual municipal income tax return with the Municipality, regardless of

   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. 
Such duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer. 
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.  Such fiduciary
shall provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to
support that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the
taxpayer.  This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040 or, in the case of a return or request required by a qualified
municipal corporation, Ohio IT 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return
or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.   
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator. 
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

Tax Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net

end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period.  The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual,  no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
194.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
194.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
194.092 of this Chapter prevails. 
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
194.051 of this Chapter. 
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in section
194.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld. 
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.  Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)     When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
194.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall include the
following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from
performing an audit of the person.

otherwise due to the Municipality  before the one hundred eighty-first day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)

file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of

the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.  (Ord. 2015-44.  Passed 12-21-15.)
   194.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)     Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)     The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)     Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.  (Ord. 2015-44.  Passed 12-21-15.)
   194.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)     Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (B)     Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax

income tax return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return.  If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)     An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)     If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return.  The extended due date of the
municipal income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the
state income tax return.  (Ord. 2015-44.  Passed 12-21-15.)
   194.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section
194.19 of this Chapter  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed

the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in section
194.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  (Ord. 2015-44.  Passed 12-21-15.)

withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten

   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
194.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section

Passed 12-21-15.)
   194.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal

inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction

records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession

accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
194.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section

section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.

Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2015-44.  Passed 12-21-15.)
   194.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.

Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718. 
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
and  may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code. 
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment,  the manner in which the taxpayer
may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be
directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-44.  Passed 12-21-15.)
   194.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.

period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
194.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
194.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final  determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
194.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
194.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator, to adopt
rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.

   194.97  COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the
aforesaid period are fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the
collection of taxes or for the punishment of violations of this chapter have
been fully terminated, subject to the limitations contained in Section
194.19.
   (B)     Annual returns due for all or any part of the last effective year of
this chapter shall be due on the date provided in Section
194.091 as though the same were continuing.
(Ord. 2015-44.  Passed 12-21-15.)
   194.98  SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter.  It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter.
(Ord. 2015-44.  Passed 12-21-15.)

   195.01  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the terms, phrases, words and their
derivatives shall have the following meanings. The singular shall include the
plural, and the masculine shall include the feminine and the neuter.
   (a)    "Administrator" means the Tax Administrator.
   (b)    "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered for consideration to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for
the accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several
structures.
   (c)    "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for

      (Ord. 1975-6. Passed 2 -24 -75.)
   195.02  LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   It is the intent of this chapter to levy the excise tax of three percent on
transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient
guests as referred to and authorized by Ohio R.C. 5739.02(C). Accordingly, this
chapter shall be construed to effectuate that purpose and so as to be
consistent with any requirement of law, compliance with which is a prerequisite
to the validity of the tax intended to be levied hereby.
(Ord. 1975-6. Passed 2-24-75.)
   195.03  PURPOSE, RATE AND APPLICATION.
   (a)    There is hereby levied an excise tax on transactions by which lodging
by a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient guests of three percent of the
amount paid or to be paid by the transient guests for the lodging for the
purpose of providing revenue with which to help meet the needs of the City.
   Such tax, to be known as the transient guest tax, applies and is collectible
at the time the lodging is furnished, regardless of the time when the price is
paid. The tax does not apply to lodging furnished to the State or any of its
political subdivisions.
   (b)    For the purposes of the proper administration of this chapter and to
prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by
hotels in the City to transient guests is subject to the tax until the contrary
is established.
(Ord. 1975-6. Passed 2-24-75.)
   195.04  TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY TAX.
   The transient guest tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the
transient guest to the vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient
guest the full and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging. The
tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be deemed to be held in
trust by the vendor until paid to the Administrator, as provided in Section
195.06. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the vendor, the
Administrator may require that such tax be paid directly to the Administrator.
   No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time
rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the
Administrator.
(Ord. 1975-6. Passed 2-24-75.)
   195.05  RECORDS, INSPECTION, DESTRUCTION.
   (a)    The transient occupancy tax shall be stated and charged separately
from the charge for the lodging and shown separately on any record thereof, at
the time when the occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon
every evidence of occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for such
occupancy issued or delivered by the vendor.
   (b)    No vendor shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or
indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the
vendor, or that it will not be added to the amount charged for the lodging, or
that, if added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 1975-6. Passed 2-24-75.)
   195.06  RETURNS REQUIRED.
   (a)    Each vendor shall on or before the last day of the month make and
file a return for the preceding month, on forms prescribed by the
Administrator, showing the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax
due from the vendor to the City for the period covered by the return, and such
other information as the Administrator deems necessary for the proper
administration of this chapter. The Administrator may extend the time for
making and filing returns. Returns shall be filed by delivering or mailing the
same to the Administrator together with payment of the full amount of tax shown
to be due thereon.
   (b)    The Administrator may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not
such as to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Administrator upon the
basis of administrative costs of the City, to make and file returns at less
frequent intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate
the intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   (c)    All claims for exemption from tax filed by transient guests with the
vendor during the reporting period shall be filed with the return.
   (d)    All returns and payments submitted by each vendor shall be treated as
confidential by the Administrator and shall not be released by him except upon
order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the
United States, the State, the County, or the City, for official use only.
   (e)    The Administrator, if he deems it necessary in order to insure the
payment of the tax imposed by this chapter may require returns and payments to
be made for other than monthly periods. The returns shall be signed by the
vendor or his authorized agent.
(Ord. 1975-6. Passed 2-24-75.)
   195.07  REFUNDS.
   The Administrator shall refund or grant credits to vendors for the amount of
taxes paid illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous
assessment where the vendor had not reimbursed himself from the transient
guest. A transient guest may obtain a refund or credit for the amount of taxes
paid illegally or erroneously, but only when the tax was paid by the transient
guest directly to the Administrator. No refund shall be paid unless the
claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement
thereto and makes a claim in writing on forms furnished by the Administrator,
stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is
founded. Such claim shall be filed with the Administrator within three years of
the date of payment.
(Ord. 1975-6. Passed 2-24-75.)
   195.08  FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION BY ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)    If any vendor fails or refuses to collect the transient guest tax or
to file a return and to make a remittance of such tax or any portion thereof,
as required by this chapter, the Administrator shall proceed in such manner as
he may deem best to obtain information on which to base his estimate of the tax
due. When the Administrator has such information as he is able to obtain upon
which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by
any vendor who has failed or refused to collect the same or to file a return
and to make a remittance of the proper amount thereof, he shall proceed to
determine and assess against such vendor the tax and penalty provided for in
this chapter.
   (b)    In case such determination is made, the Administrator shall give
notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by registered or
certified mail. Such vendor may within ten days after the serving or mailing of
such notice make application in writing to the Administrator for a hearing on
the amount assessed. If application by the vendor is not made within the time
prescribed, the tax, and penalty, determined by the Administrator shall become
final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is
made, the Administrator shall give not less than five days written notice in
the manner prescribed in this section to the vendor to show cause at a time and
place fixed in such notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed
for such tax and penalty. At any such hearing, the vendor may appear and offer
evidence why such specified tax and penalty should not be so fixed. After such
hearing, the Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and
shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in
this section of such determination and the amount of such tax and penalty. The
amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days.
(Ord. 1975-6. Passed 2-24-75.)
   195.09  APPEALS.
   Appeals from any ruling or determination of the Administrator with respect
to the amount of such tax and penalty shall be made as provided.

be deemed a debt owed by the vendor to the City.  Any person owing money to the
City under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought
in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount; or in the alternative,
after notice of the delinquent amounts due for the transient tax, the transient
tax sum shall be certified to the  Lake County Auditor for collection, the same
as other taxes and assessments are collected.
(Ord. 2009-48.  Passed 9-14-09.)

payment, collections and remittance of the transient guest tax.
(Ord. 1975-6. Passed 2-24-75.)
   195.12  SEVERABILITY.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter or any tax imposed
as specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter and shall not affect or impair any of
the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other parts of this
chapter.
   It is hereby declared to be the intention of Council that this chapter would
have been adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence,
clause, section or part thereof not been included herein.
(Ord. 1975-6. Passed 2-24-75.)

(ORC 4513.60)
   303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.  If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
         C.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times, the
times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
         D.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of

a place of storage within twenty-five linear miles.
         B.   It is well-lighted.
         C.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly scheduled

posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains

operators to be  licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
   The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken

record of the time and date, in electronic or printed form, for at least thirty
days after the date on which the vehicle is recovered by the owner or
lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:

      (2)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed
from private property in the Chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a
private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains

manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if

   313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
   313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.

offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided

and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. 
The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been

this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years.  The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13.  (ORC 4511.19)

a jail term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to
the thirty-day mandatory jail term.  Notwithstanding the jail terms set forth
in Section
303.99, the additional jail term shall not exceed one year, and the cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed one year.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into

offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation

be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

   339.14  WEIGHING VEHICLE; SCALES TO BE USED; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD;
ALTERATION OF WEIGHT LIMITS.
   (a)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of such vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined load of
all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway vehicle, or a
sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or unloaded. The
driver of such vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed to the
nearest available of such sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided
such scales are within three miles of the point where such vehicle is stopped.
Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the police
officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as prescribed by
this section. All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and
its load shall be annually compared by a Municipal, County or State sealer with
the State standards or standards approved by the State and such scales shall
not be sealed if they do not conform to the State standards or standards
approved by the State.
   (b)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
   (c)   During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on terrain of sufficient length and width
to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be level,
or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in elevation
between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-fourth
inch per foot of the distance between such axles. Whenever compact, self-
contained, portable, sealed scales specially adapted to determining the wheel
loads of vehicles on highways are used, the weights determined are not unlawful
unless they exceed by more than three percent the weight limitations set forth
in this chapter.
   (d)   In all determination of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, twelve feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.

and free of dust and gravel. The dimensions of such landing and take-off area
shall be at least twice the length of any helicopter using it. Such area shall
be set aside exclusively for taking-off and landing, shall be free of trees,
wires or other obstructions and shall be enclosed by a fence at least two feet
in height.
   Every helistop shall have at least two approach paths free and clear of
obstructions extending outward and upward from the landing and take-off area at
an angle of eight feet horizontally to one foot vertically, flaring to a width
of 500 feet at an altitude of 500 feet. The centerline of such approach paths
or planes shall be separated by an arc of at least 135 degrees. The remaining
peripheral area surrounding the landing and take-off area shall be free and
clear of obstructions at an angle of two feet horizontally to one foot
vertically to a lateral distance of 250 feet from the landing and take-off

impartial, speedy and sure administration of justice.

previous conviction of or plea of guilty to a violation of a section of the
Codified Ordinances or Ohio Revised Code or of a division of a section of the
Codified Ordinances or Ohio Revised Code shall be construed to also refer to a

   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:

any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy.  In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that

   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.

network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications

(ORC 2901.11)
   501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
 
   501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
   501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity

offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a

   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit

(Ord. 2004-3.  Passed 1-26-04.)
   501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
 
   (b)   Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender's term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender's participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
 
   (c)   Organizations.   Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

   545.02  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of

involved in the offense.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

section or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise
prohibited by law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is not
contraband, the officer shall return the firearm to the person at the

separate enclosure in that compartment that does not contain the firearm and
that closes using a snap, button, buckle, zipper, hook and loop closing
mechanism, or other fastener that must be opened to access the contents or the
firearm is contained within a separate enclosure of that nature in that
compartment that does not contain the magazine or speed loader;
               b.   A pocket or other enclosure on the person of the person in

within all or any portion of the City may be granted by Council to any person,
whether operating under an existing franchise or not, offering to furnish and

interest not to grant the franchise or to restrict the number of grantees to
one or more.
(Ord. 1981-74. Passed 9-28-81.)
   719.04  INSURANCE.

received from CATV operations in the City provided that the FCC certifies,
after appropriate showing is made by the grantee, that a franchise fee in
excess of three percent (3%) but no greater than five percent (5%) will not
interfere with the effectuation of federal regulatory goals in the field of
CATV; and after appropriate showings made by Council that the franchise fee in
excess of three percent (3%) but no greater than five percent (5%) is
appropriate in light of the City's planned regulatory program for CATV.

the end of the term, grantee shall immediately submit to the City a financial
statement prepared as required before, showing the gross subscriber revenues of
grantee for the time elapsed since the last period for which grantee has paid

sums legally due and owing to the City.
   (c)    In the event that any payment is not made on or before the applicable
date fixed in subsections (a) and (b) hereof, interest on such overdue payments
shall be paid from such date. The rate of interest to be paid on such overdue
payments shall be either eight percent (8%) per year or the current prime rate
of interest in effect at that time, less five percent (5%), whichever rate may
be higher. 
   (d)    The City shall have the right to inspect grantee's records showing
the gross receipts from which its franchise payments are computed and shall
have the right of audit and recomputation of any and all amounts paid under the
franchise. No acceptance of any payment by the City shall be construed a
release of or an accord or satisfaction of any claim the City might have for
further or additional sums payable under the terms of this chapter or for any
other performance or obligation of grantee hereunder.
   (e)    Payments of compensation made by grantee to the City pursuant to the

hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), and upon completion of the original
construction and installation the performance bond shall be reduced to the
penal sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for a period of two years, and
thereafter, the penal sum of such bond may be reduced to the amount of twenty-
five thousand dollars ($25,000) as provided herein.

      (2)    The grantee may establish rates for service from time to time
thereafter by filing with the Clerk of Council a schedule of rates proposed and
by notifying its subscribers in writing at least sixty days prior to
implementation of the rate change.
      (3)    Council shall have the right to determine whether or not it shall
assume rate regulation authority when the grantee achieves sixty percent
penetration of its potential subscribers. If Council declines rate regulation
authority, then rates may be modified by the grantee as specified in subsection
(b)(2) hereof. If Council assumes rate modification authority, then for the
next three years rates shall be subject to modification only by Council and
only in accordance with the following procedures.

         B.    The grantee may petition Council for a change in rates by
filing, in triplicate, a proposed rate schedule with the Clerk of Council, such
petition shall include the justification(s) for the proposed schedule. Such
petition shall be filed at least ninety days prior to the requested
implementation date of the rate change. One copy of the petition shall remain
on file with the Clerk of Council and be open for public inspection.
         C.    Within ten days of notification by Council of the place and time
established for a hearing on such petition, the grantee shall notify its
subscribers of the hearing by announcement on at least two channels of its
system between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. for five consecutive days.
Additionally, hearings shall be announced in a newspaper of general circulation
at least five days before the date of the hearing. Following all proper notice
but in no event later than ninety days from the date of such petition, Council
shall hold an appropriate public hearing to consider the proposed new rates, at
the hearing all parties desiring to be heard, including the grantee, shall be
heard on any matters relating to the performance of this franchise, the
grantee's services, and the proposed new rates.

written decision on the grantee's position, either accepting, rejecting or
modifying the same and reciting the basis of its decision.
         E.    If Council fails to act within ninety days of the grantee's
petition filed pursuant to subsection (b)(3)B. hereof, the grantee shall
thereafter be entitled to put its proposed new rates into effect on a
provisional basis, provided that it shall keep a full and accurate accounting
of all income resulting from such provisional rates and shall be obliged, for a
period of six months thereafter, to refund the amount by which such provisional
rates exceed the rates ultimately established by Council. Upon request by
Council, the grantee shall provide a bond or other reasonable surety to ensure
that possible refunds due under this subsection shall be promptly made. The
bond or surety shall be in an amount not to exceed the difference between the
amount of revenues generated in six months at the previously existing rates and
the amount of revenues expected to be generated in six months at the
provisional rates. Such bond shall be in a form approved by the Law Director.
         F.    The criteria for Council's decision in such matters shall be the
establishment of rates which are fair and reasonable to both the grantee and
its subscribers and shall be generally defined to be the minimum rates
necessary to meet all applicable costs of service, including fair return on all
invested capital, all assuming efficient and economical management.

interpretations and calculations of the financial and statistical information
provided by the grantee may be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction.

and all rates and charges so as not to give preference to nor discriminate

attract new subscribers or for subscribers who pay promptly;
      (2)    Reasonable policies for deposits, penalties or denial of service
where a particular subscriber has proven a bona fide credit problem; or

renewals thereof upon the payment of the annual license fees.

examined and found to be in a thoroughly safe condition for the transportation
of passengers; clean, fit, of good appearance, and well painted and varnished.
The Public Safety Director shall thereafter make inspections of the vehicles at

provision obligating the surety company to give ten days written notice before
cancellation of the bond to the Safety Director, the license to expire on the

dollars ($40,000) for injury to more than one person and five thousand dollars

   1106.01  OBJECTIVE.
   It shall be the objective of grading regulations to provide grading which
shall divert surface water away from buildings and dispose of such water
without harmful effects on neighboring property to preserve desirable site
features and to provide grades and gradients for safe and convenient access to
and around buildings and lot for their normal use and maintenance. The final
grade at the building shall not be closer than eight inches to the wood or
other corrodible siding or exterior trim.
(Ord. 1986-21. Passed 4-28-86.)
   1106.02  SURFACE DRAINAGE.
   (a)    Positive drainage shall be provided for each lot or plot by proper
draining so that a nuisance shall not be created. Catch basins and in some
cases properly connected under-drains shall be installed, or other approved
provisions made where water may pocket, to preclude the accumulation of surface
water. Regrading shall be done so that existing natural ground drainage of the
surrounding area shall not be impeded.
   (b)    The Building Commissioner may adopt rules or plans for the drainage
of lots or plots which rules or plans shall be followed by the owner unless
permission for deviation is given by the Planning Commission and/or Board of
Zoning Appeals. When a lot or plot is graded to a higher or lower level than
the natural grade on an adjacent property, the owner of such lot or plot shall
provide suitable slopes or retaining walls or other protection approved by the
Building Commissioner on his own property to preserve the natural slope of
surface elevation of such adjacent property.
(Ord. 1986-21. Passed 4-28-86.)
   1106.03  FOOTING DRAINS.
   When a floor is below the adjoining ground and subsoil conditions are such
as to permit ground water to accumulate adjacent to the foundation, footing
drains shall be installed alongside the outside face of the base of the
foundation. Such drains shall be not less than four inches diameter pipe of a
type and construction to intercept and carry ground water without permitting
the infiltration of soil into the pipe. Footing drains shall have a continuous
slope of not less than one-sixteenth inch per foot, discharging into the
building storm sewer or other outlet approved by the Building Commissioner.
(Ord. 1986-21. Passed 4-28-86.)
   1106.04  BACKFILL OVER FOOTING DRAINS.
   The backfill over footing drains shall be pervious material of the type,
size and graduation required for the particular type of drain construction
being used and shall be carried up at least eighteen inches over drain tile but
not closer than twelve inches of the established surface grade. The top twelve
inches of the backfill shall consist of six inches of an impervious (clay)
soil, topped with six inches of a clayey top soil if the surface is to be
covered with lawn or shrubs. If the surface adjacent to the foundation wall is
to be paved or have some similar treatment, then the backfill near the top may
be a suitable base for such construction.
(Ord. 1986-21. Passed 4-28-86.)
   1106.05  ROOF AND YARD DRAINAGE; DISCONNECTION PERMITS.
   Unless otherwise specifically approved by the Building Commissioner, roof
drainage shall be handled by suitable collectors and downspouts, which shall
discharge into a sealed, jointed storm drain of not less than four-inch
diameter with a slope of one-fourth inch or more per foot.  Where a storm sewer
or other storm drainage outlet is not available or where a disconnection permit
application is submitted and granted, downspouts may discharge onto other
devices approved by the Building Commissioner provided that no excess water
shall flow onto adjoining property or over sidewalks.  A disconnection permit
shall be revoked upon evidence that excess water flows onto adjoining property
or over sidewalks.  The storm drain outlet carrying roof water or yard drainage
shall be not less than six-inch diameter and shall not connect to the footing
drain, but may intercept and receive the outlet of the footing drainage by a
wye connection above the spring line.  Connection of any pipe carrying roof
water or yard drainage to a sanitary sewer is prohibited.

      (Ord. 1986-57. Passed 11-24-86.)
   1107.02  APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY SITE PLAN; FINISHED GROUND GRADE AND GRADE
OF FOUNDATION.
   (a)    Upon receipt of the application and site plan, as described in
Section
1107.01, the Building Commissioner shall, if all other aspects of the
application for the permit are in order, submit a copy of the application and
site plan to the City Engineer. The Engineer shall examine such site plan for
conformity to the proper relation with existing or proposed sanitary sewers,
water lines, storm drainage and existing grades of adjacent lands and
buildings, following the guidelines of subsection (b) hereof. If the plan does
not so conform, the Engineer shall call the applicant's attention to the lack
of conformity and require that the plan be changed in that respect. When the
Engineer finds that the plan so conforms, he or she shall approve the same and
return it to the Building Commissioner. Such approved plan shall be a condition
of any permit which may be issued pursuant to this chapter for such
construction. It shall then be the responsibility of the applicant to perform
all work in conformity with the various grades and elevations of the final
approved site plan and to set witness markers clearly designating the lot
corners.
   (b)    The finished ground grade of each building shall be established in
proper relation to the surrounding grade, driveway and street. The lot shall be
graded so that water drains away from each building at a minimum grade of two
percent (2%). Surface drainage swales shall have a minimum grade designed so
that surface water shall drain onto a driveway, street gutter, storm sewer,
drain inlet or natural drainage way. The minimum grades of driveways shall be
four-tenths percent (.4%), and a maximum of fifteen percent (15%). Grading
shall be adjusted so there shall be no abrupt grades in the front yards and
along side lot lines. The grades of earth terraces shall not exceed two and
one-half to one. If a masonry retaining wall exceeds three feet in height, a
hedge, fence or railing shall be provided.
   (c)    At such time as the builder or other permit holder has constructed
the foundation or slab referred to in Section
1107.01(h), he or she shall request, through the Building Commissioner, that
the City Engineer check the grade. No further construction shall be permitted
until the Engineer has checked the elevation of such foundation and found it to
be in accordance with the site plan approved pursuant to subsection (a) hereof.
   (d)    When the builder or other permit holder has constructed the subbase
of the hard surface paved area and other areas that require grade changes, as
indicated on their submitted approved plan, the permit holder shall request,
through the Building Commissioner, that the City Engineer check the grade. No
further construction shall be permitted until the City Engineer has checked the
elevation of the required areas and found it to be in accordance with the plot
plan approved pursuant to subsection (a) hereof.
(Ord. 1986-57. Passed 11-24-86.)
   1107.03  FINAL SITE PLAN.
   Upon completion of construction and before a certificate of occupancy is
issued for a building by the Building Commissioner, each applicant shall file
with the City Engineer a final plot plan, which shall show the final grades of
the improvement as constructed. Such plan shall be certified, by a registered
civil engineer or surveyor, as to the accuracy of the plan in depicting the
actual construction. Such civil engineer or surveyor shall also certify that he
or she has made an actual field observation of as-built conditions and that
such conditions are as shown on the plan. The form of such certification shall
be prescribed by the City Engineer.

   The City Engineer shall estimate the cost of the site plan review. If the
estimated cost exceeds the deposit, the applicant shall be informed of the
estimated costs and shall be directed to deposit the difference between the
Engineer's estimate and the applicant's original deposit, which difference
shall be deposited prior to the Engineer's examination of such site plan.
   (b)    The applicant shall be charged for the actual costs incurred by the
City Engineer for the review of the site plan, inspection of the site and
checking of the grade, and any and all other expenses associated with the site
plan review. Such costs shall be computed on the basis and in accordance with
the legislation governing the right of compensation for the City Engineer at
the time. Any deficiency between the actual costs of the services rendered by
the City Engineer and the deposit paid by the applicant, shall be paid to the
City prior to the approval of the final site plan. Any excess of the deposit
over the actual costs of the City Engineer and the permit fee shall be returned
to the applicant.

1115.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution, grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety and general welfare of its
citizens.  Therefore, the City Council of City of Wickliffe, State of Ohio,
does ordain as follows.
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Wickliffe has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base.  Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.  In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
(11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Wickliffe as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City of Wickliffe.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Lake County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Lake County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective February 3, 2010.
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Wickliffe as required by Section
1115.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations.  Such maps and/or
studies are on file at Wickliffe City Hall, 28730 Ridge Road, Wickliffe, Ohio
44092.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances (resolutions) including Subdivision
Regulations, Zoning or Building Codes.  In the event of a conflict between
these regulations and any other ordinance (resolution), the more restrictive
shall be followed.  These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction,
covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be
governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.  Where a provisions of these regulations may be in conflict
with a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence
over these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.  Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions.  Flood heights may be increased by man-made
or natural causes.  These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas
of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage.  These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Wickliffe, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.  (Ord. 2010-
05.  Passed 1-11-10.)
1115.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure: A structure on the same lot width, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal: A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.

exceeded in any given year.  The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Seal Level (MSL).  In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).

equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See “Lowest Floor”.
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community. 
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus two (2) feet of freeboard.  In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   Floodway: A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge.  A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height.  In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management.  Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register.
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio’s inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Wickliffe’s historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. 
LOMCs are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area.  A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. 
One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria.  A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest Floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure.  This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.  The term
“manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle”.  For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27- 01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park.  A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding.  This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. 
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the “start of construction”
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Wickliffe Flood
Insurance Rate Map, January 2, 1980, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association or any other entity, including State and local
governments and agencies.  An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised
Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but
is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau,
society, council, institution, state college or university, community college
district, technical college district, or state community college.  “Agency”
does not include the General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant
General’s Department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis,
      (2)   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.   
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year.  Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30 and A99.  Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date.  The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation.  Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.  For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement.  This term includes structures, which have
incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. 
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction”,
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   (kk)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 2010-05.  Passed 1-11-10.)

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of WIckliffe’s flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1115.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that the technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available.  These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1115.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA.  Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details.  Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Wickliffe, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Wickliffe have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area.  In order that the
City of Wickliffe’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Wickliffe boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Wickliffe suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Wickliffe has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations.  Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA.  Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.

boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1115.05.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.  After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to

actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B. items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. 
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage”.  The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based
on methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source.  For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished.  Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse.  Evidence of such
notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.  The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Wickliffe specifying the maintenance responsibilities.  If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1115.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
   (j)   Fill.  The following standards apply to all fill activities in special
flood hazard areas:
      (1)   Fill sites, upon which structures will be constructed or placed,
must be compacted to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with the Standard
Proctor Test method or an acceptable equivalent method.
      (2)   Fill slopes shall not be steeper than one foot vertical to two feet
horizontal.
      (3)   Adequate protection against erosion and scour is provided for fill
slopes.  When expected, velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of
five feet per second armoring with stone or rock protection shall be provided. 
When expected, velocities during the base flood are five feet per second or
less protection shall be provided by covering them with vegetative cover.
      (4)   Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material.

and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance.  The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of
Wickliffe.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator.  Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires.  In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property.  Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
have been fully considered.  As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre,
the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses.  A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance
and service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision.  The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 2010-05.  Passed 1-11-10.)

            xi.   The location of permanent SCMs to be used to control
pollutants in stormwater after construction operations have been completed.
            xii.   Areas designated for the storage or disposal of solid,
sanitary and toxic wastes, including dumpster areas, areas designated for
cement truck washout, and vehicle fueling.
            xiii.   Methods to minimize the exposure of building materials,
building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt.
            xiv.   Measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and
leaks. Applicants may also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill
Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs,
Safety Response Plans, etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement
and a copy of such plan is maintained on site.
            xv.   Methods to minimize the discharge of pollutants from
equipment and vehicle washing, wheel wash water, and other wash waters. No
detergents may be used to wash vehicles. Wash waters shall be treated in a
sediment basin or alternative control that provides equivalent treatment prior
to discharge.
            xvi.   The location of designated stoned construction entrances
where the vehicles will ingress and egress the construction site.
            xvii.   The location of any in-stream activities including stream
crossings.
      (4)   A soils engineering report.  The City Engineer may require the SWP3
to include a Soils Engineering Report based upon his/her determination that the
conditions of the soils are unknown or unclear to the extent that additional
information is required to protect against erosion or other hazards. This
report shall be based on adequate and necessary test borings, and shall contain
all the information listed below.  Recommendations included in the report and
approved by the City Engineer shall be incorporated in the grading plans and/or
other specifications for site development.
         A.   Data regarding the nature, distribution, strength, and
erodibility of existing soils.
         B.   If applicable, data regarding the nature, distribution, strength,
and erodibility of the soil to be placed on the site.
         C.   Conclusions and recommendations for grading procedures.
         D.   Conclusions and recommended designs for interim soil
stabilization devices and measures, and for permanent soil stabilization after

         F.   Opinions and recommendations covering the stability of the site.
            (Ord. 2016-25.  Passed 12-12-16.)
1116.09   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls.  The
SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). 
   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment
pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction.  Perimeter controls must be installed two working
days prior to commencement of construction.  The approved plan must be
implemented until the site reaches final stabilization.  All properties
adjacent to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil
erosion and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands.
   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of contractor
(s) responsible for implementation the SWP3 and providing that information to
City Engineer or administrator of code. The SWP3 shall identify all
subcontractors engaged in activities that could impact stormwater runoff.  The
SWP3 shall contain signatures from all of the identified subcontractors
indicating that they have been informed and understand their roles and
responsibilities in complying with the SWP3.  The applicant shall review the
SWP3 with the primary contractor prior to commencement of construction
activities and keep a SWP3 training log to demonstrate that this review had
occurred.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities.  The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable.  Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a 50-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the state, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible (e.g., stream
crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation
and restoration).  Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment
removal and maximize stormwater infiltration. 
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils.  The amount of soil
exposed during construction activity shall be minimized.  A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3.  The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year.  Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover. 
      Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization.  Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization
 
Area requiring permanent stabilization Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any area that will lie dormant for one Within 7 days of the most recent

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed.
 
   
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels.  Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices.  The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion.  Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices.  These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive
flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices.  The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site.  Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days.  Such practices
may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain
inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to
a sediment settling pond.  The design, installation and maintenance of erosion
and sediment controls shall address factors such as the amount, frequency,
intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater
runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes
expected to be present on the site.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.  Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are
not considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment settling pond.
Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing.  Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing.  They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized.  As construction progresses and the
topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the City Engineer and/or the Lake
SWCD, is required for any one of the following conditions:
         A.   Concentrated stormwater runoff.
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas which exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3)  inlet protection, or other sediment barriers;
         C.   Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land.
Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a sediment trap or
sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater and Land
Development.  The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a sediment
trap shall be limited to less than 5 acres.  Contributing drainage areas of 5
acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin.  An equivalent best
management practice may be utilized upon approval from the City of Wickliffe. 
The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone.  The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 1,800
cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area.  The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum 48-
hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always withdraw runoff
from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle.  As such, a skimmer
discharge device consistent with Rainwater and Land Development shall be
provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide both a
sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure shall be
constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest edition
of Rainwater and Land Development.
When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used as
temporary sediment trapping BMPs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase and
until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the City of Wickliffe.
The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of sediment
basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the pond
provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering zone.  As
such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be no
discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage zone
and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only occur
through the skimmer.
The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods: 
Method 1:  The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000ft3 per
disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
Method 2:  The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with RUSLE or other generally
accepted erosion prediction model.
When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone
must be less than or equal to five (5) feet.  The configuration between the
inlets and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at least two
units of length for each one unit of width  2:1 length-to-width ratio; however,
a length to width ratio of  4:1 is recommended.  Sediment must be removed from
the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity of the sediment storage
zone has been completely filled by sediment accumulations.  This limit is
typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin depth.  When
designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider public safety,
especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the sediment basin
and alternative sediment controls must be used where site limitations would
preclude a safe design.  The use of a combination of sediment and erosion
control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions.  Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties
and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow.  Where intended
to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and
shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff.  The relationship between the
maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in
Table 3 below.  Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the
size of the permissible drainage area.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 2% but < 20%
0.125                                20% but < 50%
 
      (4)    Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the City of Wickliffe, but their use shall not exceed the
limitations indicated in Table 3 above.  Detail drawings and plan notes shall
specify the diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative
perimeter controls if used instead of silt fence.
      (5)   Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes.  Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to 10 acres.
      (6)    Inlet protection.  Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems.  All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond.  Straw or hay
bales and filter socks around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet
protection.
      (7)    Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control.  Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled.  These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area.  These
entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances shall
be kept free of sediment tracked off site.  Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall
be cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site.  If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
Based on site conditions, City Engineer and/or the Lake SWCD may require
additional best management practices to control off site tracking and dust. 
These additional BMPs may include:
         C.   Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
         D.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas.  Wash water from
these areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-
settling pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1116.09 (g) of this regulation.  No surfactants or detergents may be used to
wash vehicles.
         E.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions.  The City Engineer and/or the Lake SWCD
may require dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed
areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and
regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (8)   Surface Waters of the State protection.  Construction vehicles
shall avoid water resources.  A 50 foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be
provided around surface waters of the state unless infeasible.  If it is
infeasible to provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the
SWP3 shall comply with the stabilization requirements in
1116.09.B.1 for areas within 50 feet of a surface water or riparian or wetland
setbacks if applicable, whichever is greater; and minimize soil compaction and,
unless infeasible, preserve topsoil.  If the applicant is permitted to disturb
areas within 50 feet of a water resource, the following conditions shall be
addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in water resources
or wetlands.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
         G.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands.  The flow
should be released such that no erosion occurs downslope.  Level spreaders may
need to be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
         H.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measures before the runoff enters the wetlands. The flow
should be released such that no erosion occurs downslope.  Level spreaders may
need to be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
      (9)   Modifying controls.  If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions. 
   (f)   Non-sediment Pollutant Controls:  No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in stormwater runoff.  The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources, wetlands or
the MS4.  These practices shall include but are not limited to the following: 
      A.   Waste Materials: A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      B.   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or water of the
state is prohibited.  A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available. 
      C.   Disposal of Other Wastewaters:  The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the state is prohibited.  The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
      D.   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area.  A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest
containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up
spills.  The ESC Plan shall contain spill prevention and response procedures
and these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction meeting. 
      E.   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.  The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      F.   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff:  Discovery of previously
unknown contaminated soils onsite shall be self-reported to Ohio EPA and local
authorities.  Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of
properly.  Runoff from contaminated soils shall not be discharged from the
site.  Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid waste
landfill sites or redevelopment sites.  Where construction activities are to
occur on sites with contamination from previous activities, operators shall be
aware that concentrations of materials that meet other criteria (i.e. not
considered a Hazardous Waste, meeting Voluntary Action Program (VAP standards))
may still result in stormwater discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality
Standards.  Such discharges are not authorized by this code. Control measures
which may be utilized to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to:
 
         i.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated runoff
and prevent discharge.
         ii.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer with
the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
         iii.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or other
such methods to prevent storm water from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building materials,
building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Applicants may
also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, Safety Response Plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site. 
      G.   COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS.  The SWP3 shall be consistent
with applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic
system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open
burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils
located within the development area.
      H.   TRENCH AND GROUND WATER CONTROL. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities.  If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through
a sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site.  Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice.  Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge. 
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
      I.   INTERNAL INSPECTIONS.  All controls on the site shall be inspected
at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm
event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection
frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is
temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g.,
site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of
inspection requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions
are expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been
attained from the City Engineer and/or the Lake SWCD and all of the following
conditions are met:
         i.   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
         ii.   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
         iii.   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
For sites that will not be completed by October 1, a Pre-Winter Stabilization
Meeting shall be held by the landowner and the developer, engineer and
contractor of the project and the City of Wickliffe prior to October 1, in
order to plan and approve winter erosion and sediment controls as defined in
the most current online edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required.  Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls.  Certified inspection reports shall be submitted to the City Engineer
within seven (7) working days from the inspection and retained at the
development site.
  These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
         (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system. 
         (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3
shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly.  The applicant
shall utilize an inspection form provided by the City of Wickliffe or an
alternate form acceptable to the City Engineer.  The inspection form shall
include:
            A.   The inspection date.
            B.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
            C.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred. 
            D.   Weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of inspection.
            E.   Locations of:
               1.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
               2.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
               3.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location.
               4.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
            F.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to
the SWP3 and implementation dates.
         (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands. 
         (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
         (5)   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
     (g)   Maintenance.  The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements.  All BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. 
All sediment control practices must be maintained in a functional condition
until all up slope areas they control reach final stabilization.  The applicant
shall provide a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the
continued performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party
and adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the City
Engineer.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When BMPs require repair or maintenance.  If an internal inspection
reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of a
sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three (3) days
of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within ten (10) days of the inspection as determined by the City
Engineer or site inspector.
      (3)   When BMPs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in accordance with the
schedule, the control practice must be implemented within ten (10) days from
the date of the inspection.  If the internal inspection reveals that the
planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (h)    Final Stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
City Engineer.  Once a definable area has achieved final stabilization, the
applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further inspection requirement
applies to that portion of the site.  (Ord. 2016-25.  Passed 12-12-16.)

within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period.  Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance.  If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         B.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If the
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.   When BMPs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed.  If
the internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection.  If the inspection reveals that
the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement
of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.

1117.01  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Wickliffe:
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the City of Wickliffe to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
SCMs are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation. 
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the City of Wickliffe's
future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
1117.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Lake County, and the
City of Wickliffe shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for
projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the City Engineer.  Such projects must be designed to minimize
the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of Chapter
1116 Erosion and Sediment Control.  (Ord. 2016-26.  Passed 12-12-16.)

1117.09   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General:  The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources. 
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site. 
Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a  watercourse restoration project and complies with the community's
riparian setback requirements, if applicable.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional criteria
required by the City Engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use:  SCMs shall be designed to
achieve the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be
compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine
maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots:  Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter 1363, shall provide stormwater management
and water quality controls for the development of all subdivided lots. This
shall include provisions for lot grading and drainage that prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent
practicable, the pre-development runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks from each
lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources:  SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
1117.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1116 and the City's riparian setback requirements, all as determined by the
City Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels:  All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm.  When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption:  The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1117.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCMs, or if
the stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by practices
defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the City
Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance:  All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the City Engineer as
detailed in Section
1117.08.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the City of Wickliffe, SCMs
serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and
maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property
owners, by the City of Wickliffe.  SCMs serving single lots shall be placed on
these lots, protected within an easement, and maintained by the property
owner. 
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage:  Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and
grubbing practices; and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and
through these areas. Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide
perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected and
ecological functions are maintained.
      (10)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology:  Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters the wetlands in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora.  The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope.  Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology. 
If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a hydrological
analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed discharge matches
the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics that support the wetland.
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection:  The City Engineer may allow modification
to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only if the
applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio
EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local
agencies as required in Section
1117.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1116 as determined by the City Engineer.  At a minimum, stream relocation
designs must show how the project will minimize changes to the vertical
stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream and
downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges:  Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm.  Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that off-site
runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a manner
that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow:  The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible.  The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas.  In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the City Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels:  Unless otherwise allowed by the City Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with vegetated
banks and designed to carry the 10 year, 24 hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas. 
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under City of Wickliffe zoning or where the use of an open drainage
system affects public health or safety, all as determined by the City
Engineer.  The following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems
when necessary: 
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5 year, 24 hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10 year, 24 hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development. 
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the City of Wickliffe:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25 year, 24 hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development. 
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams.  The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed.  The conduit or
conveyance must to be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
   F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration for the
tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource.  The tailwater elevation
used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100 year,
24 hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding:  Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100 year, 24 hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures.  When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City of Wickliffe
must be compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume.  First
consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be
given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new
floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also
be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for
floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing
watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the City of Wickliffe, reductions in
volume due to floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of
the development.  Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must
reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The
use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation:  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected. 
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control: 
      (1)   Direct runoff to an SCM:  The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more of the following SCMs.  These practices are listed in
Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general
performance standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The City Engineer may require a soil engineering report to be
prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed infiltration facilities
meet these performance standards.
For sites less than five (5) acres, but required to create a comprehensive
stormwater management plan, the City Engineer may approve other SCMs if the
applicant demonstrates to the City Engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs meet
the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
1117.09(c)(5). 
         C.   For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the City Engineer may approve other SCMs if the
applicant demonstrates to the City Engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs meet
the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
1117.09(c)(5), and has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         D.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the City Engineer may approve SCMs not included in Table 2 of this
regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the Ohio
Department of Transportation "Location and Design Manual, Volume Two Drainage
Design". 
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs.  SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1). 
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the City Engineer
that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs controlling the
amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-term hourly
records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
                  WQv = C*P*A/12   
               where terms have the following meanings:
                  WQv   = water quality volume in acre-feet
                  C    = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms
                                  less than 1 in.
                  P   = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
                  A   = area draining into the stormwater
                                  practice, in acres.
Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA) for use in determining the WQv can be determined using the list in Table 1
or using the following equation to calculate the runoff coefficient.
               C=0.858i3 - 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:   
               i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
                                Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type
of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average.  For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
 
 
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the stormwater practice for sediment storage.  This volume
shall be incorporated into the sections of stormwater practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   Each individual SCM must be sized to treat the WQv associated
with its entire contributing drainage area.  Exceptions to this may be granted
by the City Engineer and/or the OEPA on a case-by-case basis.
         D.   Stormwater quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
         E.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site. 
Table 2:  Draw Down Times for Stormwater Control Measures

  Sand and other Media Filtration5             24 hours
  Pocket Wetland7                              24 hours
1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended detention
basins.  Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv. 
3Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQV .
4 Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water.  Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv in
a pool and 75% in marshes.  The above the permanent pool must be equal to the
WQv.
 
 
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
in Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site.  No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time.  The
outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and
promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation. 
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the
vegetation.  The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). 
The aquatic bench shall be planted with native plant species comparable to
wetland vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged inundation. The use of
invasive plant species is prohibited.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets.  The forebay and micropool volume shall
be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
            4.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance. 
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
      (5)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs: 
The applicant may request approval from the City Engineer for the use of
alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant shows to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer that these SCMs are equivalent in pollutant
removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those listed in Table
2.  If the site is greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5) acres but
part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five (5)
or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is necessary.  To demonstrate
the equivalency, the applicant must show: 
         A.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State.  The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a (TMDL) has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions.  The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the City Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet)
of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development drainage
area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the following
standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Model pervious, directly connected impervious and disconnected
impervious areas as separate subwatersheds.
            4.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            5.   Rainfall Depth - For the most accurate, up-to-date, location-
specific rainfall data for stormwater design, use the Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States, NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). [available online:  http:/
/hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.]
            6.   Temporal Distribution - Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than 1
year.  Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            7.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use. 
               a.   Pre-development Curve Numbers - For wooded or brushy areas,
use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values. For all
other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture, grassland, or
range in good hydrologic condition.
               b.   Post-development Curve Numbers - Open space areas shall use
post-construction HSGs from Rainwater and Land Development unless the soil is
amended after development according to the following protocol: till the subsoil
to 15-18 inches, then till using a chisel, spader, or rotary tillage and
incorporate compost through top 12 inches, replace topsoil to a minimum depth
of 4 inches.  All undisturbed areas or open space with amended soils shall be
treated as "open space in good condition."
            8.   Time of Concentration - Use velocity based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
               a.   Maximum sheet flow length is 100 ft.
               b.   Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for shallow
concentrated flow from NEH-4 (Spell this out).
            9.   The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume.  Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in Rainwater and Land Development or a hydrologic model
acceptable to the City Engineer.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems.  From
the volume determined in Section
1117.09(d)(3)A., determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
 
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff is: The Critical Storm
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:              will be:

---                       10                          1 year
10                        20                          2 year
20                        50                          5 year
50                        100                         10 year
100                       250                         25 year
250                       500                         50 year
500                       ---                         100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm.  The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area.  The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
 
   (e)   Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects.
      (1)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment
projects shall reduce existing site impervious areas by at least 20 percent.  A
one-for-one credit towards the 20 percent net reduction of impervious area can
be obtained through the use green roofs. Where site conditions prevent the
reduction of impervious area, SCMs shall be implemented to treat at least 20
percent of the WQv. 
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and stormwater
quality control facilities are used, ensure a 20 percent net reduction of the
site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv,
or a combination of the two.
      (3)   Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume required to be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at 20 percent. 
      (4)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section
1117.10 may be approved by the City Engineer.  (Ord. 2016-26.  Passed 12-12-
16.)
1117.10  ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the City of Wickliffe determines that site constraints compromise
the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in
an improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 12 watershed
unit as the proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the
water quality volume at the point of retrofit, whichever is greater. 
      (4)   An inspection and maintenance agreement as described in Chapter
1117.08(d)(10) is established to ensure operations and treatment in perpetuity.
      (5)   Obtain prior written approval from Ohio EPA.
   (b)   Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the
following.  All alternative actions shall be approved by the City Engineer:
      (1)   Fees, in an amount specified by the City of Wickliffe to be applied
to community-wide SCMs.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site SCMs and/or the retrofit of an existing
practice to increase quality and quantity control.
      (3)   Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
      (4)   Acquisition or conservation easements on protected open space
significantly contributing to stormwater control such as wetland complexes. 
(Ord. 2016-26.  Passed 12-12-16.)
1117.11   EASEMENTS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the City Engineer for inspections and
maintenance shall be secured by easements.  The following conditions shall
apply to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan. 
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the City of Wickliffe prior to approval
of a final plat and shall be recorded with the Lake Auditor and on all property
deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the City Engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than 25-feet wide.
The easement shall also incorporate the entire practice plus an additional 25-
foot wide band around the perimeter of the SCM.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site. 
   (e)   Easements to structural SCMs shall be restricted against the
construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may
obstruct the free flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and
maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final grade from that
described by the final grading plan approved by the City of Wickliffe.  Any re-
grading and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be removed
by the City of Wickliffe at the property owners' expense.
      (Ord. 2016-26.  Passed 12-12-16.)
1117.12   MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the applicant and provided to the
City Engineer:
   (a)   Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent SCMs must be
installed and made functional, as determined by the City Engineer and per the
approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   An As-Built Certification, including As-Built Survey and Inspection,
must be sealed, signed and dated by a Professional Engineer and a Professional
Surveyor with a statement certifying that the stormwater control measures, as
designed and installed, meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Stormwater
Management Plan approved by the City Engineer.  In evaluating this
certification, the City Engineer may require the submission of a new set of
stormwater practice calculations if he/she determines that the design was
altered significantly from the approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan.  The As-Built Survey must provide the location, dimensions, and bearing
of such practices and include the entity responsible for long-term maintenance
as detailed in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement.
   (c)   A copy of the complete and recorded Inspection and Maintenance Plan
and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement as specified in Section
1117.08 must be provided to the City Engineer.
      (Ord. 2016-26.  Passed 12-12-16.)
1117.13    ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   The owner shall inspect SCMs regularly as described in the Inspection and
Maintenance Plan and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement. The City of
Wickliffe has the authority to enter upon the property to conduct inspections
as necessary, with prior notification of the property owner, to verify that the
SCMs are being maintained and operated in accordance with this regulation. Upon
finding a malfunction or other need for maintenance or repair, the City of
Wickliffe shall provide written notification to the responsible party, as
detailed in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement, of the need for
maintenance.  Upon notification, the responsible party shall have five (5)
working days, or other mutually agreed upon time, to makes repairs or submit a
plan with detailed action items and established timelines.  Should repairs not
be made within this time, or a plan approved by the City Engineer for these
repairs not in place, the City of Wickliffe may undertake the necessary repairs
and assess the responsible party.  (Ord. 2016- 26.  Passed 12-12-16.)
1117.14  FEES.
   The Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan review, filing, and inspection
fee is part of a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to the City
of Wickliffe before the review process begins.  The City Engineer shall
establish a fee schedule based upon the actual estimated cost for providing
these services.
(Ord. 2016-26.  Passed 12-12-16.)
1117.15   BOND.
   (a)   If a Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond
of 5% of the total project cost has been deposited with the City of Wickliffe
Finance Department.  This bond shall be posted for the City of Wickliffe to
perform the obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner of the
development area as stated in this regulation and to allow all work to be
performed as needed in the event that the applicant fails to comply with the
provisions of this regulation.  The stormwater bond will be returned, less City
of Wickliffe administrative fees as detailed in Chapter
1117 of the City of Wickliffe Codified Ordinances, when the following three
criteria are met:
      (1)   After 80% of the lots of the project have been complete or 100% of
the total project has been permanently stabilized or three (3) years from the
time of permanent stabilization have passed.
      (2)   An As-Built Inspection of all stormwater control measures as
described in
1117.12 is approved by the City Engineer.
      (3)   An Inspection and Maintenance Plan has been approved by the City of
Wickliffe and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement has been signed by the
developer, the contractor, the City of Wickliffe, and the private owner or
homeowners association who will take long term responsibility for these SCMs,
is accepted by the City Engineer.
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project.  If all of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
the City of Wickliffe may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding issues
with all stormwater management structures on the site and the remainder of the
bond shall be given to the private lot owner/ homeowners association for the
purpose of long term maintenance of the project.
(Ord. 2016-26.  Passed 12-12-16.)
1117.16  INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY STORMWATER CONTROL  MEASURES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the City Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the final
grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the site is
subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods.  The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the City Engineer to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized.  Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service.    Upon completion of installation of these practices, all disturbed
areas and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these practices must
be stabilized within 2 days.

(Ord. 2008-43.  Passed 6-9-08.)
   1118.07  DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illicit Discharges.  No person shall discharge, or
cause to be discharged, an illicit discharge into the MS4. The commencement,
conduct, or continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is prohibited
except as described below:
      (1)   Water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration; uncontaminated
pumped ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains;
air conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from fire fighting activities. These
discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the City of
Wickliffe to be significant contributors of pollutants to the MS4.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the City of Wickliffe as being
necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Discharges from off-lot discharging home sewage treatment systems
permitted by the Lake County Board of Health for the purpose of discharging
treated sewage effluent in accordance with Ohio Administrative Code 3701-29, or
other applicable Lake Board of Health regulations, until such time as the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency issues an NPDES permitting mechanism for
residential 1, 2, or 3 family dwellings. These discharges are exempt unless
such discharges are deemed to be creating a public health nuisance by the Lake
County Board of Health.
In compliance with the City of Wickliffe Storm Water Management Program,
discharges from all off-lot discharging home sewage treatment systems must
either be eliminated or have coverage under an appropriate NPDES permit issued
and approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. When such permit
coverage is available, discharges from off-lot discharging home sewage
treatment systems will no longer be exempt from the requirements of this
regulation. 
   (b)   Prohibition of Illegal Connections. The construction, use,
maintenance, or continued existence of illegal connections to the MS4 is
prohibited.
      (1)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (2)   A person is considered to be in violation of this regulation if the
person connects a line conveying illicit discharges to the MS4, or allows such
a connection to continue.
         (Ord. 2008-43.  Passed 6-9-08.)
   1118.08  MONITORING OF ILLICIT DISCHARGES AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   Establishment of an Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection
Monitoring Program. The City of Wickliffe shall establish a program to detect
and eliminate illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4. This
program shall include the mapping of the MS4, including MS4 outfalls and home
sewage treatment systems; the routine inspection of storm water outfalls to the
MS4, and the systematic investigation of potential residential, commercial,
industrial, and institutional facilities for the sources of any dry weather
flows found as the result of these inspections.
   (b)   Inspection of Residential, Commercial, Industrial, or Institutional
Facilities.
      (1)   The City of Wickliffe shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to this regulation as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this regulation.

and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge, as determined by the
City of Wickliffe.
      (3)   The City of Wickliffe shall have the right to require the facility
owner/operator to install monitoring equipment as necessary. This sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in safe and proper
operating condition by the facility owner/operator at the owner/operator’s
expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be
calibrated by the City of Wickliffe to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and reasonable
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the facility’s owner/operator at the written or oral request of the City of
Wickliffe and shall not be replaced.  The costs of clearing such access shall
be borne by the facility owner/operator.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the City of Wickliffe access to a
facility subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit discharge
inspection is a violation of this regulation.
      (6)   If the City of Wickliffe is refused access to any part of the
facility from which storm water is discharged, and the City of Wickliffe
demonstrates probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
regulation, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of an
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
regulation or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, the City of Wickliffe may seek issuance of a search
warrant, civil remedies including but not limited to injunctive relief, and/or
criminal remedies from any court of appropriate jurisdiction.
      (7)   Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility owner/operator.
         (Ord. 2008-43.  Passed 6-9-08.)
   1118.09  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Notice of Violation. When the City of Wickliffe finds that a person
has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this regulation,
the City of Wickliffe may order compliance by written Notice of Violation. Such
notice must specify the violation and shall be hand delivered, and/or sent by
registered mail, to the owner/operator of the facility.  Such notice may
require the following actions:

      (2)   The elimination of illicit discharges or illegal connections;
      (3)   That violating discharges, practices, or operations cease and
desist;
      (4)   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; or
      (5)   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   (b)   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the Notice of Violation shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said Notice shall further advise
that, should the facility owner/operator fail to remediate or restore within
the established deadline, a legal action for enforcement may be initiated.
   (c)   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation must meet compliance
standards within the time established in the Notice of Violation.
   (d)   Administrative Hearing:  If the violation has not been corrected
pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Notice of Violation, the City of
Wickliffe shall schedule an administrative hearing to determine reasons for
non-compliance and to determine the next enforcement activity. Notice of the
administrative hearing shall be hand delivered and/or sent registered mail.
   (e)   Injunctive Relief:  It shall be unlawful for any owner/operator to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
regulation pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3709.211.  If an owner/operator has violated
or continues to violate the provisions of this regulation, the City of
Wickliffe may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining
the owner/operator from activities that would create further violations or
compelling the owner/operator to perform abatement or remediation of the
violation.

the site, building and surroundings; assuring that signs are located and
designed to maintain a safe and orderly pedestrian and vehicular environment;
assuring that signs are consistent with the community's development objectives,
thereby maintaining the community's development objectives, and providing a
mechanism for the eventual removal of signs not complying with this chapter.
(Ord. 2019-03.  Passed 1-14-19.)
   1161.03  DEFINITIONS; DETERMINING MAXIMUM AREA.
   (a)    Definitions.
      (1)   General sign definitions.
         A.    "Sign" means any structure, or part thereof, any device attached
to a structure, or painted or represented directly or indirectly thereon; or
any other device which is intended to announce, direct, advertise or draw
attention to. A sign may include banners, lights and other site or building
features, and may be represented by words or letters, figures, symbols or
characterizations, or other insignia or devices. Architectural features, either
as part of the building or freestanding, are not considered signs and are thus
exempt from these regulations. An architectural feature is any construction
attending but not an integral part of the sign, and which consists of landscape
or building or structural forms complementing the site in general.
         B.    "Accessory sign" means a sign which directs attention to a
business, use, service, activity, commodity or profession conducted, sold or
offered upon the same lot where such sign is located.
         C.    "Billboard" means a sign which-directs attention to a business,
use, service, activity, commodity or profession which is not conducted, sold or
offered upon the same lot where such sign is located.
         D.    "Sign area or dimension".
            l.    For a sign which is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise
prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area or
dimensions includes the entire portion within such background or frame.
            2.    For a sign which is comprised of individual letters, figures
or elements on a wall or similar surface of the building or structure, or an
irregular shaped freestanding sign, the area of the sign shall encompass a
regular, or a combination of regular geometric shapes which form or approximate
the perimeter of all the elements in the display. When separate elements are
organized to form a single sign, but the elements are separated by open space,
the area shall be calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination
of forms, which comprise all the display area, including the space between the
elements.
            3.    For any sign, the area includes the frame but not the pole or
other structural support unless such pole or structural support is illuminated
or otherwise so designated to constitute a display device.
            4.    When a pole or ground sign has more than two faces, the
maximum area shall be calculated as having three faces. The area shall be
determined by calculating the area of a single geometric plan which encompasses
the figures or object and multiplying such area by three.
            5.    Final determination of the sign area and sign dimension shall
be the responsibility of the Building Commissioner.
         E.    "Sign height" shall be measured from the base of the sign, if a
freestanding sign, from its point of attachment to the ground to the top-most
element. A wall sign, or projecting sign, or a freestanding sign on a man-made

      (1)    General guidelines. In addition to assuring compliance with the
numerical standards pursuant to Sections
1161.04,
1161.05 and
1161.06, the Building Commissioner shall also, in reviewing all signs, consider
the proposed general design, arrangement, texture, material, colors, lighting,
placement and the appropriateness of the proposed sign in relationship to the
other signs and the other structures both on the premises and in the
surrounding areas, and only approve signs which are consistent with the intent,
purposes, standards and criteria of the sign regulations.
      (2)    Specific standards for determining the appropriateness of the
sign:

elements.
         H.    The sign should have an appropriate contrast and be designed
with a limited number of, and with the harmonious use of, colors.
         I.    Extraneous elements, by virtue of inappropriate remodeling, and
which exist at the time a new sign is proposed shall be removed to improve the
clarity and design of the proposed sign and restore the intended character of
the building.
         J.   Signs, if seen in series, shall have a continuity of design with
the style of sign generally consistent throughout the building or block.
         K.    Instructional signs shall contain the minimum information and
the minimum area necessary to convey the message and instruct the viewer in the
safe and efficient use of the facility.
         L.    Visible frames or supports for projecting signs shall be

         B.    Be so located, arranged or shielded as to be directed and
reflected away from adjacent property or streets.
      (2)    Signs shall not be lighted to obstruct traffic control or other
public information signs. Signs visible from sight lines along streets shall
not contain symbols or words such as "stop", "slow", etc., or red and green
lights that resemble highway traffic signs or devices. These regulations shall
not apply to Christmas display lighting.
      (3)    Except for permitted time, temperature and message signs,
flashing, moving or intermittent illumination and "outline lighting" shall not
be permitted by right. The Planning Commission may, however, make a finding and
permit such lighting as a conditional use. If such permit is granted, the
maximum area of signs shall be reduced by one-half.
   (c)    Construction Standards.
      (1)    Signs shall be structurally sound and located so as to pose no
threat to pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
         A.    Signs shall be fabricated on and of materials which are of good
quality, good durability and are complimentary to the building of which they
become a part.
         B.    The construction, erection, safety and maintenance of signs
shall comply with the Ohio Basic Building Code and the Ohio Revised Code.
         C.    Signs shall be structurally designed to withstand wind pressure
of thirty pounds per square foot in any direction.

a firm or person responsible for erecting the sign, to be placed on the frame
or other supports and large enough to be read by a person standing on the
ground, sidewalk or parking lot nearest the sign.
      (3)    If the sign is deemed by the Building Commissioner to be in an
unsafe condition, the owner of the business shall be immediately notified, in
writing, and shall, within forty-eight hours of such notification, correct such
unsafe condition or remove the sign. If the correction has not been made within
forty-eight hours, the Building Commissioner may remove or cause such unsafe
sign to be removed, repaired or maintained at the expense of the property owner
or lessee, sign owner or sign lessee.
      (4)    Whenever any sign, either conforming or nonconforming to these
regulations, is required to be removed for the purpose of repair, re-lettering
or repainting, the same may be done without a permit or any payment of fees
provided that all of the following conditions are met:
         A.    There is no alteration or remodeling to the structure or the
mounting of the sign itself;
         B.    There is no enlargement or increase in any of the dimensions of

   1162.01  NOTICE TO CORRECT.
   Whenever the Building Commissioner finds that any building or structure or
part thereof in the City is in such an unsafe condition as to endanger life, by
reason of deterioration of materials or lack of repair or maintenance, or is or
will become a hazard to the health, safety or welfare of its occupants or the
public, or is or will become a blighting or deteriorating factor in any zoning
district in the City of Wickliffe, or will impair or adversely affect the value
of neighboring and/or contiguous property, the Building Commissioner shall
report such facts to Council, which may, thereupon, declare such building or
structure to be a nuisance.  The Building Commissioner shall have authority and
it shall be his or her duty to forthwith notify in writing the owner, agent, or
person in possession, charge or control of such building or structure or part
thereof, to adopt and put into effect such precautionary measures as may be
necessary or advisable in order to place such building or structure or part
thereof in a safe condition or proper repair or maintenance.  Such notice shall
state briefly the nature of the work required to be done and shall specify the
time within which the work required to be done shall be completed by the person
notified, which time shall be fixed by the Building Commissioner upon taking
into consideration the condition of such building or structure or part thereof
and the danger to life or property, which may result from its unsafe condition
or lack of repair or maintenance. 
(Ord. 2007-25.  Passed 4-9-07.)
   1162.02  SERVICE OF NOTICE; PLACARDING PREMISES.
   Whenever the Building Commissioner is unable to find the owner of a
building, structure or part thereof, or any agent or person in possession,
charge or control thereof, upon whom notice may be served, the Building
Commissioner shall address, stamp and mail such notice to such person at his or
her last known address, and in addition thereto, shall place or cause to be
placed the notice herein provided for upon such building at or near its
principal entrance and shall also post or cause to be posted in a conspicuous
place at each entrance to such building, in large letters, a notice as follows:
THIS BUILDING IS IN A DANGEROUS CONDITION AND
HAS BEEN CONDEMNED BY THE BUILDING COMMISSIONER.
(Ord. 2007-25.  Passed 4-9-07.)
   1162.03  REMOVAL OF PLACARDS.
   No person shall remove the notice provided for in Section
1162.02 without written permission from the Building Commissioner.
(Ord. 2007-25.  Passed 4-9-07.)
   1162.04  NONCOMPLIANCE; HEARING AND APPEAL.
   If the owner, agent or person in possession, charge or control of such
building or structure or part thereof, when so notified, fails, neglects or
refuses to place such building or structure or part thereof in a safe
condition, repair or maintenance, and fails to adopt such precautionary
measures as have been specified by the Building Commissioner, within the time
specified in the notice provided for in Section
1162.01, then at the expiration of such time, the Building Commissioner shall
set a time and place for a hearing to be held on the question of such
noncompliance.  The date shall be not later than ten days following the
expiration of the time within which the work was to have been completed, or the
next meeting of the Board of Zoning Appeals, whichever is later.  The Building
Commissioner shall notify, in writing, the owner, agent or person in
possession, charge or control of the building or structure or part thereof in
question of his or her obligation to appear before such Board of Zoning Appeals
at the place and time set by the Building Commissioner and to show cause why
all persons should not be prevented from entering the building, structure or
part thereof in question, except persons entering for the purpose of making
repairs, and also to show cause why such building, structure or part thereof
should not be torn down and destroyed.  Judgment shall be rendered by the Board
of Zoning Appeals on the basis of a majority vote.  The decision of the Board
of Zoning Appeals shall be final.  Failure of the owner, agent  or person in
possession, charge or control of the building, structure or part thereof, to
appear at such hearing at the time and place specified shall result in a
violation to be charged against him or her by default.
(Ord. 2007-25.  Passed 4-9-07.)
   1162.05  EFFECTIVE BOARDING PENDING REHABILITATION.
   (a)   Pending the correction of violations of these Codified Ordinances,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Ohio Revised Code, or the Ohio Basic
Building Code, the owner of a structure may secure the structure through
effective boarding.
   (b)   To effectively board the structure, the owner shall apply, within
seven days of receiving a notice of violation, to the Building Department for a
permit to determine if it can be effectively boarded, and grant or deny the
owner a permit to board, setting forth special requirements, if any, necessary
for compliance with minimum standards for effective boarding.
   (c)   The owner shall effectively board the structure within seven days of
the issuance of a boarding permit, or within such other time limit that the
Building Commissioner deems appropriate.
   (d)   Effective boarding shall include, but not be limited to, doors,
windows or other areas open to ingress and egress and to weather elements. 
Such opening shall be secured by plywood at least one-half inch thick and cut
and fit into the openings.  Openings in excess of 48 inches wide shall be
framed with two-inch by four-inch lumber frame.  All exterior boarding shall be
painted to correspond to the color of the dwelling.
   (e)   Upon effectively boarding the structure, the owner shall monitor and
maintain the structure and its surrounding premises in a safe, secured and
sanitary condition.  Any portion of the exterior structure that is deemed to be
potentially hazardous shall be removed or treated in such a manner so as to
eliminate the hazard.  Failure of the owner to properly maintain the building
in the above condition will result in the structure being deemed a public
nuisance and scheduled for demolition.
   (f)   Structures that are boarded without first obtaining a boarding permit
shall continue to be considered public nuisances subject to demolition.
   (g)   Within thirty days of the issuance of a permit to board, the owner
shall apply for a building permit.  Failure of the owner to obtain a building
permit subsequent to effective boarding will result in the structure being
deemed a public nuisance and scheduled for demolition.
   (h)   Rehabilitation of an effectively boarded structure shall commence
within thirty days of receiving  a building permit.  If rehabilitation does not
commence within this time period, or if the building permit is otherwise
invalidated or revoked, then the Building Commissioner may declare that the
nuisance has not been abated and may schedule the structure for demolition.
   (i)   If the owner, agent or person in control fails, neglects or refuses to
comply with this section, the Building Commissioner may take appropriate action
to demolish and remove an unsafe structure, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261, or
may advise the Director of Law of the facts in the case, who, in turn, may
institute appropriate action in court to cause correction of the violations and
defects or effective boarding of such structure pending rehabilitation.
   (j)   The securing of building permits for such structure shall not in and
of itself bar the Building Commissioner from taking action to abate the
nuisance.
(Ord. 2007-25.  Passed 4-9-07.)
   1162.06  VIOLATIONS.
   No person shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter or fail to
comply with any notice of the Building Commissioner or decision of the Board of
Zoning Appeals made pursuant thereto.  A separate offense shall be deemed
committed for each day of failure to comply with the notice of the Building
Commissioner, beyond the time within which work is required to be done, and for
each day of failure to comply with the decision of the Board, in the case of an
appeal.
(Ord. 2007-25.  Passed 4-9-07.)
   1162.07  INTERPRETATION.
   In the event that any other provisions of the Codified Ordinances conflict
with any provision contained in this chapter, then the provisions contained in
this chapter shall govern.
(Ord. 2007-25.  Passed 4-9-07.)
   1162.99  PENALTY.
   Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be deemed, upon
conviction of the first offense, guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree
and shall be fined no more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) and/or
imprisoned not more than ninety days, or both.  Any person convicted of a
subsequent violation of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be deemed guilty
of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned not more than six months, or both. 
Such persons shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for each day, every
day or portions thereof, during which any violation of the provisions of this
chapter is committed, permitted or contained.

other person in charge of the building fails or neglects to comply with the
directive, he shall be in violation of this section. Each day that the person
fails to comply with the directive, shall constitute a separate offense.
   (b)    No person shall remove or deface any street name or house number put

place a lien on the property for the amount previously specified. The City will
use these funds to complete the plans submitted by the owner in the event that
the owner does not comply with the deadlines as previously submitted in the
owner's vacant building plan. Escrow funds will be released upon completion of
the work or transfer of ownership, provided that all fees have been paid in

registering and processing the vacant building owner registration form and for
the costs incurred by the City in monitoring the vacant building site. The
annually increased fee amounts shall be reasonably related to the costs
incurred by the City for demolition and hazard abatement of or repairs to
vacant buildings, as well as the continued normal administrative costs stated

Planning and Zoning Code and the City of Wickliffe Building Code, shall be
issued a Certificate of Occupancy by the Building Department.

Chapter.
      (3)    Change in use of nonconforming residential one-, two- or three-
family building or use. A Certificate of Occupancy shall be required when there

condition. If the City performs tests required under this section, there shall
be a minimum fee of three hundred dollars ($300.00) for the first two hours of
time spent on the performance of said tests. Any additional time spent shall be
charged to the applicant at a rate of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per hour or
portion thereof.
         The fee of three hundred dollars ($300.00) is required prior to the
scheduling of any required dye test. The property owner of record shall be
responsible for locating and raising of the inspection tees before any test is
done. Any sewer dye test performed by the City shall be valid for a period of

issued by the Building Commissioner or his/her designee for a period not
exceeding six (6) months, during which time alterations are being made or while
a dwelling or other building is being completed. Such temporary certificates
shall not be construed as altering the respective rights, duties or obligations
of the owners.

   1309.43  LOTS OF RECORD OF INSUFFICIENT AREA.
   A lot of record which does not comply with the area and/or width of lot
regulations of the district in which it is located on the effective date of
this Zoning Ordinance or any amendment thereto which shall make the lot
nonconforming, may be used as follows:
   (a)    If occupied by a dwelling, such dwelling may be maintained, repaired
or altered; provided, however, that the building may not be enlarged in floor
area unless the enlarged sections comply with all other regulations of this

   (b)    If vacant, the lot may be used, as a site for a one-family dwelling
only, provided that all other regulations of this Zoning Ordinance, except lot
area and lot width regulations, shall be complied with.
   (c)    If replatting of such adjoining nonconforming lots cannot be effected
reasonably without resulting in an average lot width less than the minimum
required for the district, such regulations may be modified by the Commission
to permit the district in which subdivision is located.

   Where a building line has not been established by map or ordinance, and
where fifty percent or more of the aggregate street frontage between two
successive intersections streets is occupied by buildings of the type and use
permitted in the district before the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance or
a relevant amendment thereto, the average setback of conforming buildings

the established building line, provided the average depth of the front yards
for the entire unit development is not less than the minimum depth established
for front yards for the district.
   (c)    Side Yards. If a planned utilization of side yards is attained, the
"service" side of two dwellings (kitchens, garages, utility rooms) may be

   1314.10  PURPOSE.
   In the enactment, execution and enforcement of this chapter, it is
recognized that there are certain uses which, due to the nature of their
operation, are recognized as having seriously objectionable operational
characteristics, particularly when several of such uses are concentrated in
close proximity to each other thereby having a detrimental effect upon the
surrounding area.  The purpose of these regulations is to promote the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Wickliffe and preserve
property values by minimizing and controlling the negative secondary effects of
adult entertainment businesses. It is not the purpose of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented entertainment protected
by the First Amendment, or to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of
adult entertainment to their intended market. Further, it is not the intent or
effect of this Chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution, or exhibition
of adult entertainment as defined herein.  (Ord. 2003-34.  Passed 6-23-03.)
   1314.20  FINDINGS.
   Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult
entertainment business on the community presented in open meetings before the
City of Wickliffe Planning Commission and City Council, and studies of the
Brookpark Road corridor conducted by the City of Brookpark, Ohio; findings
incorporated in the case of the City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475
U.S. 41 (1986); and on studies in other states including Indiana, Minnesota,
and New York; and “The Report to The American Center for Law and Justice on the
Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses,” it is found that adult
entertainment businesses, as defined herein, have a negative secondary impact
on the health, safety and welfare of the community.
   The regulation of these uses is necessary to insure that the detrimental
effects will not contribute to the blighting, downgrading or other diminution
of property values of the surrounding neighborhood. The primary purpose of
these regulations is to prevent a concentration of these uses in any one area.
Uses subject to these controls are:
   (a)    Adult book store;
   (b)    Adult motion picture theater;
   (c)    Adult peep show;
   (d)    Massage establishment; and

      (Ord. 1989-23. Passed 5-8-89.)
   1314.50  WAIVER PROVISIONS.
   Application to establish any of the above-regulated uses shall be forwarded
immediately by the Building Commissioner to the Planning Commission.
   (a)    The Planning Commission may waive the 1,000 feet separation

      (1)   That the proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest
or injurious to nearby properties, and that the spirit and intent of this
chapter will be observed.
      (2)   That the proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the development
of a "skid row" area.
      (3)   That the establishment of an additional regulated use in the area
will not be contrary to any program of neighborhood conservation and will not
interfere with any program of urban renewal.
   (b)    Prior to granting such regulated use, the Planning Commission shall
give due notice of receipt of any application under consideration (notice of
application) to all persons to whom any real property within 1,000 feet of the
premises in question shall be assessed, and to the occupants of all single; two

unit buildings over four (4) families (who shall be requested to post such
notice in an appropriate location within the multi-unit building) and to all
places within 1,000 feet, and to any neighborhood improvement in writing of
their existence. Such notice shall be delivered personally or by mail addressed
to the respective owners and if the tenant's name is not known, the term
"Occupant" may be used.
   (c)    The notice of application shall inform the recipient of the
applicant's name, the applicant's proposal, the local address and the lot
number and subdivision name of the premises in question, and the section of the
Zoning Ordinance under which the proposal is being processed. Such notice shall

writing, in person or via telephone with a time period expiring not less than
fourteen days from the mailing date of such notice.
   (d)    Subsequent to the deadline for response to the notice of application,
a decision shall be made by the Planning Commission, taking into consideration
the comments, statements and opinions expressed, to either approve, approve
with conditions or deny the proposal in accordance with the standards set forth
in this section. If no protests to the proposal were received by the Planning
Commission response to the notice of application having been mailed and if the
applicant accepts the decision of the Planning Commission this decision shall
be deemed final and shall take immediate effect. If, however, a protest was
received by the Planning Commission in response to the notice of application
having been mailed, this decision shall not take effect until the expiration of
the appeal period set forth below.
   (e)    A copy of the decision of the Planning Commission shall be mailed to
the applicant and to all persons responding to the notice of application. Any
person aggrieved by the decision by the Planning Commission may within fourteen
calendar days after the mailing of such decision, appeal same to the Board of
Zoning Appeals in accordance with the procedural regulations set forth in
Chapter
1335. If an appeal is filed by other than the applicant the Planning Commission

made and after receiving a report and recommendation from the Planning
Commission.
   (g)    In approving a permit for any regulated use the Planning Commission
or the Board of Zoning Appeals may impose any such conditions or limitations
upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance or operation of the
regulated use as may in its judgment be necessary for the protection of the
public interest. Any evidence and  guarantee may be required as proof that the
condition stipulated in connection wherewith will be fulfilled.
   (h)    When the decision of the Planning Commission becomes effective,
whether because no protests to the proposal were received by the Commission in
response to the notice of applications or because no appeal was taken to the
Board of Zoning Appeal within the allotted fourteen (14) calendar days, the
Commission shall immediately notify the Building Commissioner in writing
indicating the Commission's approval, approval with conditions, in which case
the conditions shall be set out in detail, or denial. If the decision of the
Commission approves or approves with conditions, the requested waiver, the
Building Commissioner shall, if all other applicable Building Code and Zoning
Ordinance regulations have been compiled with, issue an occupancy permit
subject to any conditions imposed by the Planning Commission.

   1321.10  INTENT.
   Off-street parking and loading requirements and regulations are established
in order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)    To relieve congestion on streets so that they can be utilized more
fully for  movement of traffic; and,
   (b)    To promote the safety and convenience of employees, guests and
shoppers by  locating parking areas so as to lessen car movements in areas of
congestion; and,
   (c)    To promote the general convenience, welfare and prosperity of
institutional, residential, retail business, recreational, commercial-
manufacturing and industrial developments, which depend upon off-street parking
and off-street loading facilities.
      (Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-29-61.)
   1321.20  DETERMINATION OF NEED FOR OFF-STREET PARKING.
   Accessory off-street parking facilities, including access driveways, shall
be determined in conformance with the Schedule of Section
1321.31 for the various institutional, residential, retail business,
recreational and industrial buildings and uses, and provided in conformance
with the other provisions of this chapter as a condition precedent to the
occupancy of such building or use. Facilities shall be provided for the entire
building or use:
   (a)    Whenever a building is constructed or a new use established;
   (b)    Whenever the use of an existing building is changed to a use
requiring more parking facilities;
   (c)    Whenever an existing building is altered and there is an increase in
the number of dwelling units, seating capacity or floor areas of the building.
      (Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-29-61.)
   
   1321.21  CONTINUATION OF PARKING FACILITIES.
   All off-street parking facilities, or those required as accessory to a use
of a proposed or altered building, shall continue unobstructed in operation,
shall not be used for automobile service or repair and shall not be reduced
below the required size as long as the main use remains, unless an equivalent
number of spaces is provided for such use in another approved location.
   In order to insure the continued use for automobile parking purposes of any
areas established in compliance with these regulations, the Commission may
require evidence in writing that the owner or owners of the land to be included
in such automobile parking areas have agreed by covenant to continue the use of
such land for off-street parking accessory to the residential, institutional,
business or industrial use for which such parking areas are required, and such
covenant shall be filed among the records of Lake County.
(Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-29-61.)
   1321.30  STANDARDS AND DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of determining accessory off-street parking requirements,
definitions and standards shall be as follows:
   (a)    "Accessory parking space" means an open or enclosed area accessible
from a street for parking of motor vehicles of owners, occupants, employees,
customers or tenants of the main building or use. Except for one and two-family
dwellings, each space shall be not less than nine feet wide and 180 square feet
in area exclusive of all drives, curbs and turning space. The number of spaces
shall be determined from an accurate plan of the area.
   (b)    "Gross floor area" means the area of all floors measured from the
exterior faces of the building.
   (c)    "Functional floor area" means the total area of all floors devoted to
owner or tenant occupancy less the building floor area devoted to non-public
uses such as storage rooms, mechanic rooms, rest rooms, display areas, and
maintenance closets.
   (d)    "Seat" means the number of seating units installed or indicated, or
each twenty-four linear inches of benches, pews or space for loose chairs or
similar seating facilities; spacing of rows shall be thirty inches on center.
   (e)    "Employees" means the maximum number of employees on any two
successive shifts.
   (f)    "Required minimum parking spaces" means that where the computation
results in a fractional unit, one additional off-street parking space shall be
provided.
   Driveways, parking area pavement, curbs and bumper guards shall be
constructed in accord with standards established by the City Engineer.

similar to the proposed building or use.
(Ord. 2003-34.  Passed 6-23-03.)
   1321.40  MODIFICATION OF SCHEDULE.
   An existing building or use which does not conform to parking requirements
as set forth in Section
1321.31 and where land is not available on the same lot or adjoining lot, the
Commission may modify the location of parking facilities to permit such
facilities within 400 feet walking distance of the building or use.
(Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-29-61.)
   1321.41  SEPARATE OR COMBINED USE OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   A building, or group of buildings, containing two or more uses,
operating normally during the same hours, and which have different off-street
parking requirements shall provide spaces for not less than the sum of the
spaces required for each use. Combined use of parking facilities may be
permitted where uses adjacent to Institutions, as set forth in the Schedule of
Section
1321.31, may assume that up to, but not more than, fifty percent of their
requirements may be shared in adjacent Institutional parking areas which
normally have different hours of operation. However, where there is such a
sharing of facilities by different uses and owners, there shall be a contract
covering a period of time as may be required by the Commission, provided that
should any of the uses be changed or the facilities discontinued, then the
required spaces for the use remaining shall be provided elsewhere as a
condition precedent to the continued use of such building or buildings. 
(Ord. 2003-34.  Passed 6-23-03.)
   1321.42  COORDINATED PARKING PLANS.
   Planning Commission may waive side yard setback requirements where adjacent
uses provide a coordinated parking plan which addresses shared access and
parking lot landscaping and, in the opinion of the Law Director, is supported
by appropriate access and cross easements.
(Ord. 2003-34.  Passed 6-23-03.)
   1321.43  PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING AND PERIMETER BUFFERING.
   (a)   Intent. In order to mitigate visual impacts on adjacent uses,
particularly residential uses, and to protect the health, safety and welfare of
the community through the reduction of noise, air and visual pollution, any
change in use; or any new, or substantially expanded use; shall provide parking
lot landscaping and perimeter buffering in compliance with the requirements of
this Section.
   (b)    Applicability. For the purposes of this Section, substantial
expansion in use shall be defined as an increase of more than twenty percent
(20%) in gross floor area or the addition of the equivalent of more than ten
percent of the existing off-street parking spaces designated for the use.
   (c)    Standards. Parking lot landscaping and perimeter buffering for any
outdoor parking areas shall be provided in accordance with Section
1321.43(f), and (g). Planning Commission may require additional landscaping and
buffering or authorize variances from these requirements after consideration of
site conditions, setbacks, line of sight, noise, nuisance or site aesthetics.
      (1)    Responsibility for installation shall be with the person in
control of developing the project whether as owner, lessee, tenant, or
otherwise (hereinafter referred to as "Owner".
      (2)    Locations. Perimeter buffering and landscaping shall be provided
between the vehicle use area and the public right-of-way; between vehicular use
areas and private street easements; in side and rear yards between non-
residential and residential uses; and, in side and rear yards between multi-
family uses and single family uses. Interior landscaping for vehicular use
areas shall be provided in all parking areas.
      (3)    Unless specifically approved by Planning Commission, no structure
shall be permitted in a required landscape area other than a wall, fence, or
earth berm.
   (d)    Requirements for Submission. When required by these regulations, a
“Parking Lot Landscaping and Buffering Plan” shall be prepared and included in
drawings submitted for Planning Commission approval as part of the regular Site
Plan Review process. The "Parking Lot Landscaping and Buffering Plan" shall be
prepared at a reasonable scale and shall include the following information:
      (1)   Name of the applicant/owner.
      (2)    Name, address and phone number of the person or firm responsible
for the preparation of the plan.
      (3)    All existing and proposed buildings and other structures, paved
areas, planted areas, utility poles, fire hydrants, light standards, signs,
fences and other permanent features to be added and or retained on the site.
      (4)    Material to be removed or retained.
      (5)    Existing and proposed streets, sidewalks, curbs, and gutters,
railroad tracks, drainage ditches and other public or semi-public improvements
within and immediately adjacent to the site.
      (6)    Contour lines shall be shown if the grades are in excess of six
percent (6%) slope.
      (7)    Proposed elevation at sufficient locations and existing elevations
of the site to clearly show the drainage patterns.
      (8)    Tabular listings of existing plant material to be retained and
proposed plant material within the buffer yard or landscape area with typical
planting details for trees, shrubs and ground cover within the landscaped area.
   (e)    Approval. No site plan approval will be issued by the Planning
Commission, and no occupancy permit will be issued by the Building Commissioner
until the “Parking Lot Landscaping and Buffering Plan” has received final
approval. Approval of the "Parking Lot Landscaping and Buffering Plan" is
conditioned upon satisfaction of the following criteria:
      (1)   Landscaping and perimeter buffering material shall be fully
installed on the site by completion of construction; or,
      (2)   If not feasible due to seasonal conditions, within one planting
season after completion of construction. A guaranteed agreement regarding the
postponed improvement must be secured with a letter of credit, cash escrow or
other instrument in an amount equal to the cost of such installation.
   (f)   Perimeter Landscaping.  Parking lots containing six (6) spaces or more
shall provide perimeter landscaping meeting the following minimum requirements:
      (l)    Buffer area between the public right-of-way and the parking area,
and between private street easements and the parking area, shall be of a size
equivalent to six (6) square feet of area for every linear foot of roadway
frontage. If site constraints prohibit the provision of this amount of buffer
area, Planning Commission may approve a plan with a buffer area equal to the
length of the roadway frontage, minus ingress and egress driveways, multiplied
by six (6) feet. (Example: Parcel frontage is 150 feet. Driveway width equals
30 feet. Therefore, the frontage minus drive width is 120 feet times 6 feet, or
720 square feet of buffer area). Where it is not practical to provide a buffer

which creates a need for an increase of more than fifteen percent (15%) in off-
street parking or any whole unit of additional loading spaces as required
herein, additional facilities shall be required to the extent of need created
by the addition or enlargement. If the original structure or use is
inadequately served by parking facilities relative to the standards contained
herein,  Planning Commission may also require the addition of parking spaces or
loading areas necessary to bring the total required spaces into compliance with
these regulations. In making such a determination, Planning Commission shall
consider traffic flow, congestion, pedestrian or traffic hazards caused
directly or indirectly by the deficiency. However, off-street parking need not
exceed the total amount of off-street parking spaces required for the entire
use if constructed new.  (Ord. 2003-34.  Passed 6-23-03.)

   1329.10  INTENT.
   (a)   Within the districts established by this Zoning Ordinance and
amendments thereto, or amendments that may be adopted, buildings, lots and uses
of buildings and land prevail which were lawful before this Zoning Ordinance
was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited under the terms of this
Zoning Ordinance or future amendments.
   (b)   It is the intent of this Zoning Ordinance to permit such
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, although they are
considered to be incompatible with the permitted uses in the districts involved
and with the land use plan of the City. It is further the intent that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, but may be
changed only to a more restrictive use, and to regulate the rebuilding if
substantially destroyed, except in cases where the nonconforming aspect of a
building is due to a front yard set back on Euclid Avenue of less than seventy
feet from the street right of way line. Furthermore, the continuation of a
lawful nonconformity shall not be construed as a reason for permitting
nonconformities not specifically permitted in this Zoning Ordinance. (Ord.
1980-31. Passed 10-13-80.)
   1329.20  NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS.
   A building or other structure existing lawfully at the time this Zoning
Ordinance became effective, but which does not conform as to area or width of
lot, yard dimensions, lot coverage, height of building, use intended or other
regulations of the district in which it is located, is a lawful nonconforming
building. Such building may be continued to be occupied so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)    Maintenance and Repair. A nonconforming building may continue to be
used, maintained and repaired; provided, however, no structural parts shall be
replaced except when required by law to restore to a safe condition, or to make
the building or use conform to the regulations of this district in which it is
located.
   (b)    Additions. A nonconforming building shall not be altered, added to or
enlarged unless the additions and original building are made to conform to the
yard, coverage and height regulations of the district in which it is located,
except a nonconforming dwelling may be altered, modernized or enlarged,
provided the alterations and enlargements conform to all the yard regulations.
   (c)    Moving. A nonconforming building shall not be moved in whole or in
part to any other location on the lot or other premises, unless every portion
of such building so moved is made to conform to all regulations of the district
in which it is to be located.
   (d)    Restoration of Damaged Building. If a nonconforming building is
damaged or destroyed by any cause, to the extent of fifty percent or less of
its reproduction value, those portions so destroyed or damaged may be restored
but to not more than its former size, provided such restoration is completed
within a period of one year from date of damage or destruction. If such a
building is occupied by a nonconforming use prior to damage, such use may be
continued.
If a nonconforming building is damaged or destroyed by more than fifty percent
of its reproduction value, no repairing or reconstruction shall be made unless
every portion of the building is made to conform to regulations of the
districts in which the building construction contractors, one to be appointed
by the owner, one to be appointed by the City and the third to be selected by
mutual consent of the two parties.
   (e)    Euclid Avenue Setback.  Nonconforming buildings so classified because
they do not meet the seventy foot front yard set back on Euclid Avenue may be
altered, modernized or added to, provided the alterations and additions are
subject to the following provisions:
      (1)    Off-street parking regulations and loading regulations shall
comply with the provisions of the existing ordinances governing such
regulations.
      (2)    Side yard regulations, rear yard regulations, lot coverage
regulations, building height regulations and use regulations shall comply with
the provisions of the existing ordinances governing such regulations.
      (3)    New facades may be permitted on existing nonconforming building
elevations provided the new material does not exceed six inches nor encroach on
the public right of way.
      (4)    New overhangs may be permitted on existing nonconforming building
provided the new material does not require ground supports nor project more
than three feet from the building nor project into the public right of way.
      (5)    Enlargement of a nonconforming building may be extended into the
side and rear yards, and shall further comply with all of the provisions of the
Building Code, existing ordinances governing such regulations and the
provisions of subsection (e)(1) and (2).
         (Ord. 1980-32. Passed 10-13-80.)
   1329.30  NONCONFORMING USE OF BUILDINGS.
   A use of a building existing lawfully at the time this Zoning Ordinance
became effective, but which does not conform to the use regulations, including
the sign regulations, parking or loading regulations of the district in which
it is located, is a nonconforming use of a building and may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)    Change of Use. The nonconforming use of a building may only be
changed to a conforming use, or to a use permitted in a more restricted
district if approved by the  Commission. Thereafter it shall not be changed
back to the former nonconforming use. For this purpose, the districts shall be
considered from most to least restrictive, as set forth in Section
1305.10.
   (b)    Expansion of Use. A nonconforming use of part of a building may only
be expanded or extended throughout those parts of a building which were
manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended so as to
occupy any land outside such building.
   (c)    Discontinuance of Use. If a nonconforming use within a building or
portion thereof is discontinued for a continuous period of two years, any
future use of such building, or portion thereof, so discontinued, shall be in
conformity with the use regulations of the district in which the building is
located.
   (d)    Nonconforming Signs. A sign, existing lawfully at the time this
Zoning Ordinance became effective, but which does not conform with the sign
regulations of the district in which it is located, may be maintained and
structural or electrical parts may be repaired or restored to a safe condition
only if required by law. Otherwise, a nonconforming sign shall not be altered
or moved unless it is made to conform with this Zoning Ordinance. If any sign
or part thereof is damaged or destroyed to more than fifty percent of its
reproduction value, or taken down, it shall not be rebuilt or relocated unless
it shall be made to comply with the regulations of the district in which it is
located.
   (e)    Nonconforming Parking Facilities. A building, or use, existing
lawfully at the time this Zoning Ordinance or an amendment thereto became
effective, but which does not conform with the off-street parking or off-street
loading regulations, may be occupied by the existing use without such parking
and/or loading facilities being provided. Any parking spaces that may be
provided shall be in accord with the regulations and standards set forth in
Chapter
1321. However, if the existing building is altered so that there is an increase
in the number of dwelling units, seating capacity or floor area, or if the use
is changed to a use requiring more seating capacity or floor area, or if the
use is changed to a use requiring more off- street parking and loading
facilities shall be provided at least equal to the number of spaces required
for the entire building or use in accord with the schedule as set forth in
Sections
1321.31 and
1321.70.
   (f)    Nonconforming as to Performance Standards. A building or use existing
lawfully at  the time this Zoning Ordinance became effective, but which is
nonconforming as to  one or more of the performance standards, shall not be
required to conform therewith except at such times that the building or use is
changed or expanded. (Ord. 1961-103.  Passed 12-29-61.)
   1329.40  NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND.
   A vacant lot or parcel of land, nonconforming as to use or dimension and
existing lawfully at the time this Zoning Ordinance or an amendment thereto
became effective, but which does not conform with the use and/or dimension
regulations of the district in which it is located, is a nonconforming use of
land, and such use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions.
   (a)    Expansion of Use. The nonconforming use of a lot, or part thereof, is
expanded or extended onto other parts of the lot.
   (b)    Discontinuance of Use. If the nonconforming use of a lot, or part
thereof, is discontinued for a continuous period of two years, any future use
of such lot of part thereof so discontinued shall be in conformity with the use
regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (c)    Insufficient Size. A lot, or lots, nonconforming as to lot area and/
or lot width requirements of the district in which it is located, existing
lawfully at the time this Zoning Ordinance or an amendment thereto became
effective, may be developed in accordance with regulations set forth in Section
1309.43.
      (Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-29-61.)
   1329.50  NONCONFORMING USE DUE TO RECLASSIFICATION.
   (a)   The foregoing provisions of this chapter shall also apply to the
buildings, structures, land or other uses hereafter becoming nonconforming as a
result of reclassification of districts or of other amendments made to this
Zoning Ordinance or of future reclassification of districts or of other
amendments made thereto.
   (b)   Buildings and uses that were conforming or lawfully existing
nonconforming buildings and uses under Ordinance No. 1931-90 and become
nonconforming under this Zoning Ordinance shall be deemed lawful nonconforming
buildings and uses.
(Ord. 61-103.  Passed 12-29-61.)
   1329.60  CHANGE FROM NONCONFORMING USE.
   (a)   A nonconforming building or use shall cease to be considered as such
whenever it complies with the requirements of the district in which it is
located and shall not be resumed thereafter.
   (b)   A proposed building conforming in all respects to this Zoning
Ordinance shall be permitted on the same zone lot as a nonconforming building
or use, provided the lot area, lot width and number and location of parking
spaces of the nonconforming use and the conforming building equal the sum of
the lot area, lot width and parking spaces required for each use, and provided
the distances between the conforming building and nonconforming building or use
are equal to the distances required if the two uses were on adjacent zone lots;
provided, however, that in a one-family and two-family district, only one main
building shall be permitted on a zone lot. (Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-29-61.)

   1331.10  CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS; WHERE REQUIRED.
   Conditional Use Permits shall be required for certain types of uses, so
classified because of their uncommon or unique characteristics, infrequency of
occurrence, large area requirements or for other reasons. Such use shall not be
permitted by right. The conditional uses enumerated in this Zoning Ordinance
may be permitted under specific conditions in the district enumerated, only if
they conform to standards provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 1966-100. Passed 12-12-66).
   1331.20  APPLICATION FOR PERMITS.
   An application for a Conditional Use Permit shall be made by the builder,
owner or his agent to the Planning Commission and shall be accompanied by such
drawings and/or plans and/ or a statement so as to fully describe and set forth
all elements of the proposed use. Such data supplied with the permit
application shall describe in detail the proposed use to the extent that the
Planning Commission can have no doubt as to the use of the proposed use, and
can determine the effect upon surrounding properties, and can evaluate the
effect of the proposed use upon traffic, fire hazards, public utilities and the
public health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of Wickliffe. The Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing on each application for a conditional
use permit and notice of such hearing shall be mailed to the owners of the
property in question and to those property owners deemed by the Planning
Commission to be affected by the proposed use. Notices shall be mailed at least
fifteen days before the hearing. If an application is received at least five
days before a scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission, it shall take
action within ninety days after the meeting, unless a longer period of time is
agreed to by the applicant. In the event the Planning Commission fails to act
within such period of time, the application for a Conditional Use Permit shall
be deemed to be approved.
(Ord. 1966-99. Passed 12-12-66.)
   1331.21  CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT FEE.
   The application for a Conditional Use Permit shall be accompanied by the

advertising the public hearing and the mailing of notices. 
(Ord. 2003-34.  Passed 6-23-03.)
   1331.30  STANDARDS FOR EVALUATING APPLICATIONS.
   An application for a Conditional Use Permit shall not be approved, unless
the Commission finds that the proposed use complies with the following
conditions and standards.
   (a)    To be approved in a Residential District, the Commission must find
that:
      (1)    The proposed use will be properly located in relation to the
secondary and local streets and pedestrian circulation pattern; and
      (2)    The proposed use will generate only a minimum of traffic through a
residential neighborhood if locating along a local street; and
      (3)    The proposed use is necessary to serve the surrounding residential
areas, which neighborhood cannot be served satisfactorily if the same use is
located in a nearby, less restrictive district where it may be permitted by
right; and
      (4)    The location, design and operation of such use would not
discourage or interfere with the appropriate development or impair the value of
the surrounding Residential District.
   (b)    To be approved in any other district, the Commission must find that:
      (1)    The proposed use is necessary to serve community needs in existing
facilities located in a less restrictive or more remote district in which the
use may be permitted by right are inadequate.
      (2)    The proposed use would not be closer than appropriate in the
particular situation to schools, churches and other places of assembly; and
      (3)    The location, size, intensity and layout of the proposed use and
operations would conform to the noise, smoke, dust, odor, fume, vibration and/
or glare performance standards of the district; and
      (4)    The proposed use will form a harmonious part of the district
wherein it is proposed to be located, considering such features as convenience
of access and relationship of one use to another; and
      (5)    Because of its limited size, modern process or equipment, the
performance of the proposed use is such that it should be properly permitted in
a less restrictive district than the district in which it is permitted by
right; and
      (6)    The hours of operation of the proposed use are similar to a use
permitted in a district, and that the proposed use will not generate more
traffic than normal for the district.
         (Ord. 1966-99. Passed 12-12-66.)
   1331.40  APPROVAL.
   (a)   The Planning Commission shall make a determination based on the
information available or it may request additional information. If the
application for the conditional use is approved, the Commission shall set forth
any specific terms, conditions and safeguards that shall be required so that
the proposed use will conform with the intent and standards of the district.
The Commission shall then instruct the Building Commissioner to issue a
Conditional Use Permit. The Council shall be notified of such action.
   (b)   After the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, an application for
a Conditional Use Permit may be submitted by an owner for any existing use
requiring such permit and it shall be issued.
(Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-29-61.)
   1331.41  INSPECTION FOR COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   When a Conditional Use Permit has been approved by the Planning
Commission, which sets forth any specific terms, conditions, and safeguards
that shall be required so that the use will conform with the intent and
standards of the district, the Building Commissioner shall inspect the premises
after one year and annually thereafter for compliance to said specific terms,
conditions, and safeguards.
   (b)   When a Conditional Use Permit has been granted to an owner or his
agent and the said Conditional Use Permit has been assigned or transferred to
another owner or his agent, the new owner or his agent shall not be issued a
Certificate of Occupancy until the Building Commissioner determines that the
Conditional Use Permit currently complies with its specific terms, conditions,
and safeguards.
   (c)   The Planning Commission may revoke a Conditional Use Permit upon the
recommendation of the Building Commissioner upon determining that the use does
not comply with said specific terms, conditions, and safeguards of such permit.
(Ord. 2012-48.  Passed 6-25-12.)
   1331.50  REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   (a)   A Conditional Use Permit shall become null and void if construction on
the proposed Project has not begun within one year after approval by the
Commission.
   (b)   The Commission may revoke a Conditional Use Permit upon recommendation
of the Building Commissioner, upon determining that the use does not comply
with the terms and conditions of such permit.

   1333.10  DETERMINATION OF SIMILAR USES.
   Upon application for a permit for a building or use not specifically listed
in any of the permitted building or use classifications in any of the
districts, or on its own initiative, additions or clarifications thereto may be
recommended by the Commission in compliance with the following standards:
   (a)    Such use is not listed in any other classification of permitted
buildings or uses; and its characteristics are most similar to the uses
permitted in the zoning classification to it which it is to be added than to
any other classification; and
   (b)    Such a use is more appropriate to, and conforms more closely to the
basic characteristics of the classification to which it is to be added than to
any other classification; and
   (c)    Such a use does not create dangers to health and safety, and does not
create offensive noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare or other
objectionable influences to an extent greater than the other uses listed in the
classification to which it is to be added; and
   (d)    Such a use does not generate traffic to a greater extent that the
other uses listed in the classification to which it is to be added.
      (Ord. 2003-34.  Passed 6-23-03.)
   1333.20  COMMISSION ACTION.
   The Commission may recommend such additions or clarifications to the
Council. If Council by a majority vote of its members concurs with the

appropriate section of that use group, and shall be added thereto in the
published text of this amended Zoning Ordinance with a notation indicating that
the addition was made in accord with the provisions of this section.

   (e)   The  Board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance
of witnesses, to administer oaths, to compel testimony, to produce reports,
findings and other evidence pertinent to any issue referred to the Board for a
decision.
   (f)   The Board shall entertain a rehearing on a case if new evidence is
submitted; however, once a case has been decided, such rehearing shall not be
held for a period of at least six months from the date of the previous
decision. (Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-29-61.)
   1335.51  QUORUM AND VOTE.
   (a)   A quorum shall consist of three members, and the concurring vote of at
least three members shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement,
decision or determination of any duly authorized administrative officer.
   (b)   A member of the Board shall not be qualified to vote if he has not
attended the public hearing or is he has a direct or indirect interest in the
issue appealed.
(Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-29-61.)
   1335.52  RECORD OF DECISIONS.
   The Board is authorized to engage the services of a secretary, and shall
provide a detailed report of all its proceedings, setting forth its reasons for
decisions, the vote of each member participating therein and the absence of a
member or his failure to vote. Immediately following the Board's decision, such
record, including conditions prescribed by the Board, shall be mailed forthwith
to each interested party noted therein. Any permit issued in pursuance of any
decision of the Board shall have incorporated therein any special conditions
prescribed by the Board.
(Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-29-61.)
   1335.60  REASONS FOR GRANTING VARIANCES.
   The Board of Appeals shall have the power, in specific cases, to vary the
application of certain provisions of this Zoning Ordinance in order that the
public health, safety, convenience, comfort and general welfare may be
safeguarded and substantial justice done for the following reasons:
   (a)    Where unnecessary hardships would result from the literal application
of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. Hardships which are unavoidable if
the purpose and intent of this Zoning Ordinance are to be realized, such as a
theoretical loss or limited possibilities of economic advantage, are not
unnecessary hardships. Likewise, a hardship based on conditions created by the
owner is not an unnecessary hardship. It must be found that there are peculiar
and special hardships as applicable to the property involved which are separate
and distinct from the general hardship in the district; and
   (b)    Where exceptional circumstances or conditions, only applicable to the
property involved or to the intended use of the property, do not apply to other
property within the same zone. The mere fact that the owner of the one parcel
might apply prior to the owner of the other parcels in the same area would not
give him a right to a variance and thus grant a special privilege to an
individual when such variance would be necessarily denied to others. It must be
found, on the other hand, that there are exceptional conditions justifying a
variance on one lot, such as topographical or geological conditions or type of 
adjoining developments, and that a variance would be justified on any lot where
the same exceptional circumstances prevail; and
   (c)    Where granting of a variance will not be materially detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located. The mere existence of an
unnecessary hardship or other exceptional circumstances is not ipso facto
evidence for granting of a variance, for such hardships must be balanced
against the present conditions and extent such a variance would interfere with
the proper future development and rights of adjacent property; and
   (d)    That the granting of a variance will not be contrary to the general
purpose, intent and objectives of this Zoning Ordinance or other adopted plans.
A variance merely permits that which is contemplated in this Zoning Ordinance
for unnecessary hardships and exceptional circumstances. On the other hand,
that which was not contemplated in this Zoning Ordinance, although deemed
desirable, should be effected by amendments.  (Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-29-61.)
   1335.70  STANDARDS FOR GRANTING VARIANCES.
   (a)    Variations from Area Regulations.
      (1)    Lot area. The Board shall not grant variations of lot area
requirements in Two-family or Multi-family Districts to permit residences other
than one- family dwellings as provided in Section
1309.43.
      (2)    Floor area. The Board may permit variation of not more than ten
percent decrease of the minimum floor area requirements of a dwelling, if by
reasons of greater lot frontage or area, or side yard widths than required, or
by exceptionally skillful arrangement of the house or site plans, the result of
such variation will be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood.
      (3)    Sign area. The Board may permit variations of not more than twenty
percent increase in the maximum sign area permitted where the setback of an
adjoining building is substantially less than required.
   (b)    Variations from Lot Width Regulations. The Board may permit
variations of not more than twenty percent decrease of the required lot width
in Residential Districts for a lot of record, if it is of such restricted area
that it cannot be appropriately improved without such modification, and
provided the owner owns no adjoining land.
   (c)    Variations from Yard Regulations.
      (1)   The Board may permit variations of yard regulations of not more
than twenty percent decrease in a Residential District for a lot of record if,
because of peculiar shape or for topography of the lot, such variations are
necessary to obtain appropriate development, provided the Board finds that
privacy will not be impaired, and that light and ventilation will be adequate
on such lot and not unduly diminished on adjoining lots.
      (2)   In a Residential District the Board may permit a modification of
the side yard regulation so as to allow a one-story garage to be attached to an
existing dwelling. Such garage may project into a required side yard, provided
the resulting distance, including projections shall be not less than three feet
to the nearest lot line and not less than twenty feet to a dwelling on an
adjoining lot.
      (3)   In Residential Districts the Board may permit modifications of the
side yard regulations for main and accessory buildings on corner lots of
record, provided the Board finds that privacy of the occupants and the sight
lines of the street intersection will be not unduly impaired and the adjoining
property will not be unduly deprived of light and ventilation.
      (4)   In Residential Districts the Board may permit a variation of side
lot regulations of not more than thirty-three and one-third percent decrease on
lots of record which are less than fifty feet in width or which have a depth of
less than 120 feet, so as to allow a one-story garage to be constructed,
relocated or added to, provided the Board finds that privacy will not be
impaired and that light and ventilation will be adequate and not unduly
diminished on adjoining lots.
   (d)    Variations from Height Restrictions. The Board may permit increase in
height of a proposed or existing building or part thereof to the same height as
an adjacent building nonconforming as to height, if such increased height is
essential to the completion of the building as originally planned and that the
adjoining properties will not be unduly deprived of light and air.
   (e)    Variations from Nonconforming Building and Use.
      (1)   The Board shall have no powers to authorize, as a variance, the
establishment of a nonconforming building or use, extensions of or changes in
nonconforming uses where none previously existed, except in terms of this
section and Chapter
1329 of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   The Board may permit variations of not more than twenty percent of
increase in the area of signs as set forth in this Zoning Ordinance in the
rebuilding or relocation of an existing sign, provided the Board finds that the
sign will not create unsightliness or unduly decrease the visibility of an
adjoining establishment or sign.
   (f)    Landscape and Protective Features. The Board, upon making various
determinations, shall endeavor to protect adjoining property, to assure safety
of pedestrians and convenience of traffic movements within the area in
question, and may require the provision of curbs, guard rails, wall, fences or
other landscape or protective features, to further the purposes of this Zoning
Ordinance.
(Ord.  2003-34.  Passed 6-23-03.)
   1335.80  LAPSE OF VARIANCES.
   A variance once grated shall not be withdrawn or changed unless there is a
change in circumstances, or if, after the expiration of one year, no
substantial construction is done in accordance with the terms and conditions
for which such variance was granted. The Building Commissioner shall give a
notice in writing, and thirty days thereafter, the variance shall be deemed
null and void. All regulations governing such premises in question shall return
to those in effect before the variance was granted. (Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-
29-61.)
   1335.90  APPEALS TO COURTS.
   Appeals from Decisions of Board. A person aggrieved by a decision of the
Board in regard to a request for a variance as set forth in this Zoning
Ordinance may appeal the decision in accordance with the laws of the State.
(Ord. 1979-3. Passed 4-9-79.)

   Whenever a violation of this Zoning Ordinance occurs, or is alleged to have
occurred, any person may file a written complaint. Such complaint stating fully
the causes and basis thereof shall be filed with the Building Commissioner. The

   1337.20  ENTRY AND INSPECTION.
   The Building Commissioner, in his capacity as a building inspector and code
enforcement officer is a "Law enforcement officer" as defined in Section

she is authorized to make inspections of properties and structures in order to
examine and survey the same, at any reasonable hour, for the purpose of
enforcing the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. Prior to making such
inspection the Building Commissioner shall attempt to obtain the permission of
the owner or occupant to inspect. If such permission is denied or cannot be

Commissioner shall write a stop work order and post it on the premises

Commissioner, shall constitute a violation of this Zoning Ordinance subject to

   1341.10  INTENT.
   This Zoning Ordinance may be amended periodically in order to keep pace with
new zoning techniques and changes in enabling legislation governing municipal
planning and zoning.
   This Zoning Ordinance may also be amended when a general hardship prevails
in a given area or when new extensive developments affecting the use of land
are being planned.
(Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-29-61.)
   1341.20  INITIATION OF AMENDMENT.
   A proposed amendment to the zoning text or map may be initiated either by
the Planning Commission or a member of Council. If initiated by Council, the
ordinance to amend the Zoning Ordinance shall be referred to the Commission
before action is taken by Council.
(Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-29-61.)
   1341.30  ACTION BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   The Commission shall be permitted not more than sixty days following the
date of referral of the proposed amendment. The Commission may hold a public
hearing thereon before making its recommendation to Council.
   The Commission may approve or disapprove the amendment, either in whole or
in part, and submit its recommendation to Council. Failure to act within the
time allowed shall be deemed approval by the Commission unless Council has
agreed upon an extension of time.
(Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-29-61)
   1341.40  ACTION BY COUNCIL.
   Upon receiving the recommendation of the Commission on a proposed amendment,
or after not receiving a recommendation from the Commission within the allowed
time, Council shall advertise for and hold a public hearing. For all proposed
text or map amendments, at least one notice shall be given in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City at least thirty days before the date of the
hearing.
   If a map amendment proposes to rezone or redistrict ten contiguous parcels
or less, notice of the hearing shall also be mailed by the City Clerk, by first
class mail, at least twenty days before the hearing date, to owners of property
within and contiguous to, and directly across the street from, the parcel or
parcels subject to the proposed amendment. The addresses of such owners shall
be obtained from the addresses appearing on the County Auditor's tax list or
the County Treasurer's mailing list. The failure to mail notices to owners
whose names do not appear on such lists, as well as the failure of delivery of
such notice, shall not invalidate any such amendment.
   The published and mailed notification shall set forth the time and place of
the public hearing and a summary of the proposed amendment. During the thirty
days preceding the hearing, a copy of the text of such amendment, and/or the
map showing the area proposed to be changed and reports submitted by the
Commission shall be on file for public inspection in the office of the City
Clerk.
   After the public hearing Council may adopt the proposal as recommended by
the Commission by majority vote of its members. If Council modifies the
proposal, it may resubmit the proposed modification to the Commission for
further consideration, or it may adopt the proposed amendment without the
approval of the Commission by a vote of not less than a two- thirds majority of
Council membership. The City Clerk shall submit to the Commission a copy of any
action taken by Council in regard to the Ordinance.
(Ord. 1961-103. Passed 12-29-61.)

these regulations, the applicant may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals for
relief.  If the Board of Zoning Appeals finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations

done and the public interest secured, provided that the variance, exception, or

not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to
other property;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to the
property for which the relief is sought and are not applicable generally to
other property;
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape,
geographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations is carried out;
      (4)   The relief sought will not in any manner vary the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance, or Official Map, except that those documents may be amended
in the manner prescribed by law.

conditions, the Board of Zoning Appeals and Planning Commission may require
such conditions as will, in their judgement, secure substantially the purposes
described in Section

(Ord. 2004-40.  Passed 5-24-04.)
   1365.03  SKETCH PLAT.
   (a)   Preliminary Project Meeting.  Before preparing the sketch plat for a
subdivision, the applicant shall schedule an appointment and meet with the
Building Commissioner to discuss procedures for approval of a subdivision plat
and the requirements as to the general layout of streets, for reservations of
land, street improvements, drainage, sewerage, fire protection, and similar
matters, as well as the availability of existing services, including schools. 
The Building Commissioner shall also advise the applicant, when appropriate, to

approve those  aspects of the subdivision plat coming within their
jurisdiction.
   (b)   Application.  Prior to subdividing land and after meeting with the
Building Commissioner, the owner of land, or his authorized agent, shall file

date that the sketch plat was submitted.
      (1)   Minor Subdivision.  If the sketch plat constitutes a minor
subdivision, the Administrator shall place the matter on the next available
regular meeting agenda of the Planning Commission for formal approval,
disapproval, or conditional approval of the sketch plat. The Planning
Commission shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the sketch plat
within thirty (30) days from the Official Submission date.  Subsequent to
approval, conditional approval by the Planning Commission, the applicant may

subdivision plat as provided in these regulations.  If the sketch plat is
disapproved by the Planning Commission the applicant may appeal to the Council
as provided in Section
1365.15.  The applicant shall have one year from the date the sketch plat is
approved by the Planning Commission (or Council) to submit a final subdivision
plat, after which time a new sketch plat must be submitted for approval.
      (2)   Major Subdivision.
         A.   Notice to Proceed - If the sketch plat constitutes a major 
subdivision, Building Commissioner shall issue a Notice to Proceed only if the
sketch plat complies with all applicable laws governing the subdivision of
land.  The Notice to Proceed shall include, as appropriate, recommended changes
in the sketch plat to be incorporated into the preliminary plat to assist the
applicant in obtaining preliminary plat approval from the Planning Commission. 
If the Building Commissioner determines that the sketch plat does not comply
with all applicable laws governing the subdivision of land and the applicant
refuses to modify the sketch plat, the Building Commissioner shall issue a
Notice of Noncompliance.  The Building Commissioner shall issue either a Notice
to Proceed or the Notice of Noncompliance not later then twenty (20) days after
the date on which the sketch plat was submitted.  After receipt of a Notice to
Proceed, the applicant must first file an application for approval of a
preliminary plat, as provided in these regulations, before filing for final
subdivision plat approval.
         B.   Referral of Sketch Plat - If the Building Commissioner issues a
Notice to Proceed, he shall transmit the sketch plat for review to appropriate
officials or agencies of the City, adjoining municipalities, school and special
districts, and other official bodies as he deems necessary or as mandated by
law, including any review required by metropolitan, regional or state bodies
under applicable state or federal law.  The Building Commissioner shall request
that all officials and agencies to whom a request for review has been made,

Comprehensive Plan.
   (d)   Public Improvements.  The Planning Commission may require that all
public improvements be installed and dedicated prior to the signing of the
final subdivision plat by the Chairman of the Planning Commission.  If the

may direct.  The application for a site preparation permit shall include an
erosion and sediment control plan.  The Building Commissioner must approve the
erosion and sediment control plan prior to issuance of a site preparation
permit.  Upon receipt of the permit the developer may commence construction to
the grades and elevation  required by the approve preliminary plat.

plat, the applicant may request of the Building Commissioner that an amendment
be made in the approval or conditional approval of the preliminary plat.  Under
regulations established by the Planning Commission, the Building Commissioner
may agree to proposed amendments that are deemed to be minor.  If the proposed

   1367.01  IMPROVEMENTS AND SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENT AGREEMENT.
   (a)   Completion of Improvements.  Before final subdivision plat is signed
by the Chairman of Planning Commission, all applicants shall be required to
complete, in accordance with the Planning Commission's decision and to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer, all the street, sanitary and other public
improvements, including lot improvements on  the individual lots of the
subdivision, as required in these regulations,  specified in the final
subdivision plat and as approved by the Planning  Commission, and to dedicate
those public improvements to the local  government, free and clear of all liens
and encumbrances on the  dedicated property and public improvements.
   (b)   Subdivision Improvement Agreement and Guarantee.
      (1)   Agreement.  The Planning Commission in its sole discretion may
waive the requirement that the applicant complete and dedicate all public
improvements prior to approval of the final subdivision plat and, as an
alternate, permit the applicant to enter into a subdivision improvement
agreement by which the subdivider covenants to complete all required public
improvements no later than two (2) years following the date on which the
Chairman of the Planning Commission signs the final subdivision plat.  The
applicant shall covenant to maintain each required public improvement for a
period of one (1) year following the acceptance by the governing body of the
dedication of that completed public improvement and also shall warrant that all
required public improvements will be free from defect for a period of three (3)
years following the acceptance by the City Council of the dedication of the
last completed public improvement.  The subdivision improvement agreement shall
contain such other terms and conditions agreed to by the applicant, the
Planning Commission and City Council.
      (2)   Covenants to Run.  The subdivision improvement agreement shall
provide that the covenants contained in the agreement shall run with the land
and bind all successors, heirs, and assignees of the subdivider.  The
subdivision improvement agreement will be approved by Council, pursuant to
applicable state and local laws and shall be recorded in the Clerk and
Recorder's Office of Lake County.
      (3)   Security.  Whenever Council permits an applicant to enter into a
subdivision improvement agreement, it shall require the applicant to provide a
letter of credit or cash escrow as security for the promises contained in the
subdivision improvement agreement.  Either security shall be in an amount equal
to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the estimated cost of completion of the
required public improvements, including lot improvements.  The issuer of the
letter of credit or the escrow agent, as applicable, shall be approved by the
Law Director and be acceptable to Council.
         A.   Letter of Credit.  If the applicant posts a letter of credit as
security for its promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement,
the credit shall (1) be irrevocable; (2) be for a term sufficient to cover the
completion, maintenance, and warranty periods in Section
1367.01(b); and (3) require only that the City present the credit with a sight
draft and an affidavit signed by the Law Director attesting to the
municipality's right to draw funds under the credit.
         B.   Cash Escrow.  If the applicant posts and cash escrow as security
for its promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement, the escrow
instructions shall provide: (1) that the subdivider will have no right to a
return of any of the funds except as provided in Section
1367.03 (b); and (2) that the escrow agent shall have a legal duty to deliver
the funds to the municipality whenever the City Law Director presents an
affidavit to the agent attesting to the municipality's right to receive funds
whether or not the subdivider protests that right.  If and when the City
accepts the offer of dedication for the last completed required public
improvement, the City shall execute a waiver of its right to receive all but
twenty-five percent (25%) of the funds represented by the letter of credit or
cash escrow if the subdivider is not in breach of the subdivision improvement
agreement.  The residual funds shall be security for the subdivider's covenant
to maintain the required public improvements and its warranty that the
improvements are free from defect.
      (c)   Temporary Improvement.  The applicant shall build and pay for all
costs of temporary improvements and shall maintain those temporary improvements
for the period specified by Council.  Prior to construction of any temporary
facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the City, a separate
subdivision improvement agreement and a letter of credit or cash escrow in an
appropriate amount for temporary facilities, which agreement and credit or
escrow shall ensure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed,
maintained, and removed.
   (d)   Costs of Improvements.  All required improvements shall be made by the
developer, at its expense, without reimbursement by the City or any improvement
district except that, as may be allowed under state law, the developer may form
or cause to be formed a special district or districts to construct and finance
the construction of required public improvements excluding lot improvements on
individual lots.  If the subdivider does form or cause to be formed a special
district for the purposes identified in this section, the City shall not
release the subdivider from its obligating under any subdivision improvements
agreement nor shall the City release any security, in whole or in part, until
the special district has sold bonds or otherwise certifies to the City that it
has an absolute right to raise revenues sufficient to construct, maintain, and
warrant the quality of the required public improvements.
   (e)   Governmental Units.  Governmental units to which these contract and
security provisions apply may file, in lieu of the contract and security, a
certified resolution or ordinance from officers or agencies authorized to act
in their behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this Chapter.
   (f)   Failure to Complete Improvement.  For subdivisions for which no
subdivision improvement agreement has been executed and no security has been
posted, if the improvements are not completed within the period specified, the
sketch plat or preliminary plat approval shall be deemed to have expired.  In
those cases where a subdivision improvement agreement has been executed and
security has been posted and required public improvements have not been
installed within the terms of the agreement, the City may then:
      (1)    Declare the agreement to be in default and require that all
improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building development
at the time the agreement is declared to be in default;
      (2)    Suspend final subdivision plat approval until the improvements are
completed and record a document to that effect  for the purpose of public
notice;
      (3)    Obtain funds under the security  and complete improvements itself
or through a third party;
      (4)     Assign its right to receive funds under the security to any third
party, including a subsequent owner of the subdivision for which improvements
were not constructed, in whole or in part, in exchange for that subsequent
owner's promise to complete improvements in the subdivision;
      (5)    Exercise any other rights available under the law.
   (g)   Acceptance of Dedication Offers.  Acceptance of formal offers of
dedication of streets, public areas, easements, and parks shall be by ordinance
of the City Council.  The approval of a subdivision plat by the Planning
Commission, whether sketch, preliminary or final, shall not be deemed to
constitute or imply the acceptance by the City of any street, easement, or park
shown on the plat.  The Planning Commission may require the plat to be endorsed
with appropriate notes to this effect. 
(Ord. 2004-40.  Passed 5-24-04.)
   1367.03  INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   General Procedure and Fees.  The applicant shall pay to the
municipality an inspection deposit fee based on the estimated cost of
inspection, and where the improvements are completed prior to final plat
approval, the subdivision plat shall not be signed by the Chairman of Planning
Commission unless the inspection fee has been paid at the time of application. 
These fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the municipality and no
building permits or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees
are paid.  Where Planning Commission determines it to be appropriate, the
applicant shall provide testing and inspection services in a manner and source
approved by the City Engineer.  If the City Engineer finds upon inspection that
any one or more of the required improvements have not been constructed in
accordance with the construction standards and specifications of the City, the
applicant shall be responsible for properly completing the improvements.
   (b)   Release or Reduction of Security.
      (1)   Certificate of Satisfactory Completion.  The City will not accept
dedication of required improvements, nor release nor reduce the amount of any
security posted by the subdivider until the City Engineer has submitted a
certificate stating that all required improvements have been satisfactorily
completed and the following have been submitted:
         A.   A certification submitted by the applicant's engineer or surveyor
to the City Engineer, providing a detailed "as built" survey plat of the
subdivision, indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other information
required by the Planning Commission or City Engineer, and indicating that the
layout of the line and grade of all public improvements is in accordance with
construction plans for the subdivision; and,
         B.   If requested by the City Engineer, an AutoCad digital “as built”
file.
         C.   A title insurance policy furnished to and approved by the City
Law Director indicating that the improvements have been completed and are ready
for dedication to the City, and are free and clear of any and all liens and
encumbrances. 
            Upon such approval and recommendation by the Planning Commission,
City Engineer, and City Law Director, the Council shall thereafter accept the
improvements for dedication in accordance with established procedure.
      (2)   Reduction of Escrow Funds and Security.  If the security posted by
the subdivider was a cash escrow, the amount of that escrow shall be reduced
upon actual acceptance of the dedication of public improvements and then only
to the ratio that the cost of public improvement for which dedication was
accepted bears to the total cost of public improvements for the subdivider.  In
no event shall a cash escrow be reduced below twenty- five per cent (25%) of
the principal amount.  Funds held in the escrow account shall not be released
to the subdivider, in whole or in part, except upon express written
instructions of the City Law Director.  At the end of the maintenance and
warranty periods, all escrowed funds, if any, shall be released to the
subdivider.  If the security provided by the subdivider was a letter of credit,
the City Law Director shall execute waivers of the City's right to draw funds
under the credit upon actual acceptance of the dedication of public
improvements and then only to the ratio that the cost of the public improvement
for which dedication was accepted bears to the total cost of public
improvements for the subdivision.  In no event shall waivers be executed that
would reduce the security below twenty-five percent (25%) of its original
amount.
         (Ord. 2004-40.  Passed 5-24-04.)
   1367.05  ESCROW DEPOSITS FOR LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Acceptance of Escrow Funds.  Whenever, by reason of the season of the
year, any lot improvements required by the subdivision regulations cannot be
performed, the Building Commissioner may issue a certificate of occupancy,
provided there is no danger to the health, safety, or general welfare upon
accepting a cash escrow deposit in an amount to  be determined by the City
Engineer for the cost of the lot  improvements.  The subdivision improvement
agreement and security covering the lot improvements shall remain in full force
and effect.
   (b)   Procedures on Escrow Fund.  All required improvements for which escrow
monies have been accepted by the Building Commissioner at the time of issuance
of a certificate of occupancy shall be installed by  the subdivider within a
period of nine (9) months from the date of deposit  and issuance of the
certificate of occupancy.  If the improvements have not been properly installed
at the end of the time period, the Building Commissioner, or his agent, shall
give two (2) weeks written notice to the developer requiring it to install the
improvements, and if they are not then installed  properly, the Building
Commissioner may request the Council to  proceed to contract out the work for
the installation of required  improvements in a sum not to exceed the amount of
the escrow deposit.  At the time of the issuance of the certificate of
occupancy for which escrow monies are being deposited with the Building
Commissioner, the developer shall obtain and file with the Building
Commissioner prior to obtaining the certificate of occupancy a notarized
statement from the purchaser or purchasers of the premises authorizing the
Building Commissioner to install the improvements at the end of the nine month
period if the improvements have not been duly installed by the subdivider.
(Ord. 2004-40.  Passed 5-24-04.)
   1367.07  MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   The subdivider shall be required to maintain all required public
improvements on the individual subdivided lots and provide for snow removal on
streets and sidewalks, if required by the Planning Commission, until acceptance
of the improvements by Council.  If there are certificates of occupancy on a
street not dedicated to the City, the City may on twelve (12) hours notice plow
the street of effect emergency repairs and charge those costs to the developer,
following the acceptance of the dedication of any public improvement by the
City, the City, in its sole discretion require the subdivider to maintain the
improvement for a period of one (1) year from the date of acceptance. 
(Ord. 2004-40.  Passed 5-24-04.)
   1367.09  DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Deferral.  The Planning Commission may defer or waive at the time of
final approval, subject to recommendation by the City Engineer, the provision
of any or all public improvements as, in its judgement, are not requisite in
the interests of public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are
inappropriate because of the inadequacy or nonexistence of connecting
facilities.  Any determination to defer or waive the provision of any public
improvement must be made by majority vote on the record and the reasons for the
deferral or waiver also shall be expressly made on the record.
   (b)   Waiver.  Whenever if is deemed necessary by the Planning Commission to
defer the construction of any improvement required under these regulations
because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or nonexistent
connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the subdivider shall pay his share
of the costs of the future improvements to the City prior to signing of the
final subdivision plat by the Chairman of the Planning Commission, or the
developer may execute a separate  subdivision improvement agreement secured by
a letter of credit  guaranteeing completion of the deferred improvements upon
demand of the City.
(Ord. 2004-40.  Passed 5-24-04.)
   1367.11  ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS AND CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   (a)   Certificate of Occupancy.  When a subdivision improvement agreement
and security have been required for a subdivision, no certificate of occupancy
for any building shall be issued prior to the completion of the required public
improvements and the acceptance of the dedication of those improvements by the
City, as required in the Planning Commission's approval of the final
subdivision plat.
   (b)   Adequate Access.  The extent of street improvement shall be adequate
for vehicular access by the prospective occupant(s) and by police and fire
equipment prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit.  The developer shall,
at the time of the offer of dedication, submit monies in escrow to the City in
a sum determined by the City Engineer for the necessary final improvement of
the street.
   (c)   Building Permits.  No building permit shall be issued for the final
ten percent (10%) of the lots in the subdivision, or if ten percent (10%) be
less than two (2), for the final two (2) lots of a subdivision, until all
public improvements required by the Planning Commission for the subdivision 
have been fully completed and the City has accepted the developer's  offer(s)
to dedicate the improvements. 
(Ord. 2004-40.  Passed 5-24-04.)
   1367.13  CONSUMER'S PROTECTION LEGISLATION AND CONFLICTS  OF INTEREST
STATUTES.
   (a)   No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be granted or
issued if a developer or its authorized agent has violated any federal, state
of local law pertaining to (1) consumer protection, or (2) real estate land
sales, promotion, or practices; or (3) any applicable conflicts of interest
legislation with respect to the lot or parcel of land which is the subject of
the permit or certificate until a court of competent jurisdiction so orders.
   (b)   With respect to any lot or parcel of land described in the immediately
preceding section, if a building permit or certificate of occupancy has been

the ground and planted in such a manner that they will not be removed by frost.
      (6)   All monuments shall be properly set in the ground and approved by a
Registered Land Surveyor prior to the time the Planning Commission recommends
approval of the final plat.
   (f)   Character of the Land.  Land that the Planning Commission finds to be
unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, improper drainage,
steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility
easements, or other features that will reasonably be harmful to the safety,
health, and general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the
subdivision and/or surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or developed
unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the
Planning Commission, upon  recommendation of the City Engineer, to solve the
problems created by  the unsuitable land conditions.  Such land shall be set
aside for uses as shall not involve any danger to public health, safety, and
welfare. 
   (g)   Subdivision Name.  The proposed name of the subdivision shall not
duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other
subdivision in the area covered by these regulations.  The Planning Commission
shall have final authority to designate the name of the subdivision, which
shall be determined at sketch plat approval. 
(Ord. 2004-40.  Passed 5-24-04.)
   1369.03  LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Lot Arrangement.  The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in
securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the Zoning
Ordinance and Health Regulations and in providing driveway access to buildings
on the lots from an approved street.
   (b)   Lot Dimensions.  Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum
standards of the Zoning Ordinance.  Where lots are more than double the minimum
required area for the zoning district, the Planning Commission may require that
those lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of
future streets where they would be necessary to serve potential lots, all in
compliance with the Zoning Ordinance and these regulations. In general, side
lot lines shall be at right angles to street line  (or radial to curving street
lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot
plan.  Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of
buildings, observing the minimum front- yard setback from both streets.  Depth
and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial, or
industrial purpose shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and
loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated,
as established in the Zoning Ordinance, and to provide for on-site storm water
management unless an alternative plan is approved by the City Engineer.
   (c)   Lot Orientation.  The lot line common to the street right-of-way shall
be the front line.  All lots shall face the front line and a similar line
across the street.  Wherever feasible, lots shall be arranged so that the rear
line does not abut the side line of an adjacent lot.
   (d)   Double Frontage Lots and Access to Lots.
      (1)   Double Frontage Lots.  Double frontage and reversed frontage lots
shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential
development from traffic arterial or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation.
      (2)   Access from Major and Secondary Arterial.  Lots shall not, in
general, derive access exclusively from a major or secondary street.  Where
driveway access from a major or secondary street may be necessary for several
adjoining lots, the Planning Commission may require that such lots be served by
a combined access drive in order to limit possible traffic hazards on the
street.  Where possible, driveways should be designed and arranged so as to
avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on major and secondary arterial.
   (e)   Soil Preservation, Grading, and Seeding.  No certificate of occupancy
shall be issued until final grading has been completed in accordance with the
approved final subdivision plat and the lot recovered with soil with an average
depth of at least six (6) inches which shall contain no particles more than two
(2) inches in diameter over the entire area of the lot, except that portion
covered by buildings or included in streets, or where the grade has not been
changed or natural vegetation seriously damaged.  Topsoil shall not be removed
from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to
provide at least six (6) inches of cover on the lots and at least four (4)
inches of cover between the sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by
seeding or plantings. 
   (f)   Lot Drainage.  Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive
drainage away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be
coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area.  Drainage
shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from
each lot to adjacent lots.
   (g)   Lawn-Grass Seed and Sod.  Lawn-grass seed shall be sown at not less
than five (5) pounds to each one-thousand (1,000) square feet of land area.  In
the spring, the seed shall be sown between April 1 and May 30; and in the fall,
the seed shall be sown between August 1 and October 15.  The seed shall consist
of a maximum of twenty percent (20%) rye grass by weight and minimum of eighty
percent (80%) of permanent bluegrass and/or fescue grass by weight.  All seed
shall have been tested for germination with one (1) year of the date of
seeding, and the date of testing shall be on the label containing the seed
analysis.  All lots shall be seeded from the roadside edge of the unpaved
right- of-way back to a distance of twenty-five (25) feet behind the principal
residence on the lot.  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until re-
spreading of soil and seeding of lawn has been completed; except that between
October 16 and March 31, and between June 1 and August 31, the applicant shall
submit an agreement in writing signed by the developer and the property owner,
with a copy to the Building Commissioner, that re-spreading of soil and seeding
of lawn will be done during the immediate following planting season as set
forth in this section, and leave a cash escrow for performance in an amount
determined by the Building Commissioner.  Sod may be used to comply with any
requirement of seeding set forth herein.
   (h)   Erosion and Sediment Control.  All development must comply with
erosion and sediment control regulations of the City.  To this end, the
developer must provide such temporary and permanent control measures as are
appropriate.  Such measures may include the use of straw or hay bales, sediment
traps, sediment basins, silt fences, earth diversion dikes, check dams, storm
drain inlet protection, grasses and mulches, per construction plan details of
the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) in accordance with Standard
Construction Drawing MC-11, and standards set forth in "Rainwater and Land
Development", Ohio's Standards for Storm Water Management, Land Development and
Urban Stream Protection.  The implementation of soil erosion and sediment
control shall also conform to the requirements of the Lake County Soil and
Water Conservation District and Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA)
under the NPDES Permit Program for the discharge of storm water from
construction sites.  If conflicts exist regarding the standards for soil and
sediment control, the more restrictive shall apply.
   (i)   Debris and Water.  No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones,
soil, junk, rubbish, or other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in
any land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of the issuance
of a certificate of occupancy, and removal of those items and materials shall
be required prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy on a
subdivision.  No items and materials as described in the preceding sentence
shall be let or deposited in any area of the subdivision at the time of
expiration of any subdivision improvement agreement or dedication of public
improvements, whichever is sooner.
   (j)   Water bodies and Watercourses.  If a tract being subdivided contains a
water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute
the entire ownership of the water body among the adjacent lots.,  The Planning
Commission may approve an alternative plan whereby the ownership of and
responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so placed that it will
not become  a local government responsibility.  No more than twenty-five (25%)
of the minimum area of a lot required under the Zoning Ordinance may be
satisfied by land that is under water.  Where a watercourse separates the
buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provisions
shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure, of design
approved by the City Engineer.
   (k)   Subdivision Improvement Agreement and Security to Include Lot
Improvement.  The applicant shall enter into a separate subdivision improvement
agreement secured by a letter of credit or cash escrow to guarantee completion
of all lot improvement requirements including, but not limited to, soil
preservation, final grading, lot drainage, lawn-grass seeding, removal of
debris and waste, fencing, and all other lot improvements required by the
Planning Commission.  Whether or not a certificate of occupancy has been
issued, the local government may enforce the provisions of the subdivision
improvement agreement where the provisions of this section or any other
applicable law, ordinance, or regulation have not been met.
(Ord. 2004-40.  Passed 5-24-04.)
   1369.05  ROADS.
   (a)   Frontage on Improved Roads.  No subdivision shall be approved unless
the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an existing
street on the Official Map, or if there is no Official Map, unless such street
is:
      (1)   An existing state, country, or township highway; or
      (2)   A street shown upon a plat approved by the Planning Commission and
recorded in the County Recorder of Deeds' office.  Such street or highway must
be suitably improved as required by the highway rules, regulations,
specifications, or orders, or be secured by a performance bond required under
these subdivision regulations, with the width and right-of-way required by
these subdivision regulations or the Official Map Plan. 
   Wherever the area to be subdivided is to utilize existing road frontage, the
road shall be suitably improved as provided above.
   (b)   Level of Service.  The applicant may be required to provide a traffic
impact analysis for any development at the discretion of the City Engineer and
Planning Commission.  No development shall be approved if such development, at
full occupancy, will result in or increase traffic on an arterial or collector
so that the street does not function at a level of service of C or better.  The
applicant may propose and construct approved traffic mitigation measures to
provide adequate roadway capacity for the proposed development.
   (c)   Grading and Improvement Plan.  Roads shall be graded and improved and
conform to the local government construction standards and specifications and
shall be approved as to design and specifications by the City Engineer, in
accordance with the construction plans required to be submitted prior to final
plat approval.
   (d)   Topography and Arrangement.
      (1)   Roads shall be related appropriately to the topography.  Local
roads shall be curved wherever possible to avoid conformity of lot appearance. 
All streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many building sites as
possible at, or above, the grades of the streets.  Grades of streets shall
conform as closely as possible to the original topography.  A combination of
steep grades and curves shall be avoided.
   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed
system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-ways as established on the
Official Map and/or Master Plan.
      (2)   Minor or local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as
possible to the topography to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
      (3)   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Planning Commission such extension
is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future
development of adjacent tracks.
   (e)   Reserved.  Editor’s Note: This subsection is reserved for future
legislation.
   (f)   Blocks.
      (1)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of
lots of appropriate depths.  Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads, or waterways.
      (2)   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but
block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed one thousand five hundred
(1,500) feet or twelve (12) times the minimum lot width required in the zoning
district, nor be less than four hundred (400) feet in length.  Wherever
practicable, blocks along major arterial and collector streets shall be not
less than one thousand (1,000) feet in length.
      (3)   In long blocks the Planning Commission may require the reservation
of an easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities,
or pedestrian traffic.
      (4)   Pedestrian ways or crosswalks, not less than ten (10) feet wide and
paved with a Portland Cement concrete walk no less than five (5) feet wide, may
be required by the Planning Commission through the center of blocks more than
eight hundred (800) feet long where deemed essential to provide circulation or
access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or other
community facilities.  Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such
length and width as may be determined suitable by the Planning Commission for
prospective use.
   (g)   Access to Primary Arterial.  Plans for access to arterial roadways
shall be evaluated with reference to the State of Ohio, Department of
Transportation Access Management Manual.  Where a subdivision borders on or
contains an existing or proposed primary arterial, the Planning Commission will
encourage the use of various methods to minimize access points.  Such methods
may include the use of cross-easements, shared parking drive entries, etc. 
Planning Commission may also require that access to such streets be limited by
one of the following means:
      (1)   The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the primary arterial and
front onto a parallel local street; no access shall be provided from the
primary arterial, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land along the
rear property line of such lots.
      (2)   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered
from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the
rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the primary arterial.
      (3)   A marginal access or service road (separated from the primary
arterial by a planning or grass strip and having access at suitable points.).
   (h)   Road Names.  The Planning Commission shall approve all road names
shall be sufficiently different in sound and spelling from other road names in
the municipality so as not to cause confusion.  A road which is (or is planned
as) a continuation of an existing road shall bear the same name.
   (i)   Road Regulatory Signs.  The applicant shall deposit with the local
government at the time of final subdivision approval the sum of fifty dollars
($50.00) for each road sign required by the City Engineer at all road
intersections.  The City shall install all signs before issuance of
certificates of occupancy for any residence on the streets approved.  Street
name signs are to placed at all intersections within or abutting the
subdivision, the type and location of which to be approved by the City
Engineer.
   (j)   Street Lights.  Installation of streetlights shall be required in
accordance with design and specification standards approved by the City
Engineer.
   (k)   Reserve or Devil Strips.  The creation of reserve strips or devil
strips shall not be permitted adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as
to deny access from adjacent property to the street.
   (l)   Construction of Roads and Dead-End Roads.
      (1)   Construction of Roads. The arrangement of streets shall provide for
the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when the
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
protection, for efficient provision of utilities.  If the adjacent property is
undeveloped and the street must temporarily be a dead-end street, the right-
of-way shall be extended to the property line.  A temporary cul-de-sac shall be
provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the
subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert
to abuttors whenever the street is continued.  The Planning Commission may
limit the length of temporary dead- end streets in accordance with the design
standards of these regulations. 
      (2)   Dead-End Roads (Permanent). Where a road does not extend beyond the
boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the
Planning Commission for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall
normally not be nearer to such boundary than fifty (50) feet.  However, the
Planning Commission may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to
accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities.  A cul-de-
sac turn around shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead- end street in
accordance with construction standards and specifications approved by the City
Engineer.
   (m)   Design Standards.
      (1)   General.  In order to provide for roads of suitable location,
width, and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford
satisfactory access to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation, and
road- maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a
convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the
following design standards for roads are hereby required.
      (2)   Road Surfacing and Improvements.  After sewer and water utilities
have been installed by the developer, the developer shall construct curbs and
gutters and construct roadways to the widths prescribed in these regulations. 
All roads shall be portland cement concrete in accordance with specifications
as determined by the City Engineer to meet City and construction improvements 
Adequate provision shall be made for culverts, drains, and bridges.  All road
pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds,
and sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards and specifications
adopted by the Planning Commission, City Engineer, or Council and shall be
incorporated into the construction plans required to be submitted by the
developer for plat approval.
      (3)   Excess Right-of-Way.  Right-of-way widths in excess of the
standards designated in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to
topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. 
Such slopes shall not be in excess of three-to-one.
      (4)   Railroads and Limited Access Highways.  Railroad rights-of-way and
limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands shall be treated as follows:
         A.   In residential districts a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth
in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be
provided adjacent to the railroad right-or-way or limited access highway.  This
strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat: 
"This strip is reserved for screening.  The placement of structures on this
land is prohibited."
         B.   In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses
the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad
right-or-way shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance from the
railroad right-of-way to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial
sites. 
      (5)   Industrial Park Roadways.  Roadways in industrial parks and mixed
use districts which include manufacturing or light industrial uses shall be
constructed with pavement widths as described in Section
1169.05(b) and shall be constructed with a minimum 9” reinforced concrete
pavement meeting the ODOT specification.
      (6)   Intersections.
         A.   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles.  A proposed intersection of two (2) new streets at an
angle of less than seventy-five (75) degrees shall not be acceptable.  An
oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be
approximately at right angles for at least one hundred (100) feet therefrom. 
Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any one point unless
specifically approved by the Planning Commission.
         B.   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the
opposite side of such street.  Street jogs with center-line offsets of less
than 150 feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has
separated dual drives without median breaks at either intersection.  Where
streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall be continuous. 
Intersection of major streets shall be at least eight hundred (800) feet apart.
         C.   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two (2) local streets
shall be at least thirty (30) feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection
involving a collector street shall be at least thirty-five (35) feet; and,
minimum curb radius at an intersection involving an arterial street shall be at
least fifty (50) feet.  Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment
within a block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard
engineering practice to permit safe vehicular movement.
         D.   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical.  In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a two percent (2%) rate
at a distance of sixty (60) feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line
of the intersecting street.
         E.   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or
existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by
limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation
(including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to
the extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance. 
         F.   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall
be three percent (3%) or less.
      (7)   Pavement Widths.  The following minimum pavement widths shall be
used for all designs of streets and drives for public and private use. 
Pavement widths are measured from face of curb to face of curb when curb is
required.

    Commercial
      (8)   Bridges.  Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as
determined by the Planning Commission, shall be constructed at the full expense
of the applicant without reimbursement from the City.  The sharing expense for
the construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as
determined by the Planning Commission, will be fixed by special agreement
between the City Council and the applicant. 
   (n)   Road Dedications and Reservations.
      (1)   New Perimeter Streets.  Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets
      (2)   Widening and Realignment of Existing Roads.  Where a subdivision
borders an existing narrow road or when the Master Plan, Official Map, or
zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening a road
that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant
shall be required to improve and dedicate at its expense those areas for
widening or realignment of those roads.  Frontage roads and streets as
described above shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant at its own
expense to the full width as required by these subdivision regulations when the
applicant's development activities contribute to the need for the road
expansion. 
      (3)   Land reserved for any road purposes may not be counted in
satisfying yard or area requirements of the Zoning Ordinance whether the land
is to be dedicated to the municipality in fee simple or an easement is granted
to the City.    (Ord. 2004-40.  Passed 5-24-04.)
   1369.07  DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
   (a)   General Requirements.  The Planning Commission shall not recommend for
approval any plat of subdivision that does not make adequate provision for
storm and flood water runoff channels or basins.  The storm water drainage
system shall be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system.  Storm
sewers shall be designed by methods as approved by the City Engineer, and a
copy of design computations shall be submitted along with plans.  Inlets shall
be provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any
intersection, nor for a distance of more than 300 feet in the gutter.  When
calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further
allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used to
intercept flow at that point.  Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown
for each and every lot and block. 
   (b)   Nature of Storm Water Facilities.
      (1)   Location.  The applicant may be required by the Planning Commission
to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist
either previously to, or as a result of the subdivision.
      (2)   Accessibility to Public Storm Sewers. 
         A.   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable
distance, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm waters,
subject to the specifications of the City Engineer. 
         B.   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided
eventually, as determined by the City Engineer and the Planning Commission, the
developer shall make arrangements for future storm water disposal by a public
utility system at the time the plat receives final approval. 
      (3)   Accommodation of Upstream Drainage Areas.  A culvert or other
drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential
runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision.  The City Engineer shall determine the necessary size of the
facility, based on the provisions of the construction standards and
specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.
      (4)   Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas.  The City Engineer shall also
study the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities
outside the area of the subdivision.  Local government drainage studies
together with such other studies as shall be appropriate, shall serve as a
guide to needed improvements.  Where it is anticipated that the additional
runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing
downstream drainage facility, the Planning Commission may withhold approval of
the subdivision until provision has been made for the expansion of the existing
downstream drainage facility.  No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate
drainage will be provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility. 
      (5)   Areas of Poor Drainage.  Wherever a plat is submitted for an area
that is subject to flooding, the Planning Commission may approve such
subdivision provided that the applicant fills the affected area of the
subdivision to an elevation sufficient to place the elevation of streets and
lots at a minimum of twelve (12) inches above the elevation of the one hundred
(100) year floodplain, as determined by the City Engineer.  The plat of the
subdivision shall provide for an overflow zone along the bank of any stream or
watercourse, in a width that shall be sufficient in times of high water to
contain or move the water, and no fill shall be placed in the overflow zone nor
shall any structure be erected or placed in the overflow zone.  The boundaries
of the overflow zone shall be subject to approval by the City Engineer.  The
Planning Commission may deny subdivision approval for areas of extremely poor
drainage.
      (6)   Floodplain Areas.  The Planning Commission may, when it deems it
necessary for the health, safety, or welfare of the present and future
population of the area and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage,
and sanitary facilities, prohibit the subdivision of any portion of the
property that lies within the floodplain of any stream or drainage course. 
These floodplain areas shall be preserved from any and all destruction or
damage resulting from clearing, grading, or dumping of earth, waste material,
or stumps, except at the discretion of the Planning Commission.
   (c)   Dedication of Drainage Easements.
      (1)   General Requirements.  When a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement
or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such
watercourse, and of such width and construction as will be adequate for the
purpose.  Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by
an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential
volume of flow.
      (2)   Drainage Easements. 
         A.   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road right-of- way,
perpetual, unobstructed easements at least fifteen (15) feet in width for
drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road lines
and with satisfactory access to the road.  Easements shall be indicated on the
plat.  Drainage easements shall extend from the road to a natural watercourse
or to other drainage facilities.
         B.   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat. 
         C.   The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by a drainage or
conservation easement, land on both sides of existing watercourses to a

section does not equal the minimum area required to be reserved, or where the
subdivision may be served by an existing park or recreation facility, the
Planning Commission shall require that the applicant deposit with Council a
cash payment in lieu of land reservation.  Such deposit shall be placed in a
Neighborhood Park and Recreation  Improvement Fund to be established by the
Council.  The deposit shall be used by the City for improvement of a
neighborhood park, playground, or recreation area including the acquisition of
property.  The deposit must be used for facilities that actually will be
available to and benefit the persons in the subdivision for which payment was
made and be located in the general neighborhood of subdivision.  The Planning
Commission shall determine the amount to be deposited based on two hundred
dollars ($200.00) multiplied by the number of times that the total number of
dwelling units in the subdivision, less a credit for the amount of any land
actually reserved for recreation purposes.

upon recommendation of the City Engineer, shall grant a waiver. 
      (2)   New trees to be provided pursuant to these regulations shall be
approved by the City Engineer and shall be planted in accordance with the
recommendations of the City Engineer.  The trees shall have a minimum trunk
diameter (measured twelve [12] inches above ground level) of not less than two

shade trees, acceptable to the City Engineer and to the Planning Commission,
shall be planted.
      (3)   Shade Tree Easement and Dedication.  The preliminary plat and final
plat shall reserve an easement authorizing the local government to plant shade
trees with five (5) feet of the required right-of-way of the local government. 
No street shall be accepted for dedication until the City Engineer shall inform
the Planning Commission and Council that compliance, where necessary, has been
made with these regulations.
         (Ord. 2004-40.  Passed 5-24-04.)

dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated.
      (2)   Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate
the type of volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
      (3)   Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to
street, curb, gutter, and sidewalk design and construction.
      (4)   Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and storm water
drainage.

CHAPTER 1371
Plat Vacation
1371.01   Plat vacation.
   1371.01  PLAT VACATION.
   (a)   Owner Initiated Plat Vacation.  The owner or owners of lots in any
approved subdivision, including the developer, may petition the Planning
Commission to vacate the plat with respect to their properties.  The petition
shall be filed on forms provided by the Building Commissioner.  One (1) copy
shall be referred to the Planning Commission.
      (1)   Notice and Hearing.  The Planning Commission shall publish notice
in a local newspaper of general circulation and provide personal notice of the
petition for vacation to all owners of property within the affected subdivision
and shall state in the notice the time and place for a public hearing on the
vacation petition.  The public hearing shall be no sooner than thirty (30) days
and no later than forty-five (45) days after the published and personal notice.
      (2)   Criteria.  The Planning Commission shall approve the petition for
vacation on such terms and conditions as are reasonable to protect public
health, safety, and welfare; but in no event may the Planning Commission
approve a petition for vacation if it will materially injure the rights of any
non- consenting property owner or any public rights in public improvements
unless expressly agreed to by City Council. 
      (3)   Recordation of Revised Plat.  Upon approval of any petition for
vacation, the Planning Commission shall direct the petitioners to prepare a
Revised Final Subdivision  Plat in accordance with these regulations.  The
Revised Final Subdivision Plat may be recorded only after having been signed by
the Chairman of the Planning Commission and the Law Director.
      (4)   Developer Initiated Vacation.  When the developer of the
subdivision, or its successor, owns all of the lots in the subdivision, the
Developer or successor may petition for vacation of the subdivision plat and
the petition may be approved, conditionally approved, or disapproved at a
regular public meeting of the Planning Commission subject to criteria specified
in this Chapter.  The petition shall be made on forms provided by the Building
Commissioner at least thirty (30) days prior to a regular Planning Commission
public meeting and the Commission shall refer one (1) copy of the petition to
City Council.  Regardless of the Planning Commission's action on the petition,
the developer or its successor will have no right to a refund of any monies,
fees, or charges paid to the municipality nor to the return of any property or
consideration dedicated or delivered to the municipality except as may have
previously been agreed to by the Planning Commission, City Council, and the
developer. 
   (b)   Government Initiated Plat Vacation.
      (1)   General Conditions.  The Planning Commission, on its motions, may
vacate the plat of an approved subdivision when:
         A.   No lots within the approved subdivision have been sold within
five (5) years from the date that the plat was signed by the Chairman of the
Planning Commission;
         B.   The developer has breached a subdivision improvement agreement
and the municipality is unable to obtain funds with which to complete
construction of public improvements, except that the vacation shall apply only
to lots owned by the developer or its successor;
         C.   The plat has been of record for more than five (5) years and the
Planning Commission determines that the further sale of lots within the
subdivision presents a threat to public health, safety and welfare, except that
the vacation shall apply only to lots owned by the developer not its
successor. 
      (2)   Procedure.  Upon any motion of the Planning Commission to vacate
the plat of any previously approved subdivision, in whole or in part, the
Commission shall publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation, and
provide personal notice to all property owners within the subdivision and shall
also provide notice to City Council.  The notice shall state the time and place
for a public hearing on the motion to vacate the subdivision plat.  The public
hearing shall be no sooner than thirty (30) and no later than forty-five (45)
days from the date of the published and personal notice.  The Planning
Commission shall approve the resolution effecting the vacation only if the
criteria in Section
1371.01(a)(2) are satisfied.
      (3)   Recordation of Notice.  If the Planning Commission adopts a
resolution vacating a plat in whole, it shall record a copy of the resolution
in the Clerk and Recorder's Office of Lake County.  If the Planning Commission
adopts a resolution vacating a plat in part, it shall record a copy of the
resolution as described above and cause a revised Final Subdivision Plat to be
recorded which shows that portion of the original subdivision plat that has
been vacated and that portion that has not been vacated.

within five hundred (500) feet of the well and tank sites shall be provided.
   (e)   No well may be drilled, or tank batteries located, in any location
where emergency vehicles, such as fire trucks and ambulances, cannot obtain
reasonable access to the site.
   (f)   No well shall be allowed within any distance of any structure or
facility (e.g., playground) that, based on the specific facts and circumstances

the Building Commissioner, creates a threat to the health, safety and welfare
of said structure or facilities or occupants or users thereof.
   (g)   Proof of insurance shall be filed with the Building Commissioner prior
to the commencement of drilling.  The proof of insurance must establish that
the Permit Holder is insured by a solvent insurer, is licensed to do business

head and tank locations, for both summer and winter conditions from all
neighbors and from all public and private rights-of- way while such facilities
are on the subject premises for the life of the well.  The Fire Chief and
Building Commissioner shall determine the sufficiency of the screening and may
order the Permit Holder to plant more vegetation.

operations may occur twenty-four (24) hours per day until the permitted depth
is reached. This applies only to the drilling operations and does not apply to
any site preparation, restoration, or other associated work.
   (p)   It shall be a violation of this section for a Permit Holder to violate
the terms and conditions of the State-issued permit.
