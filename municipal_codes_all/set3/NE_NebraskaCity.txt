PREFACE 
This volume contains the Code of Ordinances of the City of Nebraska City, Nebraska. The Code is a revision and codification of all ordinances of a general and permanent nature that were deemed advisable to be included. 
This Code is an entirely new codification and, as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, supersedes all general and permanent ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. Only ordinances of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole are included herein. Special ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the City, rather than all of them, relating to special purposes, such as ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, etc., are not included. For a more specific enumeration of the types of ordinances which are not included, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
ORGANIZATION OF CODE PROVISIONS 
As will be noted, the chapters have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Attention is also directed to the appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant provisions of general state law. 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the eighth section of Chapter 9 is 9-8. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter. New sections can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. Thus, if new material, consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-4 and 4-5 is to be added, the new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2 and 4-4.3. Sections have been reserved at the end of articles and divisions to provide for future expansion. 
New chapters may be included by the addition of a fractional number after the chapter number. As an example, if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12 1/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way, or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and in case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
The source of each section is included in the history note in parentheses at the end thereof. 
LOOSELEAF SUPPLEMENT SERVICE 
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is directed is the innovation of the looseleaf form of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this new looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such subsequent amendment, when incorporated into this Code, will be cited as a part thereof as provided in Section 4 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them, and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for purposes of historical reference. 
INDEX 
The index to the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.

(1)  No employee in the civil service who shall have been permanently appointed or inducted into civil service shall be removed, suspended, demoted or discharged except for cause and then only upon the written accusation of the police or fire chief, mayor or any citizen or taxpayer. 
(2)  The written accusation shall set forth the alleged misconduct, charges or grounds for investigation against the employee. The written accusation shall be filed by the complainant with the secretary of the commission who shall cause a copy of such written accusation to be delivered, within seventy-two (72) hours after the filing, (a) to the police or fire chief, (b) to the mayor, and (c) to the employee personally or by certified mail, addressed to the employee at the residence address of the employee shown in the personnel records. The secretary of the commission shall cause a return showing such delivery or mailing to be executed and filed in the secretary's office. 
(3)  The police or fire chief shall have the authority to immediately suspend, with pay, an employee against whom such written accusation has been filed, pending the confirmation of the suspension, or a decision of the mayor to reinstate the employee, remove, demote, discharge or suspend the employee, with or without pay. 
(4)  Prior to the decision of the mayor to reinstate the employee or remove, demote, discharge or suspend the employee, with or without pay, the police or fire chief shall, within a reasonable period of time, investigate the alleged misconduct, charges or grounds against the employee and explain the basis of the employer's evidence to the employee and provide the employee an opportunity to present his or her version of the circumstances which resulted in the filing of the written accusation.

The secretary of the commission shall cause a return showing such delivery or mailing to be executed and filed in the secretary's office. In the event that a police or fire chief is being disciplined, the mayor shall follow the same procedures as are followed by the police or fire chief in disciplining employees under this article. Upon completion of this procedure, within a reasonable period of time the police or fire chief shall recommend in writing to the mayor that the alleged misconduct, charges or grounds, set forth in the written accusation be deemed: 
(1)  To be without merit; 
(2)  To not warrant disciplinary action; 
(3)  To warrant disciplinary action less severe than removal, demotion, discharge or suspension, with or without pay, such as an oral or written reprimand; or 
(4)  To warrant removal, demotion, discharge or suspension, with or without pay. 
(5)  Within four (4) calendar days after receiving the written recommendation of the police or fire chief, the mayor shall decide to accept the recommendation of the police or fire chief or shall decide that the alleged misconduct, charges or grounds for investigation against the employee set forth in the written accusation be deemed:

(3)  To warrant disciplinary action less severe than removal, demotion, discharge or suspension, with or without pay, such as an oral or written reprimand; or 
(4)  To warrant removal, demotion, discharge or suspension, with or without pay. The mayor shall file a copy of his or her decision within four (4) calendar days after receiving the written recommendation of the police or fire chief with the secretary of the commission, who shall cause a copy of such decision to be delivered within seventy-two (72) hours after filing, (a) to the police or fire chief, (b) to the employee personally or by certified mail, addressed to the employee at the residence address of the employee shown in the personnel records. The secretary of the commission shall cause a return showing such delivery or mailing to be executed and filed in the secretary's office. 
(6)  Any employee so removed, suspended, demoted or discharged may, within ten (10) calendar days after receiving written notice of the mayor's decision, file a written demand for an investigation and public hearing with the secretary of the commission and simultaneously send a copy of the request to the mayor. The failure to file such a request with the secretary of the commission within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of notice of the action by the mayor shall constitute a waiver of the employee's right to review by the civil service commission, and the mayor's decision shall become final. 
(7)  Within five (5) calendar days of receipt of the employee's notice of appeal, the mayor shall cause to be mailed or delivered the following notice to the employee and secretary of the civil service commission:

b.  The names of the witnesses who will be called on behalf of the mayor and a general statement of the nature of their testimony; and

a.  A response to the statement of the charge(s); 
b.  The names of the witnesses who will be called on behalf of the employee and a general statement of the nature of their testimony; and 
c.  Copies of the documents to be introduced. 
(9)  Upon receipt of a written demand, the commission shall conduct an investigation. The commission may be represented in such investigation and public hearing by the city attorney, if authorized by the mayor and council. If the city attorney does not represent the commission, the commission may be represented by special counsel appointed by the commission for any such investigation and hearing. The investigation shall consist solely of a review of the written submissions of the mayor and employee to determine whether any individuals or documents should be subpoenaed by the commission for the subsequent public hearing before the commission, ultimately to determine whether the mayor acted in good faith for cause. Good faith for cause shall mean that the action was not arbitrary or capricious and was not made for political or religious reasons. 
(10)  The commission shall schedule a public hearing no less than ten (10) nor more than twenty (20) calendar days from the date of filing of the employee's written demand for an investigation. The commission shall notify the mayor and employee in writing at least five (5) calendar days prior to the date of the hearing of the date, time and place of hearing. 
(11)  The mayor shall be permitted to appear in person and by counsel and to present his or her case. The mayor may present evidence by testimony and documents and shall be permitted to cross-examine the employee's witnesses. At the hearing, the employee shall be permitted to appear in person and by counsel and to present his or her defense. The employee may present evidence by testimony and documents and shall be permitted to cross-examine the witnesses called by the mayor.

No officer shall be interested in any contract to perform any work for, or furnish any material to, any contractor or subcontractor in conjunction with a contract between such contractor or subcontractor and the city. The existence of such an interest in any contract renders the contract voidable by decree of a court of competent jurisdiction as to any person who entered into the contract or took assignment thereof with actual knowledge of the prohibited conflict. An action to have a contract declared void under this section may be brought by the city or by any resident thereof, and must be brought within one (1) year after the contract is signed or assigned. Any such decree may provide for the reimbursement of any person for the reasonable value of all money, goods, material, labor, or services furnished under the contract, to the extent that the city has benefited thereby.

(b)  The provisions in subsection (a) of this section shall not apply if the interested officer: 
(1)  Reveals in writing to the governmental body responsible for approving the contract the nature and extent of his or her interest, prior to official consideration of the contract; 
(2)  Does not participate in the consideration or discussion of the contract, other than to reveal his or her interests; 
(3)  Does not attempt to influence other officers or employees in any way relating to the contract; 
(4)  Does not vote on the matter of granting the contract; 
(5)  Removes himself or herself during the consideration of, discussion of, vote on the contract; and 
(6)  Does not act, directly or indirectly, for the city as to inspection, operation, administration, or performance under the contract in which he or she has an interest. 
(c)  The receiving of deposits, cashing of checks, and buying and selling of warrants and bonds of indebtedness of the city by a financial institution shall not be considered a contract under the provisions of this section. The ownership of less than one (1) per cent of the outstanding shares of a corporation shall not constitute an interest within the meaning of this section. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any contract entered into with an interested officer shall be subject to applicable competitive bidding requirements and shall represent the best alternative available to the city in terms of, but not limited to, price and quality of the property or services.

(a)  The city clerk shall maintain, separately from other records, a ledger containing the information listed in subsections (1) to (5) of this section about every contract entered into by the city in which an officer has an interest for which disclosure is made as provided in this section. Any officer who has an interest in a contract entered into with the city he or she serves, shall provide the clerk with the: 
(1)  Names of the contracting parties; 
(2)  Nature of the interest of the officer in question; 
(3)  Date that the contract was approved by the city;

Thereafter, the interested officer shall file a revision to the statement whenever a payment is made on the account. Such revision shall specify the date and amount of the payment. 
(Ord. No. 1875-83, § 5, 10-17-83)  
Sec. 2-395. - Authority of city to prohibit certain contracts.

ARTICLE V. - VACANT BUILDINGS[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 3025-18, § 1, adopted January 7, 2019, amended article V, in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article V, §§ 9-91—9-100, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2769, adopted August 17, 2009; Ord. No. 2869-12, adopted February 20, 2012 and Ord. No. 2902-13, adopted April 1, 2013. 
 
Sec. 9-91. - Purpose and findings. 
The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety and welfare of Nebraska City by establishing a program for identification and registration of vacant downtown buildings, collect fees to compensate for the public costs of such vacant properties, plan for the rehabilitation of vacant downtown properties, and encourage the occupancy of vacant downtown properties. 
The council finds and declares: 
(1)  Vacant properties have the potential to create a host of problems for the community, including a propensity to foster criminal activity, create public health problems, and otherwise diminish quality of life; 
(2)  Vacant properties have the potential to reduce the value of area properties, increase the risk of property damage through arson and vandalism, and discourage neighborhood stability; 
(3)  Vacant properties represent unrealized economic growth in Nebraska City, particularly in the downtown district; 
(4)  Vacant property registrations would allow the city to discourage property vacancy, maintain unoccupied buildings, provide a data base of vacant properties and their owners, and assess fees for the increased public costs associated with vacant properties; 
(5)  Fees imposed under a vacant property registration ordinance have the potential to benefit the owners of vacant properties by helping to finance additional government services to protect the value and security of such properties; and 
(6)  Enactment of a vacant property registration ordinance is a proper exercise of governmental authority to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of community residents and a valid regulatory scheme. 
(Ord. No. 3025-18, § 1, 1-7-19)  
Sec. 9-92. - Definitions. 
For purposes of this article: 
Downtown district or downtown means the area of Nebraska City consisting of both sides of Central Avenue extending from 4th Street to 16th Street; both sides of 1st Avenue and both sides of 1st Corso from 4th Street to 16th Street; and all north-south streets contained therein. 
Evidence of vacancy means any condition or circumstance that on its own or in combination with other conditions or circumstances would lead a reasonable person to believe that a residential building or commercial building is vacant. Such conditions or circumstances may include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Overgrown or dead vegetation, including grass, shrubbery, and other plantings; 
(2)  An accumulation of abandoned personal property, trash, or other waste; 
(3)  Visible deterioration or lack of maintenance of any building or structure on the property; 
(4)  Graffiti or other defacement of any building or structure on the property; or 
(5)  Any other condition or circumstance reasonably indicating that the property is not lawfully occupied for residential purposes or being used for the operation of a lawful business. 
Owner means the person or persons shown to be the owner or owners of record on the records of the register of deeds; 
Vacant means that a building exhibits evidence of vacancy. Storage does not constitute occupancy unless authorized by the zoning ordinance of the city. 
(Ord. No. 3025-18, § 1, 1-7-19)  
Sec. 9-93. - Vacant building registration. 
The city shall create a vacant property registration data base, and the city building inspector is designated as program administrator. The program administrator may utilize additional city employees as may be necessary to administer the program with the approval of the employee's department head, direct supervisor, and commissioner overseeing the employee's department. 
The owner of a vacant building in the downtown district shall register the building with city hall if the property has been vacant for one hundred eighty (180) days or longer. A vacant property registration form shall be in either paper or electronic form, and the following information shall be required: 
(1)  The name, street address, mailing address, telephone number, and, if applicable, the facsimile number and email address of the property owner and his or her agent; 
(2)  The street address and parcel identification number of the vacant property; 
(3)  The transfer date of the instrument conveying the property to the owner; 
(4)  The date on which the property became vacant; and 
(5)  A plan for occupancy of the property. 
In developing a plan for occupancy of the property, the owner should work with city staff to determine what programs and resources might be available to help fund improvements to the property, such as exploring the City of Nebraska City Economic Development Plan and Nebraska City Growth Fund financing opportunities. 
The owner shall notify the city of any changes in information supplied as part of the vacant building registration within thirty (30) days of the change. Removal of the property from the vacant property registration database shall occur when the property is no longer vacant.  
Sec. 9-94. - Vacant building fees. 
The vacant property registration fee shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) due and payable one hundred eighty (180) days after initial registration of the vacant property pursuant to this section or three hundred sixty (360) days after the property becomes vacant, whichever is sooner. 
Supplemental registration fees at intervals every six (6) months thereafter shall be due for as long as the property remains on the vacant property registration data base. The supplemental registration fees shall be not more than double the previous fee amount, with a maximum supplemental registration fee of ten (10) times the initial registration fee amount. Subject to these limitations, the supplemental registration fees may be adopted by resolution of the city council. 
A subsequent owner or owners of property subject to this article will assume the obligations of the previous owner or owners. 
Registration fees are refundable to the payor for the year preceding the date on which the property is no longer vacant.

The burden of proving this exemption shall be on the owner and the standard of proof shall be by clear and convincing evidence.

(3)  A vacant property which is subject to on-going divorce, probate, or estate proceedings; and

(Ord. No. 3025-18, § 1, 1-7-19)  
Sec. 9-96. - Inspections. 
The program administrator or his or her designee may inspect the interior and exterior of the vacant property upon registration and at one-year intervals thereafter for so long as the property remains on the vacant property registration database. A report will be provided to the owner noting code deficiencies, if any. The owner will be required to make necessary repairs based upon a reasonable timetable to allow the property to become occupied. Follow-up inspections will be made by the city building inspector to ensure that repairs have been timely completed. 
(Ord. No. 3025-18, § 1, 1-7-19)  
Sec. 9-97. - Emergency repairs.

(Ord. No. 3025-18, § 1, 1-7-19)  
Sec. 9-98. - Costs of emergency repairs, hearing and appeal. 
(a)  Upon receiving the notice to repair the building, the owner of the building, within the time stipulated, may in writing to the city clerk-treasurer request a hearing before the board of building appeals to present reasons why the building should not be repaired. The board of appeals shall grant such hearing within ten (10) days from the date of receiving the request. 
(b)  A written notice of the board of building appeals decision following the hearing shall be sent to the property owner by certified mail. If the board of building appeals rejects the appeal, the owner shall have ten (10) days from the sending of the decision to begin repair. If after the ten-day period the owner has not begun work, the city shall proceed to cause such work to be done; provided, the property owner may appeal such decision to the appropriate court for adjudication during which proceedings the decision of the city shall by stayed. 
(c)  In case the owner of any building or structure shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with notice by or on behalf of the city to repair or rehabilitate a building or structure which is unsafe, the city may proceed with the work specified in the notice to the property owner. 
(d)  A statement of the cost of such work, including the cost of advertising and publishing of notices, shall be transmitted to the city council, which is authorized to levy the costs as a special assessment against the land. Such special assessment shall be a lien on the real estate and shall be collected in the manner provided for special assessments. 
(Ord. No. 3025-18, § 1, 1-7-19)  
Sec. 9-99. - Penalties. 
Any person violating any provision of this article or providing false information to the city shall be fined for failure to comply in an amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00), with each day of violation being a separate offense.

The lien created under this section shall be subordinate to all liens on the applicable property recorded prior to the time the notice of such lien under this section is recorded. 
(Ord. No. 3025-18, § 1, 1-7-19)  
Sec. 9-100. - Alternative procedures.

Upon approval of the appeal recognizance the county judge shall forthwith make a transcript of the proceedings before him and shall deliver such transcript with all the files and the recognizance in the case to the clerk of the district court, who shall thereupon enter the cause upon the criminal appearance docket of the court, together with the date of filing the transcript and recognizance, the date and amount of the recognizance, the names of the sureties, and the amount of costs taxed in the county court, whereupon the case shall be considered as of record in such court and shall be proceeded upon as provided by law in cases of appeals in criminal cases from the county courts; provided, that in an appeal involving a complaint filed for violation of a municipal ordinance, the case shall be tried by the court without a jury.

In any case where the defendant establishes to the satisfaction of the county judge that he is unable to make immediate payment of such fine and costs by reason of indigency, the county judge may modify the judgment by ordering such fine and costs may be paid in installments of such amounts and at such times as may be reasonable and proper, upon default in which the defendant may be committed as above provided, or the county judge may enter such other and further order as may be reasonable and proper.

is consistent in all respects with the approved preliminary plan and any conditions of approval
thereof. If the detailed site plan and related restrictive covenant, owner's association or other
entity and financial capability information is found to be inconsistent with such approved
preliminary plan, it shall be returned to the applicant for modification to remove any
inconsistencies found by the commission. If such inconsistencies are not removed, the
commission shall not approve a detailed site plan and shall not allow the planned unit
development to proceed.
8. In approving any detailed site plan, the commission may attach any condition, including the
reservation of land for any reasonable public purpose, to assure that the proposed planned

Section 419. - Floodplain Hazard Overlay District
419.1.1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
The Legislature of the State of Nebraska has delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the public health,
safety, general welfare, and property of the people of the state. The Legislature, in
Nebraska Revised Statutes Sections 31-1001 to 31-1023 (as amended), has further
assigned the responsibility to adopt, administer, and enforce floodplain management
regulations to the county, city, or village with zoning jurisdiction over the flood prone area.
Therefore, the City Council of the City of Nebraska City, Nebraska ordains as follows:
419.1.2 FINDINGS OF FACT
A. Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 36
The flood hazard areas of the City of Nebraska City, Nebraska are subject to inundation
that may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
B. General Causes of the Flood Losses
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities as well as the occupancy of flood
hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others that are inadequately
elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
C. Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards
This ordinance uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards, which consists of a
series of interrelated steps:
i. Selection of a regulatory flood based upon engineering calculations that allows
a consideration of such flood factors as the expected frequency of occurrence,
the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood is selected for
this ordinance and is representative of large floods that are reasonably
characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject
to this ordinance. The base flood is in the general order of a flood that could be
expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one year, as
delineated on the FEMA Flood Insurance Study dated February 18, 2011, and
other associated materials, as amended.
419.1.3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare and to minimize those losses described in Section 1.2 by applying the provisions
of this ordinance to:
A. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of
flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities.
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that service such
uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction.
C. Reduce financial burdens from flood damage borne by the community, its
governmental units, its residents, and its businesses by preventing excessive and unsafe
development in areas subject to flooding.
D. Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase
flood insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program.
419.1.4 ADHERENCE TO REGULATIONS
The regulations of this ordinance are in compliance with the National Flood Insurance
Program Regulations as published in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations and the
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 37
Nebraska Minimum Standards for Floodplain Management Programs as published in the
Nebraska Administrative Code Title 455, Chapter 1.
SECTION 419.2. GENERAL PROVISIONS
419.2.1 LANDS TO WHICH ORDINANCE APPLIES
This ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdictions of the City of Nebraska City
identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) panels shown and listed on FIRM
INDEX 31131CIND0B, for the community of Nebraska City #310392, dated February 18,
2011, as Zones A, A1-30, AE, AO, or AH and within all Zoning Districts established in
Section 3.0 of this ordinance (including floodways currently existing or hereafter created).
In all areas covered by this ordinance, no development shall be allowed except upon the
issuance of a floodplain development permit to develop, granted by the floodplain
administrator or the governing body under such safeguards and restrictions as the City
Council or its designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and
maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community and
where specifically noted in Sections 4.0 and 5.0.
419.2.2 RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
The boundaries of the floodway and the flood fringe overlay districts shall be determined
by scaling distances on the official zoning map of on the effective Flood Insurance Rate
Map. Where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the
districts as shown on the official zoning map, for example where there appears to be a
conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the floodplain
administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. In such cases where the
interpretation is contested, the Board of Adjustment will resolve the dispute. The
regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating
the district boundary on the land. The person contesting the location of the district
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Board of
Adjustment and to submit their own technical evidence, if so desired.
419.2.3 COMPLIANCE
Within identified special flood hazard areas of this community, no development shall be
located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms
of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
419.2.4 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
This ordinance does not intend to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existent easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance imposes greater
restrictions, the provision of this ordinance shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
419.2.5 INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance shall be held to be
minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and
shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 38
419.2.6 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger
floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or
natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This
ordinance does not imply that areas outside floodway and flood fringe district boundaries
or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damage.
This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of Nebraska City or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this
ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
419.2.7 SEVERABILITY
If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional
or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be
affected thereby.
SECTION 419.3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS
Along watercourses where a floodway has been established, the mapped floodplain
areas are hereby divided into the two following districts: a floodway overlay district (FW)
and a flood fringe overlay district (FF) as identified in the Flood Insurance Study dated
February 18, 2011, and on accompanying FIRM panels as established in Section 2.1.
The flood fringe overlay district shall correspond to flood zones A, AE, A1-30, AH, AO,
AR, A99, and floodway areas in Zone AE that are identified on FIRM panels. The
floodway overlay district shall correspond to the floodway areas in Zone AE that are
identified on the FIRM panels. Within these districts, all uses not meeting the standards
of this ordinance and those standards of the underlying zoning district shall be prohibited.

Start of Construction means the date the floodplain development permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. “Start of construction” also includes
substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement
of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or
the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation
of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property
of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the

heirs or devisees, transfer of ownership, or building or lot development.
Substantial Damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cumulative cost of restoring the structure to its before-damage condition would equal or exceed
50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement
of a structure, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of
the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been
identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure
safe living conditions, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."
Variance is a grant of relief to an applicant from the requirements of this ordinance that allows
construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where specific enforcement
would result in unnecessary hardship.
Violation means a failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the
community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the
Elevation Certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this
ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Section 420. - AHO Airport Hazard Overlay District.
420.01. Intent: This district is established as an overlay district for application over any
primary zoning district in order to protect the safe use, public investment, and utility of
public airports and their Airport Hazard Area, within the city of Nebraska City, NE and its
extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction, by limiting the location and height of structures within the
operation, approach, transition and turning zones around airports which are licensed by
the Nebraska Department of Aeronautics, as designated on the Airport Zoning Map
prepared by the Nebraska Department of Aeronautics for the Nebraska City Municipal
Airport (Dwg. No. ZN-TQE-15 dated January 13, 2015)
420.01 Definitions
Airport means an area of land or water that is used or intended to be used for the landing and
takeoff of aircraft and includes any related buildings and facilities. Airport includes only public use
airports with state or federally approved airport layout plans and military airports with
military service-approved military layout plans.
Airport Hazard means any structure or tree or use of land which obstructs the airspace required
for the flight of aircraft in landing or taking off at an airport or is otherwise hazardous to such
landing or taking off of aircraft; or penetrates any approach, operation, transition, or turning
zone.
Airport Hazard Area means any area of land or water upon which an airport hazard might be
established if not prevented as provided in the Nebraska Airport Zoning Act, but such area shall
not extend in any direction a distance in excess of the limits provided for approach, operation,
transition, and turning zones.
Airport Layout Plan means a scaled drawing of existing and proposed land, buildings, and
facilities necessary for the operation and development of an airport prepared in accordance with
state rules and regulations and federal regulations and guidelines.

May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 58
Instrument Runway means an existing runway with precision or nonprecision instrument
approaches as developed and published by the Federal Aviation Administration or an existing or
proposed runway with future precision or non-precision instrument approaches reflected on the
airport layout plan. After the effective date of this zoning regulation, an airport shall not
designate an existing or proposed runway as an instrument runway if the runway was not
previously designated as such without the approval of the airport's governing body after a public
bearing on such designation.
Operation Zone means a zone that is longitudinally centered on each existing or proposed
runway.
Person means any individual, firm, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, company,
association, joint-stock association, or body politic and includes any trustee, receiver, assignee,

Aviation Administration.
Runway means a defined area at an airport that is prepared for the landing and takeoff of aircraft
along its length.
Structure means any object constructed or installed by man, including, but without limitation,
buildings, towers, smokestacks, and overhead transmission or distribution lines.
Transition Zone means a zone that extends outward at a right angle to the runway centerline and
upward at a rate of one (1) foot vertically for every seven feet horizontally (7:1). The height
limit of a transition zone begins at the height limit of the adjacent approach zone or operation
zone and ends at a height of 150 feet above the highest elevation on the existing or proposed
runway.
Tree means any object of natural growth.
Turning Zone shall comprise all portions of the hazard area not contained in the Operation
Zones, Approach Zones and in the Transitional Zones.
Turning Zone's Outer Limit means the area located at a distance of three (3) miles as a radius
from the corners of the operation zone of each runway and connecting adjacent arcs with tangent
lines, excluding any area within the approach zone, operation zone, or transition zone. The
height limit of the turning zone is I50 feet above the highest elevation on the existing or
proposed runway.
Visual Runway means a runway intended solely for the operation of aircraft using visual
approach procedures, with no straight-in instrument approach procedure and no instrument

designation indicated on an airport layout plan approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, a
military service-approved military layout plan, or any planning documents submitted to the
Federal Aviation Administration by a competent authority.
420.02. Hazard area description: The airport hazard area consists of operation zones, approach
zones, turning zones and transitional zones. The outer boundary of the hazard area is
composed of a series of connected tangents and simple curves which also constitute the outer
boundaries of the approach and turning zones. The inner boundary of the hazard area is a
boundary line consisting of a series of intersecting tangents five hundred (500) feet from and
parallel to the centerline of the instrument runway or landing strip and two hundred fifty (250)
feet from and parallel to the respective centerlines of all other runways or landing strips and
connecting the inner boundaries of adjacent approach zones at the ends of the runways,
landing strips or proposed runways or landing strips.
420.03. Zone descriptions:
1. The operation zones are longitudinally centered on each existing or proposed runway:
a) Length. For existing and proposed paved runways, the operation zone extends two
hundred (200) feet beyond the ends of each runway. For existing and proposed turf
runways, the operation zone begins and ends at the same points as the runway begins
and ends;
b) Width. For existing and proposed instrument runways, the operation zone is 1,000 feet
wide, with 500 feet on either side of the runway centerline. For all other existing and
proposed runways, the operation zone is 500 feet wide, with 250 feet on either side of the
runway centerline;
c) Height. The height limit of the operation zone is the same as the height of the runway
centerline elevation on an existing or proposed runway or the surface of the ground,
whichever is higher.
2. The approach zones extend from the end of each operation zone and are centered along the
extended runway centerlines. The dimensions of the zones are as follows:
a) For an existing or proposed instrument runway:
(1) Length and Width. An approach zone extends ten miles from the operation zone,
measured along the extended runway centerline. The approach zone is 1,000 feet wide
at the end of the zone nearest the runway and expands uniformly to 16,840 feet wide
at the farthest end of the zone; and
(2) Height Limit. The height limit of an approach zone begins at the elevation of the runway
end for which it is the approach and rises one (1) foot vertically for every 50 feet
horizontally, except that the height limit shall not exceed 150 feet above the nearest
existing or proposed runway end elevation within three (3) miles of the end of the
operation zone at that runway end. At three miles from such operation zone, the height
limit resumes sloping one foot vertically for every 50 feet horizontally and continues to
the ten-mile limit.
b) For an existing or proposed visual runway:
(1) Length and Width. An approach zone extends from the operation zone to the limits of
the turning zone, measured along the extended runway centerline. The approach zone
is 500 feet wide at the end of the zone nearest the runway and expands uniformly so
that at a point on the extended runway centerline three miles from the operation zone,
the approach zone is 3,700 feet wide; and
(2) Height. The height limit of an approach zone begins at the elevation of the runway end
for which it is the approach and rises one (1) foot vertically for every 40 feet horizontally,
except that the height limit shall not exceed 150 feet above the nearest existing or
proposed runway end elevation within three (3) miles of the end of the operation zone
at that runway end.
3. The transition zones extend outward at right angles to the runway centerline and upward at
a rate of one foot vertically for every seven feet horizontally (7:1). The height limit of these
zones begins at the height limit of the adjacent operation zones or approach zones. The
transition zones end at a height of 150 feet above the nearest existing or proposed runway
end.
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 60
4. The turning zonesextend three miles as a radius from the comers of the operation
zone of each runway and connecting adjacent arcs with tangent lines, excluding any area
within the approach zone, operation zone, or transition zone. The height limit of the turning
zones is 150 feet above the nearest existing or proposed runway end.
420.04. Height restrictions: No building, transmission line, communication line, pole, tree,
smokestack, chimney, wires, tower or other structure or appurtenance thereto of any kind or
character shall hereafter be erected, constructed, repaired or established, nor shall any tree
or other object of natural growth be allowed to grow, above the heights described in 420.03
1.
420.05. Location sketch and zoning map: The boundaries, operation zones, approach zones,
transition zones and turning zones of the Nebraska City, Nebraska Municipal Airport are as
indicated on Zoning Map Drawing No. ZN-NYC-91, which accompanies and is hereby made
a part of these regulations, a copy of which shall at all times be on file in the office of the city
clerk.
420.06. Permit required, exceptions, application forms and permit fees:
1. Permit required: It shall hereafter be unlawful to erect, construct, reconstruct, repair or
establish any building, transmission line, communication line, pole, tree, smoke-stack,
chimney, wires, tower or other structure or appurtenance thereto of any kind or character or
to plant or replant any tree or other object of natural growth within the boundary of the zoned
area of the municipal airport without first obtaining a zoning/building permit from the zoning
administrator.
2. Exceptions: In the outer area of approach zones and within turning zones, no such permit
shall be required for construction of planting which is no higher than seventy-five (75) feet
above the elevation of the end of the nearest runway or landing strip, except for any permits
required by other sections of this ordinance.
3. Application forms: Application for a zoning/building permit as required under these
regulations shall be made upon a form or forms to be available in the office of the zoning
administrator and shall indicate the approximate location, ground elevation with reference to
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 61
the elevation at the end of the nearest runway or landing strip and height of the proposed
structure or planting.
4. Permit fees: The fee for each zoning/building permit shall be the normal fee charged by the
city plus two dollars ($2.00) and said additional two dollars ($2.00) shall be paid to the city
treasurer who shall deposit said additional fees into the airport revenue fund.
420.07.
1. Non-conforming uses and structures: Within the zoned airport hazard area as
hereinbefore defined, no non-conforming building, transmission line, communication line,
pole, tree, smokestack, chimney, wires, tower or other structure or appurtenance thereto
of any kind or character or object of natural growth shall hereafter be replaced,
substantially reconstructed, repaired, altered, replanted or allowed to grow, as the case
may be, to a height which constitutes a greater hazard to air navigation than existed
before these regulations where adopted; nor above the heights permitted by these
regulations if such structures or objects of natural growth have been torn down, destroyed,
have deteriorated or decayed to an extent of eighty (80) percent or more of their original
condition, or abandoned for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months or more.
Transmission lines and communication lines as referred to in these regulations shall be
interpreted to mean all poles, wires, guys and all other equipment necessary for the
operation and maintenance of same within the airport hazard zone.
2. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section for certain electric facilities, all such
airport zoning regulations adopted under the act shall provide that before any
nonconforming structure or tree may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt,
allowed to grow higher, or replanted, a permit authorizing any replacement, alteration,
repair, reconstruction, growth, or replanting must be secured from the administrative
agency authorized to administer and enforce the regulations. A permit shall be granted
under this subsection if the applicant shows that the replacement, alteration, repair,
reconstruction, growth, or replanting of the nonconforming structure, tree, or
nonconforming use would not result in an increase in height or a greater hazard to air
navigation than the condition that existed when the applicable regulation was adopted. For
nonconforming structures other than electric facilities, no permit under this subsection
shall be required for repairs necessitated by fire, explosion, act of God, or the common
enemy or for repairs which do not involve expenditures exceeding more than sixty percent
of the fair market value of the nonconforming structure, so long as the height of the
nonconforming structure is not increased over its preexisting height.
3. An electric supplier owning or operating an electric facility made nonconforming by the
adoption of airport zoning regulations under the Airport Zoning Act may, without a permit
or other approval by the political subdivision adopting such regulations, repair, reconstruct,
or replace such electric facility if the height of such electric facility is not increased over its
preexisting height. Any construction, repair, reconstruction, or replacement of an electric
facility, the height of which will exceed the preexisting height of such electric facility, shall
require a permit from the political subdivision adopting such regulations. The permit shall
be granted only upon a showing that the excess height of the electric facility will not
establish or create an airport hazard or become a greater hazard to air navigation than the
electric facility that previously existed.
420.08. Marking of non-conforming structures: Whenever the zoning administrator shall determine,
or shall be notified by the joint airport zoning board or the Nebraska Department of Aeronautics,
that a specific non-conforming structure or object exists and has existed prior to the passage of
these regulations and within the airport hazard zoned area hereinbefore described at such a
height or in such a position as to constitute a hazard to the safe operation of aircraft landing at
or taking off from said airport, the owner or owners and the lessor or lessors of the premises on
which such structure or object is located shall be notified in writing by the zoning administrator
and shall, within a reasonable time, permit the marking thereof by suitable lights or other signals
designated by the zoning administrator as is based on recommendations of the Nebraska
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 62
Department of Aeronautics. The cost of such marking shall not be assessed against the owner
or lesser of said premise.
420.09. Administrative agency: The zoning administrator of the city shall administer and enforce
these regulations and shall be the administrative agency provided for in Section 3-319, R.R.S.
1943, and shall have all the powers and perform all the duties of the administrative agency as
provided by the Airport Zoning Act, until otherwise ordered by the Nebraska City, Nebraska
Joint Airport Zoning Board.
420.10. Board of adjustment: The board of adjustment of the city shall be the board of adjustment
with respect to these regulations, to have and to exercise the powers conferred by Section 3-
320, R.R.S. 1943, and such other powers and duties as are conferred and imposed by law.
420.11. Conflicts: In the event of any conflict between these airport hazard regulations and any
other regulations established by this or other ordinances, whether the conflict be with respect to
the height of structures or trees, the use of land or any other matter, the more stringent or
restrictive limitation shall govern and prevail.

Section 422 HCO Highway Corridor Overlay District
422.01 Intent:
Nebraska City has established basic site and building development criteria to be
implemented within the boundaries of this overlay district. These criteria include, but are
not limited to the following: landscaping, building material selection, lighting, signage, and
corridor development. The purpose for regulating these issues is to provide for a
cohesive and properly developed corridor area along and near Highway 2, Highway 75,
and Highway 75 Business. Guiding development in this manner promotes the general
health, safety and welfare of the residents and property owners within the zoning
jurisdiction of Nebraska City, by providing quality design and construction which will also
aid in the protection of past and future investment in the corridor. The regulations in the
overlay district are in addition to those of the underlying zoning district for the property
and effect all new or expanded public, commercial, industrial, and mixed-use buildings
and properties. Such criteria provided herein is to be a base set of guidelines established
and it is the intent of these guidelines that commercial and industrial used buildings
should be constructed as commercial and industrial in character to reflect the use and the
district. Detailed design guidelines may also be developed and administered through
development covenants and approved subdivision agreements. Where regulations are in
direct conflict with other regulations in these regulations, the stricter shall apply.
422.02. Purpose:
The purpose of these adopted minimum design standards is to promote quality design,
preserve the natural features, preserve the appearance of the natural and agricultural
landscape, and promote economic development along and near Highway 2, Highway 75
corridor, and Highway 75 Business. The design standards will encourage design
compatibility with the surrounding area, achieve greater architectural cohesiveness and
compatibility where appropriate, and minimize the negative visual impacts of site
development. These minimum standards shall apply to the design and placement of
landscaping, buffers, buildings, and exterior architectural features and finishes for
commercial, industrial, mixed use, civic, and multi-family developments and structures.
The purpose of these criteria is to establish a checklist of those items that affect the
physical aspect of Nebraska City. Pertinent to appearance is the design of the site,
building and structures, planting, signs, and miscellaneous other objects that are
observed by the public.
The criteria contained herein are not intended to restrict imagination, innovation or
variety, but rather to assist in focusing on design principles that can result in creative
solutions that will develop a satisfactory visual appearance within the city, preserve
taxable values, protect investments of property/land owners, and promote the public
health, safety and welfare. The requirements of the HCO District shall apply to any new
development requiring a building permit on land within the boundaries of the HCO District
after the effective date of this regulation. The requirements of the district do not apply to
any rehabilitation, repair, addition(s) or enlargement(s) of a building in place or under
construction on a site as of the effective date of this regulation, provided that the
cumulative gross floor area of any addition(s) does not exceed 50% of the gross floor
area of the pre-existing building(s). Furthermore, the requirements of the district do not
apply to single family or two-family houses. All structures located in all districts other
than residential, shall be constructed to office, business, light industrial in appearance
depending on the zoning district and land use they are in and in accordance with these
regulations.

422.08. Criteria for Appearance:
(1) General Design Standards
The goal and purpose of these design standards is to create a sense of place within
the city. Here, the design standards are intended to establish the baseline
requirements for design that reflects the desired regional character, while allowing
flexibility for individual project design that works with the jurisdiction of Nebraska City.
The following standards are applicable to all development types:
(a) Protection of Natural Features, Resources, and Sensitive Areas
(i) Intent
Protect significant natural features, resources, and sensitive areas (i.e. flood
plain, wetlands, etc.) as designated on the land use plan in order to minimize
the impacts of development on the environment and create more distinctive
site development. Where appropriate, natural features, resources, and
sensitive areas may be used as amenities to enhance the value of
development.
(ii) Standards
Development shall be organized and designed to protect, appropriately use,
or enhance the following types of natural resources and features. This shall
be accomplished by restricting development in these areas and then
including such features in common landscaped areas or dedicated open
space, by allowing construction in these areas that is sensitive to the
protection of these features, or by mitigating impacts. If possible, these
features shall be connected or integrated with similar features on adjacent
lands. The following features shall be given consideration in this category:
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 70
• Water features (in addition to floodplains, which are dedicated);
• Parks and public open space areas on or adjacent to the site;
• Historic or archeological sites or areas that have been recognized by the
local governing body as significant;
• Riparian wildlife habitat, as identified by State and/or Federal Agencies;
• Other natural features such as bluffs, ridges, steep slopes, stands of
mature trees, rock outcroppings, or wetlands; and
In addition,
a. Development shall be prohibited from locating within the designated
floodway as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
and in conformance with current floodplain regulations.
b. Consideration shall be given to setbacks for developments adjacent to a
wetland or natural area as defined by the land use plan. Where an
existing setback is in place, such setback shall be followed.
c. Many best management practices (BMPs) for the protection of natural
features exist and may be applicable within the corridor.
(b) Open Natural Areas and Amenities
(i) Intent
Developments shall set aside for future development open space, trails, and
amenities in accordance with the Nebraska City Comprehensive Plan,
adopted master plan(s), and the adopted subdivision regulations, as such
areas should be set aside in easements or platted outlots. “Open areas”
means unoccupied space on the same lot with the building subject to the
open area requirement and shall consist of private open space, open
recreational facilities, areas used exclusively for pedestrian and nonmotorized
traffic, and those areas designated as natural areas on the land
use plan. Parking lots, recreational vehicle and equipment storage areas,
public and private roadways, and structures shall not be considered “open
areas”.
(ii) Standards
To the maximum extent practicable, and in accordance with any applicable
subdivision regulations, open areas shall be organized so as to include or
protect as many of the natural resources and features identified in the
previous section as possible.
a. Open areas shall be organized so as to create integrated systems of
open areas that connect with the following types of lands located within
or adjacent to the development plan or plat:
• Dedicated park lands;
• Dedicated open spaces;
• Any local or regional trail or open space system; and
• Activity or community centers.
b. Each open area shall be adjacent to or visible from at least one
dedicated public street or public site of the development. The majority of
open areas shall not be located in isolated corners of the development,
in peripheral strips along the borders of the development, or in
unconnected patterns unless such a location is necessary to achieve one
of the connections or visibility requirements.
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 71
c. Land features such as existing topography, streams, forestation, ponds
or open areas should be used when possible to naturally separate
commercial and industrial uses from residential uses.
d. Stormwater management systems shall be located, designed, and
managed to serve as visual amenities, entryways features, or
opportunities for passive recreation whenever possible.
e. The following stormwater management techniques, when designed
pursuant to generally recognized standards and specifications and when
long-term maintenance is provided, may be included as open space and
may qualify for a reduction in required landscaping up to 10 percent of
the total:
• Bioretention facilities,
• Rain gardens,
• Infiltration swales and trenches, or
• Any alternative method identified by the jurisdiction.
f. On sites with existing, mature trees in areas designated as natural areas
on the land use plan, such significant trees shall be identified, evaluated
(for disease, safety and structure), and preserved. For the purposes of
this section, “significant” trees include the following:
• Deciduous trees with 24- inch minimum caliper;
• Evergreen trees 20 feet or more in height; or
Significant Tree Replacement.
• Where significant trees cannot feasibly be preserved, the total caliper
inches of the tree(s) that are removed shall be replaced by the same
caliper inches of new trees. If trees cannot be replaced size for size,
then additional trees are required. The new trees shall either be of
the same or similar species, or if identified by the City for species
diversification, shall be from a list within the Highway Corridor
Overlay District Design Guideline Booklet or a list of permissible
species approved by the City through the University of Nebraska
Forestry Department. Additional recommended plant material is
provided by the Nebraska State Arboretum and is included as an
appendix to the I-80 Design Guidelines developed by the Nebraska
Innovative Zone Commission.
(c) On-Site Automobile, Pedestrian, and Bicycle Circulation
(i) Intent
Create an efficient vehicular circulation system that avoids the creation of
large, isolated tracts without routes for through traffic. Create a safe,
continuous pedestrian and bicycle network that minimizes conflict with
vehicular movement while promoting a convenient option for movement
within and between developments.
(ii) Standards
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 72

within development centers.
(i) Standards
a. To the maximum extent possible, development on larger sites containing
multiple buildings shall be composed of a series of “blocks” of
development defined by streets and driveways that provide links to
adjacent streets along the perimeter of the site.
b. New buildings located along a street/road frontage shall, to the maximum
extent feasible, align building walls with existing adjacent buildings and
buildings across the street to help create a consistent building edge.
c. New buildings shall be oriented, so that loading bays, dock and service
areas are not visible from the corridor and public right-of-way, or
otherwise screened from view of such corridor and public right-of-way
with landscape and/or earthen berms or other building materials.
d. Unless part of a larger planned development, mixed use, or commercial
center:
• When there is one building with a single tenant, the building’s
“active” wall or storefront shall be oriented toward the primary
abutting street; or
• When there is one building with a single tenant and because of
topography, the building’s “active” wall or storefront cannot be
oriented toward the primary abutting street, then such wall oriented
to said street shall be of architectural character; or
• When there is one building with multiple tenants, at least 50 percent
of the building’s “active” wall or storefronts shall be oriented toward
the primary abutting street.
e. Where there is more than one building in a development, all principal and
pad site buildings shall be arranged and grouped so that their primary
orientation complements adjacent, existing development and either:
• Frames the corner of an adjacent street intersection;
• Frames and encloses a main street pedestrian and/or vehicle access
corridor within the development site;
• Frames and encloses on at least three sides parking areas, public
spaces, or other site amenities.
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 76
f. To the maximum extent feasible, building layout shall follow and respect
the natural topography of the site. Berms, channels, swales, and similar
man-made change to the landscape shall be designed and graded to be
an integral part of the natural landscape and to provide a smooth
transition in changes in slope.
(3) Building Design
(a) Intent
Provide a high quality architectural character in all commercial and industrial
developments. See Highway Corridor Overlay District Design Guideline Booklet
for case study (examples of developments or buildings considered meeting this
concept).
(b) Standards
(i) Building Orientation
Buildings on lots that front the Highway 2, Highway 75, and Highway 75
Business corridors should be oriented to present a front or side view to the
road/highway/ roadways. Architectural or landscape features are also
encouraged to be located facing the roadways.
(ii) Four-Sided Design
These standards shall apply to the primary façade of a building and all sides
of the building where visible from the Highway 2, Highway 75 corridor, and
Highway 2 Business rights-of-way, adjacent residential properties, and
park/recreation areas shall include design characteristics and material
consistent with those of the primary façade, except as provided. Additional
building screening shall be required where certain façade requirements are
waived by the city.
(iii) Building Form
The design of all buildings shall avoid incorporating monotonous, unbroken
flat walls through the use of textured surfaces, projections, recesses, shadow
lines, color, window patterns, overhangs, reveals, changes in parapet
heights, and similar architectural devices. Buildings having single walls
exceeding 50 feet in length shall incorporate two or more of the following at
50-foot intervals:
a. Changes in color, graphical patterning, changes in texture, or changes in
material(s);
b. Projections, recesses, and reveals with a minimum change in plane of 24
inches;
c. Windows and fenestration;
d. Arcades and pergolas;
e. Towers;
f. Gable projections;
g. Horizontal/vertical breaks; or
h. Other similar techniques.
(c) Franchise Architecture
Franchise architecture that meets minimum standards is allowed. National
“standard”, prototype, or trademark designs shall be adapted to be compatible
with these standards.
(d) Building Materials and Colors
(i) Intense, bright, or fluorescent colors shall not be used as the predominant
color on any wall or roof of any primary or accessory structure. These colors
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 77
may be used as building accent colors but shall not constitute more than
10% of the area of each elevation of the building. See Highway Corridor
Overlay District Design Guideline Booklet for examples of preferred colors.
Permitted sign areas shall be excluded from this calculation.
(ii) Highly reflective or glare producing glass with a reflectance factor of .25 or
higher is prohibited on all façades. Such prohibition shall apply whether the
glass is used in windows or spandrel areas.
(iii) All building façades 600 feet from the Highway 2, Highway 75 corridor and
Highway 75 Business rights-of-way shall be finished with the same materials
and colors and the same degree of window arrangement and articulation
used on the major entry walls that are the front of the building, excluding
docks and doors on building that are adequately screened according to these
regulations.
(e) Roofs
(i) Roof types should be related to the building’s function and character. Gabled
and pitched roofs are generally appropriate for one and two-story
construction, while more massive buildings are best suited for hipped roofs or
flat roofs placed behind a parapet wall.
(ii) Sustainable roofs are encouraged. Sustainable roofs include:
a. Cool roofs that for a minimum of 75 percent of the total roof surface have
a Solar Reflectance Index (SRI) of 78 or higher for a roof with a slope of
2:12 or less, or 29 or higher for a roof with a slope greater than 2:12; or
b. A vegetated roof consisting of a minimum of 50% of the total roof
surface.
(f) Screening and Fencing
(i) Rooftop Equipment and Screening. All rooftop mechanical equipment and
vents greater than eight inches in diameter shall be screened from the
immediately adjacent Highway 2, Highway 75 corridor, and Highway 75
Business rights-of-way. Screening may be done either with an extended
parapet wall or a free-standing screen wall. Screens shall be at least as high
as the equipment they hide and shall be of a color material matching or
compatible with the dominant colors and materials found on the façades of
the primary building.
(ii) Service Area and Loading Dock Screening. Loading docks, on-site storage
yards, and all other service areas shall be oriented away from and/or shall be
substantially screened from view from all the Highway 2, Highway 75, and
Highway 75 Business corridor by natural topography, berms, walls, fences,
and/or opaque landscaping. Screens shall be of a color material matching or
compatible with the dominant colors and materials found on the façades of
the primary building. The screen height shall be of sufficient height to hide
the equipment, vehicles, materials, or trash being screened from public view
and consistent with the adopted fence regulations, but in no case shall the
screen exceed 10 feet. Chain link fences, with or without slats, shall not be
used to satisfy this screening requirement.
(g) Lighting
Lighting standards and fixtures for the roadways, parking areas and drives within
the commercial, industrial, business park, mixed use, public/quasi-public, and
multi-family building areas shall be similar in appearance and quality level as
those in the Highway Corridor Overlay District Design Guideline Booklet. Such
style shall be submitted by the developer, determined by the city, and adopted as
part of established covenants, mixed-use development agreement, and/or
subdivision agreement.
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 78
(i) All lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas, signs or other
structures shall be arranged so as to deflect light away from any adjoining
residential property through fixture type and location.
(ii) The maximum height of lighting standards shall be 45 feet, unless the city
grants a specific exception as part of the planned unit development
application approval process.
(iii) Exterior lighting of buildings shall be limited to low-level incandescent
spotlights, floodlights, and similar illuminating devices hooded in such a
manner that the direct beam of any light sources will not glare upon adjacent
property or public streets. The city may approve exceptions to these
requirements for sports and athletic field lighting, flagpole lighting, public
street lighting, temporary lighting for seasonal/holiday or special events, and
lighting used for public safety.
(4) Towers, Alternative Energy, Signs
(a) Cell Towers
Within the Highway Corridor Overlay District, the use of a stealth cell tower
design is required and shall meet all required regulations.
(b) Solar Energy
(i) Purpose
This section is intended to promote the compatible use of solar energy
systems and to assist in decreasing Nebraska City’s dependence upon nonrenewable
energy systems through the encouragement of solar energy
systems for the generation of energy and the heating of buildings and water.
(ii) Standards
Solar energy systems shall be a permitted use. Private restrictions on solar
energy systems, such as business owner’s association covenants or
restrictions, are not permitted.
(iii) Height
In solar retrofit installations, solar energy collectors, storage tanks and
equipment, roof ponds, or other solar equipment appurtenant to a solar
energy system may exceed by three feet the local maximum height limits.
Systems taller than three feet above any maximum height shall be subject to
local approval.
(iv) Setbacks and Screening
In solar retrofit installations, solar energy collectors, storage tanks and
equipment, roof ponds, or other solar equipment appurtenant to a solar
energy system may extend into the required setbacks a maximum of three
feet. Systems extending more than three feet into any required setback
shall be subject to approval. Where possible, such solar equipment shall be
screened from public view within the rights-of-way with structures or plant
material when adjacent to Highways 2, 75 and Business 75.
(v) Conflict with Other City Policies and Ordinances
Nothing in this subsection does or is intended to abrogate the owner’s
responsibility to meet all other requirements of the city’s land use regulations,
including, but not limited to, the preservation of private and public views, the
quality of architectural design, and the preservation of historic landmark
structures.
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 79
(5) Small Wind Energy Systems
(a) Purpose
This section is intended to promote the compatible use of small wind energy
systems. Wind energy is an abundant, renewable, and nonpolluting energy
resource. When converted to electricity, it reduces our dependence on
nonrenewable energy resources and reduces air and water pollution that result
from conventional sources. Distributed wind energy structures also enhance the
reliability and power quality of the power grid, reduce peak power demands, and
increase local electricity generation.
(b) Standards
Small wind energy systems shall be limited to one (1) tower and shall be
permitted on lots of at least 20,000 square feet that are not adjacent to residential
uses. They are subject to the adopted zoning regulations and following
requirements:
(i) Setbacks
A wind tower for a small wind system shall be set back a distance of 1.0
times its total height from:
a. Any public road right-of-way, unless written permission is granted by the
governmental entity with jurisdiction over the road;
b. Any overhead utility lines, unless written permission is granted by the
affected utility; and
c. All property lines, unless written permission is granted from the affected
land owner or neighbor. Written permission must be recorded in the
property chain of title and will run with the land.
d. No part of the system, including guy wire anchors, may be closer than
five feet from any property boundary.
(ii) Access
a. All ground mounted electrical and control equipment shall be labeled or
secured to prevent unauthorized access.
b. The tower shall be designed and installed so as to not provide step bolts
or a ladder readily accessible to the public for a minimum height of eight
feet above the ground.
(iii) Lighting
A wind tower and generator shall not be artificially lighted unless such
lighting is required by the Federal Aviation Administration. A light temporarily
used to inspect a turbine, tower, and associated equipment is permissible,
providing said light is only used for inspection purposes and not left on for an
extended period of time.
(iv) Decibel Levels
Decibel levels for the system shall not exceed the lesser of 60 decibels (Dba)
as measured at the closest neighboring inhabited dwelling, except during
short-term events such as utility outages and severe wind storms.
(v) Signs
All signs, other than the manufacturer’s or installer’s identification,
appropriate warning signs, or owner identification on a wind generator, tower,
building, or other structure associated with a small wind energy system
visible from any public road shall be prohibited.
(vi) Code Compliance
A wind energy structure including tower shall comply with all applicable State
construction and electrical codes, and the National Electrical Code as
adopted by the city.

underlying zoning district.
b. The structure shall comply with all applicable Federal Aviation
Administration requirements, including but not limited to Subpart B
(commencing with Section 77.11) of Part 77 of Title 14 of the Code of
Federal Regulations regarding installations in excess of 200 feet in
height and, installations close to airports. The system shall also comply
with any and all Nebraska aeronautics regulations.
(viii) Met and New Technology
a. Temporary meteorological (Met) towers shall be permitted under the
same standards as a small wind energy system, except that the
requirements shall be the same as those for a temporary structure. A
permit for a temporary Met tower shall be valid for a maximum of three
years after which an extension may be granted. Permanent Met towers
may be permitted under the same standards as a small wind energy
system.
(6) Commercial Wind Energy Systems
Commercial wind energy systems shall not be permitted to locate within the
Highway Corridor Overlay District.
(8) Commercial, Office, Public/Quasi-Public, Mixed Use, and Business Development
(a) Intent

Small Wind Energy Conversion System
528.03. Intent: It is the purpose of this regulation to promote the safe, effective and efficient use of
wind energy systems installed to reduce consumption of electricity on site and produce minor
amounts of electricity for local utility use.
528.04. Permitted use: Small wind energy conversion systems shall be permitted, as an accessory
use within any district as long as certain requirements as set forth below shall be met:
1. Tower height:
A. For all residential or residentially zoned properties tower height shall be limited to thirtyfive
(35) feet or the maximum height for a structure in that district; tower must meet
required setbacks.
B. For non-residential or non-residentially zoned properties between twenty thousand
(20,000) square feet and one-acre tower height shall be limited to thirty-five (35) feet or
the maximum height for a structure in that district; tower must meet required setbacks.
C. For non-residential or non-residentially zoned properties greater than one acre in size,
there is a 50-foot height limit and the tower must meet required setbacks.
D. Wind energy facilities shall be sited in a manner that minimizes shadowing of flicker
impacts. The applicant has the burden of proving that this effect does not have
significant adverse impact on neighboring or adjacent uses.
Educational note: Shadow flicker is caused by sunlight passing through the swept area of the wind
turbine's blades. As sunlight passes through the spinning blades, it is possible to have a stroboscopic
effect that can, under the right conditions, affect persons prone to epilepsy. In general, these conditions
require varying light intensity at frequencies of 2.5-3 Hz. Large commercial turbines are typically limited to
a frequency of less than 1.75 Hz. Furthermore, the impacts of shadow flicker diminish rapidly with
distance and should be minimal at ten (10) or more rotor diameters. Though the RPM for smaller turbines
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 41
is generally higher (up to 350 RPM, for some turbines), the small size of the rotor swept area, combined
with the shorter tower heights, support a negligible shadow flicker impact from these types of facilities. In
any case, the effects of shadow flicker are a seasonal and/or diurnal impact, requiring that the sun be at
the right position in the sky to generate a line of sight with the affected building and the wind turbine rotor.
As such, the impacts of shadow flicker will generally only be felt for a few hours per year.
2. Minimum lot size:
A. Towers shall not be permitted on any lot of less than twenty thousand (20,000) square
feet.
3. Noise:
A. Small wind energy systems shall not exceed sixty-five (65) dBA during daytime hours

inhabited dwelling unit.
B. The noise level may be exceeded during short-term events such as utility outages
and/or severe windstorms (wind speeds of greater than fifty (50) miles per hour.)
4. Approved wind turbines:
A. Small wind turbines must have been approved under the Emerging Technologies
program of the California Energy Commission or any other small certification program
recognized by the American Wind Energy Association.
B. Wind turbines shall not be modified from manufacturer's specifications or design/build
in any manner.
5. Compliance with building and zoning codes:
A. Applications for small wind energy systems shall be accomplished by standard
drawings of the wind turbine structure, including the tower base, and footings.
B. An engineering analysis of the tower showing compliance with official building code of
the governing body and/or the State of Nebraska and certified by a licensed
professional engineer shall also be submitted.

9. Decommissioning:
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 42
A. Small wind energy systems shall be considered discontinued or decommissioned after
one (1) year without energy production. All small WECS and accessory facilities,
including the base and footing shall be completely removed within (one hundred eighty
180) days of the discontinuation of use.
528.05 Setbacks:
A. No part of the wind system structure, including guy-wire anchors, may extend closer than
ten (10) feet to the property lines of the installation site; tower must meet required underlying
setbacks.
B. All towers for SWECS shall adhere to the setbacks established in the following table:
Required Setbacks for SWECS Towers
Property Lines 1.1 times the total height
Road Rights-of-way* 1.1 times the total height
Other Rights-of-Way 1.1 times the total height
* The setback shall be measured from any future rights-of-way if a planned change or
expanded right-of-way is known.

impact on neighboring or adjacent uses.
Educational note: Shadow flicker is caused by sunlight passing through the swept area of the wind
turbine's blades. As sunlight passes through the spinning blades, it is possible to have a stroboscopic
effect that can, under the right conditions, affect persons prone to epilepsy. In general, these conditions
require varying light intensity at frequencies of 2.5—3 Hz. Large commercial turbines are typically limited
to a frequency of less than 1.75 Hz. Furthermore, the impacts of shadow flicker diminish rapidly with
distance and should be minimal at ten (10) or more rotor diameters. Though the RPM for smaller turbines
is generally higher (up to 350 RPM, for some turbines), the small size of the rotor swept area, combined
with the shorter tower heights, support a negligible shadow flicker impact from these types of facilities. In
any case, the effects of shadow flicker are a seasonal and/or diurnal impact, requiring that the sun be at
the right position in the sky to generate a line of sight with the affected building and the wind turbine rotor.
As such, the impacts of shadow flicker will generally only be felt for a few hours per year.

Section 529 - ADULT ESTABLISHMENTS
529.01 Purpose and Intent
It is the purpose of this section to regulate Adult Establishments to promote the health, safety,
morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of Adult Establishments within the
city’s jurisdiction. The provisions of these regulations have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of these
regulations to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the
First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 46
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of these regulations to
condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

Evidence, Law and Policy, Vol. 31, No. 2 (April 2009), Adult Business Study: Town and Village
of Ellicottville, Cattaraugus County, New York (January 1998), the city finds:
1. Adult Establishments, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide
variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property
crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity,
illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban
blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment
and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects.
2. Adult Establishments should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the
impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 48
adult establishments, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and
to prevent an unnecessary concentration of adult establishments in one area.
3. Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a
substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. Additionally, the city’s
interest in regulating Adult Establishments extends to preventing future secondary
effects of either current or future adult establishments that may locate in the city. The city
finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this resolution are reasonably
believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related
to the adverse secondary effects of adult establishments, including the judicial opinions and
reports related to such secondary effects.

exist lots, structures, or use of land and structures, or characteristics of structures or use which
were legally established on the date of adoption of this ordinance, but which are prohibited,
regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or amendment thereto. It is the intent
of this ordinance to permit these non-conformities to continue until such are removed, but not to

be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or
uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zoning district.
601.02 Non-conforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses
in the applicable zoning district. A non-conforming use of a structure, of land or of a structure
and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after adoption of this ordinance by
attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to seen from off the premises
or by the addition of other uses which are prohibited in the applicable zoning district.
601.03 To avoid any undue hardship, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a change

permit has been lawfully issued or for which actual construction has been lawfully initiated prior
to the effective date of the ordinance or amendment thereto where actual construction activity
has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is defined to be the placing of substantial
construction materials, other than earth, in a permanent position and fastened in a permanent

record on the date of adoption of this ordinance or amendment thereto. Such lot of record must
be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.
The provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area, width, or
both, of the applicable zoning district, provided that yard dimensions shall conform to the
applicable zoning district regulations.
602.02 If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots or portions of lots with continuous frontage and
in the same ownership are of record on the date of adoption of this ordinance or applicable
amendment thereto, and if all or part of the lots do not comply with the lot width and area
requirements of the applicable zoning district, the lots or portions or lots involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this ordinance and no portion of such
lot or portions of lots shall be used or sold in a manner which would diminish compliance with

increase its non-conformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to reduce
its non-conformity.

area which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the date of adoption of
this ordinance or applicable amendment thereto, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building or area.
3. If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of a structure or structure
and premises may, as a conditional use, be changed to another non-conforming use
provided that the commission, either by general rule or findings in the specific case, shall
find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the applicable
zoning district than the existing non-conforming use. In permitting such change, the
commission may require compliance with conditions and safeguards which it deems
appropriate.
4. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a non-conforming use is
superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the requirements of this
ordinance and a non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed or established.

ordinance or applicable amendment thereto.
606.02 If a non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-conforming use
becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to a lack of repairs or maintenance and is declared
by any authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of such physical condition, such

relating to the location or soundness of structures, or to interpret any map.
1. The board of adjustment shall hear and determine appeals from any requirement,

of such appeal. The zoning administrator shall provide all papers constituting the
applicable records of the administrator to the board on or before the date of the hearing set
for hearing the appeal.
3. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed unless the zoning
administrator certifies to the board, after a notice of appeal has been filed, that by reason
of facts in such case, that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such
case proceedings shall not be stayed, except by a restraining order which may be granted
by the board or court.
802.02. Powers and jurisdiction relating to map interpretation: The board of adjustment shall have
the power and responsibility to hear and decide questions regarding the interpretation of the
official zoning map in the same manner as the hearing of an appeal and in accordance with the
limitations set forth in Section 406 of this ordinance.
802.03. Powers and jurisdiction relating to variances: The board of adjustment shall have the power
to authorize, in specific cases, a variance from the specific terms of this ordinance which will not
be contrary to the public interest and where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this ordinance would, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship,
and provided that the spirit of this ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare
secured, and substantial justice done. A variance may be granted in such case upon findings of
the board that all of the following conditions have been met:
1. Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of
property at the time of the enactment of this ordinance, or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of each
specific piece of property, the strict application of any applicable provision of this ordinance
would result in peculiar or exceptional practical difficulties to, or exceptional and undue
hardship upon the owner of such property, the board of adjustment shall have the power to
authorize a variance from the strict application of such applicable provision so as to relieve
such difficulties or hardship if such relief may be granted without substantial detriment to
the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this
ordinance. No such variance shall be authorized by the board unless and until it finds that:
A. The strict application of the applicable provisions of this ordinance would produce
undue difficulty or hardship;
B. Such difficulty or hardship is not generally shared by other properties in the same
zoning district and the same vicinity;
C. The authorization of a variance shall not be of substantial detriment to adjacent
property and the character of the zoning district will not be changed by the
authorization of a variance;
D. The authorization of a variance is based upon reasons of demonstrable and
exceptional difficulty or hardship, as distinguished from a variance for purposes of the
property owner's convenience, profit, or caprice;
Page 3
E. The condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the
property is not of so general or recurring nature as to make reasonably practicable the
formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to this ordinance.
2. A variance from the terms of this ordinance shall not be granted by the board of adjustment
unless and until a written application for a variance is submitted to the zoning
administrator. Such application shall be in the form prescribed by the board and the
applicant shall identify the special conditions and circumstances which are peculiar to the
land, the structure(s) or building involved which, in the opinion of the applicant, are not
applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district. The applicant
shall also 1) state the reason(s) that a literal enforcement of the applicable provision(s) of
this ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties
in the same zoning district under the terms of this ordinance, 2) indicate why the conditions
or circumstances related to such variance do not result from the action of the applicant,
and 3) the reason(s) that granting of the requested variance will not confer any special
privilege on the applicant that is denied by the provisions of this ordinance to other land,
structures, or buildings in the same zoning district.
3. A non-conforming use of neighboring land, structure(s) or building(s) in the same zoning
district, and permitted or non-conforming uses of land, structure(s) or building(s) in other
zoning districts shall not be considered grounds for difficulty or hardship and thus the
authorization of a variance.
4. Upon filing of a variance application with the zoning administrator, notice of public hearing
shall be published in the same manner as set forth in Subsection 801.02 above and the
board of zoning adjustment shall conduct a public hearing. Any party may appear in person
or be represented by agent or attorney. Upon closing of such public hearing the board shall
take any of the following actions:
A. Continue the application for a specified period of time to allow the board to gather
more information in regard to the variance application. In acting to continue such
application the board shall set a specific date, time and place where it shall take
further action of continued application;
B. Deny the application for a variance and state the reason(s) for such denial;
C. Authorize a variance, provided that the board shall make written findings that
particular reasons set forth in the application justify the authorization of a variance and
that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use
of the land, structure(s) or building(s) and shall make written findings that the
authorization of said variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this ordinance and will not be injurious to abutting property, the property in the
vicinity of the subject property or be otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
5. In authorizing any variance, the board of adjustment may prescribe any conditions and
safeguards it believes are appropriate to protect abutting property, property in the vicinity
and the public in general. Violation of such conditions and safeguards by the applicant
shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance and punishable under Section 1102 of this
ordinance.
6. Under no circumstances shall the board of zoning adjustment authorize a variance to allow
a use not permitted under the regulations of any zoning district or any use expressly or by
implication prohibited by the regulations of any zoning district.
802.04 Board of adjustment has powers of zoning administrator upon appeal. In exercising the
above mentioned powers, the board of adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partially, or
may modify the order, requirement, decision, or interpretation as ought to be made and to this
end shall have all powers of the zoning administrator, provided that a concurring vote of fourfifths
(4/5) of the members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement,
Page 4
decision or interpretation of the zoning administrator or to decide in favor of any applicant upon
which it is required to act under this ordinance or to authorize any variance to this ordinance.
802.05. Appeals from decisions of the board of adjustment: Any person or persons, jointly or
severally, aggrieved by any decision of the board of zoning adjustment, or any taxpayer, or any
officer, department, board or bureau of the city may present to the district court a petition, duly
verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, and specifying the grounds
of such illegality as provided for in law. Such petition must be presented to the court within
fifteen (15) days after the filing of the decision of the board of zoning adjustment in the office of
the city clerk.

regarding any inconsistencies in phasing of the subdivision development to the city council for its
consideration.
The commission may, as a condition of recommendation of approval, attach any reasonable
condition to bring the subdivision or plat into conformance with the requirements of this ordinance
and the comprehensive plan of the city. If a recommendation of denial is forwarded to the city
council, the commission shall state the specific reason(s) for such recommendation. The
commission shall cause the subdivider to be notified in writing of its action within ten (10) days of
such public hearing and such notification shall state any conditions of approval or any reasons
for rejection as specified in Section 503.08 below.
503.08 Recording of action by the planning commission: The action of the commission shall be noted

(Ord. No. 2583-03, § 1, 8-18-03)
ARTICLE 6. - SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS
Section 601. - General requirements.
Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used safely for building purposes without
danger to health or peril from fire, flood, erosion or other menace. If, following investigation, conducted by
all public agencies concerned, it is determined that land to be subdivided cannot be used without
endangering the health, safety, welfare or would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public financial
resources for streets, water and sewer facilities, storm sewers or other facility, the subdivision shall not be
approved unless the subdivider formulates adequate methods for meeting such problems.
All subdivision designs shall conform to the standards of the comprehensive plan of current adoption
and the zoning ordinance of the city. And all required improvements and installations shall be constructed
or installed to conform with the provisions of this ordinance and the standard specifications of the city.
Section 602. - Streets.
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to the major
street plan, a component of the comprehensive plan, and shall be considered in their relation to existing
and planned streets, to topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate
relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
602.01 Street extensions: The street layout in the proposed subdivision shall provide for the
continuation or appropriate extension of streets and alleys already existing in areas adjacent to
the area being subdivided. Where, at the recommendation of the planning commission and
agreement by the city council, it is desirable to provide street access to adjoining properties,
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 19
proposed streets shall be extended to the boundaries of the subdivision. Where the planning
commission and city council deems it necessary, such dead-end streets shall be provided with a
temporary turnaround having a radius of at least twenty-five (25) feet. The street system for the
proposed subdivision shall provide for extending existing streets at the same or greater width,
but in no case shall a street extension be of less width than the minimum width required for the
classification of such street by this ordinance.
602.02 Dedication of rights-of-way for new streets: The dedication of rights-of-way for new streets,
measured from lot line to lot line, shall be as shown on the major street plan, a component of
the comprehensive plan, and shall meet the right-of-way width requirements as set forth in
schedule a of this ordinance. All streets classified as arterial streets in the major street plan
shall have all points of access approved by the city council. Dedication of one-half (½) rights-ofway
for a proposed street along the boundaries of the land being subdivided shall be prohibited,
except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision and where it is found
to be practical and reasonable to require dedication of the other one-half (½) of the right-of-way
when the adjoining property is subdivided.
Marginal access streets (frontage roads) shall be required by the city council for all subdivisions
fronting on a street classified in the city's major street plan as a major arterial street where any of
the following conditions exist:
A. The frontage of the proposed subdivision along the major arterial street is three hundred
(300) feet or greater.
B. The frontage of the proposed subdivision along the major arterial street is less than three
hundred (300) feet, but the first one hundred fifty (150) feet of land adjoining the subdivision
on either side is undeveloped.
C. The frontage of the proposed subdivision along the major arterial street is less than three
hundred (300) feet, and the first one hundred fifty (150) feet of land adjoining the subdivision
on either side is developed, but such development is so situated relative to the right-of-way
of the major arterial street that it would not prohibit the construction of a marginal access
(frontage road).
If double frontage lots within the proposed subdivision are to front on a major arterial street, but
such lots shall not have access directly from such major arterial street and shall have access only
through an interior street, a marginal access street may not be required. (Refer to Section 605.05
of this ordinance).
602.03 Dedication of rights-of-way for existing streets: Subdivisions platted along existing streets
shall dedicate additional right-of-way if necessary to meet the minimum street right-of-way
standards set forth in the ordinance. The entire minimum right-of-way shall be dedicated where
the subdivision is on both sides of an existing street. When the subdivision is located on only
one side of an existing street, one-half (½) of the required right-of-way, measured from the
centerline of the existing street shall be dedicated.
In the development of residential subdivisions utilizing zero-lot line and clustered development
housing styles, the city council may grant a right-of-way variance to reduce the right-of-way
dedication to the width of the street pavement for streets classified as local streets with the
provision that utility and sidewalk easements not less than ten (10) feet in width shall be provided
on either side of said reduced right-of-way and that the housing be set back a minimum of twenty
(20) feet from the easement line furthest from the street.
602.04 Intersections: Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at an angle of ninety (90) degrees
and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than sixty (60) degrees. Street curb intersections
shall be rounded by radii of at least twenty (20) feet. When the smallest angle of a street
intersection is less than seventy-five (75) degrees, the city council may require greater curb
radii. Wherever necessary to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius without
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 20
reducing the sidewalk at such street corner to less than nominal width, the property line at such
street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such construction.
602.05 Horizontal and vertical street curves: A tangent at least one hundred (100) feet long shall be
introduced between reversed curves on arterial and collector streets. Where there is a
deflection angle of more than ten (10) degrees in the alignment of a street, a curve with a radius
adequate to insure safe site distance shall be provided. The minimum radii of street curves shall
be as set forth in Schedule A of this ordinance.
All changes of grade shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent to
eighty-five (85) times the algebraic difference in the rate of grade, expressed in feet per hundred
for arterial streets, fifty-five (55) times the algebraic difference for collector streets, thirty-five (35)
times the algebraic difference for local and other minor streets.
602.06 Street grades and elevations: All streets shall be designed so as to provide for the discharge
of surface water from the pavement and from the right-of-way by grading and drainage. For
adequate drainage, the minimum street grade shall not be less than three tenths (0.3) of one (1)
percent. Minimum grades for gutters and ditches shall be four-tenths (0.4) of one (1) percent
and five-tenths (0.5) of one (1) percent respectively. Storm sewer construction shall be required
where necessary to meet these minimum grade requirements.
The city council shall not approve streets which will be subject to inundation or flooding. All streets
must be located at elevations which will make them flood-free in order that portions of the
subdivisions will not be isolated by floods. Where flood conditions exist, the city council shall
require profiles or elevations of streets in order to determine the advisability of permitting the
proposed subdivision activity. Fill may be used in areas subject to flooding in order to provide
flood-free streets if such fill does not increase flood heights up stream. Drainage openings shall
be designed so as not to restrict the flow of water and thereby increase flood heights. Street
grades shall conform to the minimum requirements provided in schedule a of this ordinance.
602.07 Marginal access streets: Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
major arterial street, the city council shall require marginal access streets, reverse frontage lots
with screen planting contained in a no-access reservation along the rear property line or such
other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of the platted properties and to
afford separation of through and local traffic.
Where the proposed subdivision abuts upon or contains an existing or proposed major arterial
street on which traffic volumes and vehicular speeds warrant special safety considerations, the
city council shall require that marginal access streets be provided in order that no new lots shall
front on or have access directly to such existing or proposed arterial street or highway.
Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway
right-of-way, the city council may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of
such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, such as
for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate
districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of
approach grades and future grade separations.
602.08 Street jogs: Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet
shall be prohibited.
602.09 Dead end streets: Minor terminal or dead-end streets or courts which are designed so as to
have one end permanently closed shall not be longer the six hundred (600) feet and shall be
provided at the closed end with a turn-around having a radius at the outside of the pavement of
at least forty (40) feet and a right-of-way radius of at least fifty (50) feet.
602.10 Street names: Proposed streets, which are in alignment with other already existing and
named streets, shall bear the names of such existing streets. The name of a proposed street,
which is not in alignment with an existing street, shall not duplicate the name of any existing
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 21
street, irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, lane,
road, pike, highway, parkway, or similar suffix.
Whenever a street alignment changes direction more than forty-five (45) degrees without a return
to the original alignment within a distance of five hundred (500) feet, then the name of the street
shall be changed at the point of curvature.
Whenever a cul-de-sac street serves not more than three (3) lots, the name of the intersecting
street shall apply to the cul-de-sac.
To avoid duplication and confusion, the proposed names of all streets shall be approved by city
council as part of its approval of the final plat prior to such names being assigned or used.
602.11 Private streets: New private streets may be created within any subdivision within the
corporate limits of the city or proposed to be platted as an addition to the city or be otherwise
annexed by the city. In subdivisions which are outside of the corporate limits of the city and
which are not to be platted as an addition to the city or be otherwise annexed by the city, all new
streets shall be private streets, described as public access easements. All private streets shall
be designed and constructed with the same specifications as a public street.
602.12 Site distance at intersections: The following shall be required as part of the restrictive
covenants on all final plats.
A. No fence, wall, hedge, tree or shrub planting which obstructs sight lines at elevations
between two and one-half (2.5) and eight (8) feet above the street, shall be placed or
permitted to remain on any corner lot within the triangular area formed by the street right-ofway
lines and a line connecting points (25 feet for local streets or fifty (50) feet for a collector
or arterial street) from the intersection of said street lines, or in the case of a rounded property
corner, from the intersection of the street right-of-way lines extended.
602.13 Visibility requirements: Minimum horizontal visibility measured on inside travel lane center
line shall be three hundred fifty (350) feet on arterial streets, two hundred seventy-five (275) feet
on collector streets, and two hundred (200) feet on local and other minor streets.
Section 603. - Alleys.
Alleys shall be provided to give access to the rear of all lots used for commercial and industrial
purposes, only in the event that private service drives cannot be provided. Alleys shall not be provided in
residential subdivisions except in cases where the subdivider produces evidence of the need for alleys
which is acceptable to the city council. The minimum width of an alley shall be twenty (20) feet. Alley
intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, corners shall be cut
off sufficiently to permit safe vehicular movement. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided and if such dead-end
alleys occur, such shall be equipped with a turnaround with a minimum radius of twenty-five (25) feet.
Section 604. - Blocks.
The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to the provision of
adequate access and circulation, building sizes suitable to the needs of the use contemplated, zoning
requirements regarding minimum lot sizes, widths and frontages and the limitations of opportunities
presented by the topography. Block lengths, except in unusual circumstances, shall not exceed one
thousand two hundred (1,200) feet.
Section 605. - Lots.
605.01 General: The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation shall be appropriate for the location
of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated.
605.02 Lot dimensions: Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of the applicable zoning
district. Residential lots not served by a public sewer where soil percolation rates and
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 22
topography meet the requirements of Title 124 of the Nebraska Department of Environmental
Quality, shall be required to have a minimum lot area of three (3) acre, a minimum lot width of
one hundred (100) feet and a minimum lot frontage of seventy-five (75) feet to protect against
health hazards of on-site sewage disposal and potential contamination of nearby wells. (Refer
to Section 711.01 of this ordinance.)
605.03 Corner lots: Corner lots for residential use shall have additional width to permit the required
minimum front yard setback distances on both frontages, while maintaining adequate buildable
area and orientation of the residential structure to one or both streets.
605.04 Access to lots: The subdividing of land shall be such as to provide each lot with satisfactory
vehicular access by means of a public street or approved private street.
605.05 Double frontage and reverse frontage lots: Double frontage and reverse frontage lots, shall
be avoided, except where essential to provide separation of residential development from
arterial streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography. Where such lots are used
in relation to an arterial street, a landscape screen easement of at least ten (10) feet in width
shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such arterial street and the subdivider shall
install trees, shrubbery or fences or a combination thereof to screen the residential development
from the arterial street and dampen the noise generated by traffic on the arterial streets.
605.06 Angle of side lot lines: Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street
lines, except in cases, determined by the city council, where odd land configuration or
topography would dictate creation of lots with side lot lines at substantial variation with this
limitation.
605.07 Setback lines: Minimum building setback (yard) lines on lots shall be as regulated by the yard
provisions of the applicable zoning district. Where the subdivider desires setback distances in
excess of the minimum setback stipulated in the zoning district, such shall be indicated on the
final plat.
Section 606. - Sidewalks.
606.01 General: Sidewalks shall be labeled upon the improvement plans and installed by the
subdivider (or city in the event of approval of financial participation by the City in accordance
with the conditions of Section 712.05 of this ordinance and creation of an assessment district) in
every subdivision, except where unusual conditions exist which eliminate the need for sidewalks
and an exception to eliminate all or a portion of the sidewalk construction requirement is
recommended by the planning commission and approved by the city council as part of the final
plat approval process.
606.02 Standards: Sidewalks shall be installed in all subdivisions within the boundaries of a plat
regardless of the use of land in the subdivision and such sidewalks shall be installed according
to the following standards:
A. Along both sides of all streets within the subdivision, in which case the edge of the sidewalk
nearest to the street shall normally be placed five (5) feet from the back of the street curb or,
where no curb exists, from the edge of the street pavement. Sidewalks abutting the curb or
pavement of any street shall be prohibited. Sidewalks may meander to avoid removal of
trees or to take advantage of more easily traversed topography by pedestrians, but in no
event shall such meandering result in the edge of the sidewalk nearest the street to be closer
than the aforementioned five (5) feet minimum distance.
B. All sidewalks shall extend to the street pavement at all intersections and at mid-block
crossings where appropriate and shall be equipped with handicap access ramps.
C. In neighborhoods planned as cluster developments, sidewalk locations may be adjusted to
accommodate the most efficient pedestrian circulation through and to and from the
development, including sidewalks in rear yards and elsewhere to accomplish such efficiency
in pedestrian movement.
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 23
D. The planning commission may recommend modifications to and the city council may modify
the requirements of this section, but only in instances where park, railroads, extreme
topographical conditions or other unusual conditions, excluding use of the property, make
sidewalk installation non-essential or unnecessary on both sides of the street. In any
subdivisions under the jurisdiction of the city where lot sizes equal or exceed one (1) acre
and average lot frontages exceed two hundred (200) feet, the planning commission may
recommend and the city council may grant an exception to all or some of this sidewalk
installation requirement.
E. The minimum sidewalk width shall be four (4) feet on local, collector and minor arterial streets
and five (5) feet on major arterial streets, provided however, that in multiple family residential
developments and non-residential subdivisions said sidewalks shall be of a width suitable
for the anticipated pedestrian traffic, but not less than four (4) feet, as determined by the city
council.
Section 607. - Flood and topographic hazard areas.
Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically unsuitable for residential or other
development shall not be platted for such purposes. Such land may be included in a subdivision and be set
aside on the plat for such uses as will be compatible with the hazards associated with the flooding or
erosion. The city council shall require that any building lot situated in a flood prone area be elevated a
minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-year flood elevation in accordance with the requirements of the
zoning ordinance and the Federal Flood Hazard Insurance Program.
Section 608. - Easements.
Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where
necessary. Such easements alongside yards shall be a minimum of sixteen (16) feet while easements along
rear lot lines shall be twenty (20) feet. Such easements shall generally be centered on the lot lines.
Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course or drainageway, a drainage easement shall be
provided, and such easement shall conform substantially with the lines of such water course or drainageway
and have such further width as will be adequate for the purpose of retaining the water handling capacity of
the water course or drainageway.
Where a subdivision contains streets with a right-of-way width of less than fifty (50) feet, utility
easements which are at least ten (10) feet in width shall be provided just outside of each side of the rightof-
way lines of any such streets.
(Ord. No. 2607-04, § 1, 5-17-04)
Section 609. - Community assets.
In all subdivisions, due regard shall be shown for natural features such as trees, unusual rock or
topographic formations, water courses, and any sites having historic significance, which if preserved, would
add attractiveness and value to the area. The city council shall have the authority to require preservation
of such natural or historic features as it deems reasonable.
Section 610. - Reservation/dedication of public land and open space.
Before preliminary or final plat approval is given, the planning commission may recommend and the
city council may require the subdivider to reserve sites for parks, playgrounds, open space, schools and
other public uses consistent with the comprehensive plan of the city, as recommended by the planning
commission and determined by the city council. Reservation of land for public acquisition and/or use shall
be for a period of time not to exceed two (2) years from the date the final plat wherein such reserved area
is located is recorded unless otherwise provided in this ordinance. If such reserved site is not acquired by
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 24
the city or other governmental entity within said two (2) year period, the subdivider may then resubdivide
the site or alternative purposes and sell any or all of such site.
Where a park, playground, school, or other site for public use, indicated in the comprehensive plan, is
located in whole or in part in an area proposed to be subdivided the city council may require immediate
acquisition of such site by the city or other governmental entity or accept the dedication of such area.
Section 611. - Reserved.
Section 612. - Dedication.
Final plat approval shall be subject to acceptance of any dedication of streets and alleys by the city
council. If dedication of such streets and alleys is not accepted by the city council and are to be developed
as private streets, or if the subdivision is located outside the corporate limits of the city and is not being
platted as an addition to the city or will be immediately annexed by the city, the subdivider shall make
adequate provision, as determined by the city council, for an owner's association with direct responsibility
to and control by the property owners of the subdivision to provide for the proper maintenance of all such
private streets and alleys, the removal of debris and the timely removal of snow therefrom so as to maintain
adequate access at all times for fire, police, sanitation, utility and emergency vehicles. Legal assurances
shall be provided which show that the association shall be self-perpetuating and has the authority to collect
assessments upon owners of land in the subdivision to accomplish the required street and alley
maintenance.
Such provisions shall also provide for agreement of the property owners within the subdivision, that if
the city or other government entity is requested or required to perform any maintenance or snow removal
from such private streets or alleys in order to maintain adequate access, said owners shall pay the costs
thereof to the city and that if not paid within ninety (90) days of billing by the city, the same shall become a
lien upon all properties within the subdivision until such costs are paid in full.

underground wiring and appropriate easements for such wiring as indicated on the approved final plat.
Section 710. - Drainage.
A drainage system, including pipes, inlets, drainage structures, bridges, ditches, detention cells and other
structures shall be designed and constructed by the subdivider to provide for proper drainage of surface
water of the subdivision and the drainage area of which it is a part of. The storm sewer system shall be
constructed and installed to provide for adequate drainage.
Storm drainage, including drain tile around basements and discharge from basement sump pumps shall
not be permitted to discharge into any sanitary sewer facility, but shall be connected to an adequate
drainage outlet.
710.01. The subdivider shall submit, a drainage report prepared by a registered professional engineer
licensed in the State of Nebraska describing the existing and proposed drainage conditions. A Preliminary
Drainage Report shall be included with the Preliminary plat. The Final Drainage Report shall be submitted
with the Final Plat and shall include an evaluation of the ability of the proposed improvements pertaining to
drainage in the subdivision to handle the run-off. The report shall also consider the impacts of the upstream
and downstream drainage systems.
The Preliminary Drainage Report shall include:
A. Preliminary estimates of the quantity of storm water entering the subdivision naturally and
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 28
upon full development of lots within the subdivision for a 2-year, 10-year and 100-year
frequency storm events.
B. Existing conditions of the watershed that may affect the proposed subdivision, such as soil
type, drainage channels, obstructions, flood plain, floodway, wetlands, etc.
C. A preliminary grading plan illustrating the proposed drainage improvements and storm
water management.
The Final Drainage Report shall include:
A. Calculations of the quantity of storm water entering the subdivision naturally and estimates
of such storm water upon full development within the subdivision based on the proposed
zoning.
B. Quantities of flow at each pick-up point.
C. Estimates and type of erosion control measures necessary to control erosion during
construction.
D. A description of an adequate drainage system within the subdivision and its design
capacities based on a 2-year, 10-year and 100-year frequency storm events.
In determining the size or type of storm sewer system, the design shall be sufficient to handle the computed
runoff based on the Nebraska Department of Roads “Drainage Design and Erosion Control Manual, latest
addition” and the Rational Method as described in said document. No storm sewer pipe shall be less than
18” in diameter. All storm sewers shall be designed to allow for a minimum of 12” between the bottom of
the pavement slab to the top of said storm sewer pipe.
Based on the findings of the Drainage Reports, improvements shall be made to limit the peak rate of storm
water discharge from the subdivision. Post development runoff (cubic feet per second) shall reflect a “no
net” increase in runoff based on 2-year, 10-year and 100-year frequency storm events. Pre-development
shall be the condition prior to improvements being completed, including cultivated row crops. Storm routing
shall be performed as described in Technical Release 55 “Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds” prepared
by the US Department of Agriculture and the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The city shall
require retention or detention basins (storage facilities) or other flow attenuation or reduction method in
order to control the post-development run-off. All temporary stored runoff shall be drained within 48 hours.
The outlet works of any storage facility shall include a principal outlet as well as an emergency overflow.
Flow through the emergency overflow must be demonstrated to discharge in a safe manner. Outlet works
must operate without requiring attendance or operation. During the design and construction of any storage
facility public safety shall be the highest concern. Consideration shall be made for fencing, flattening
approach slopes or other safety measures.
710.02 Drainage requirements: The subdivider shall provide adequate drainage facilities within the
subdivision including storm sewers determined to be necessary by the city council upon
recommendation of the city's engineer. If storm sewers are not necessary all open ditches shall
be graded and all pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, headwalls, gutters
and similar or related installations necessary to provide adequate surface water drainage shall
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 29
be constructed and installed in accordance with plans approved by the city council upon
recommendation by the city's engineer.
710.03 Drainage system standards:
A. All streets shall be provided with an adequate storm drainage system of curbs, gutters and
storm sewers or side ditches.
B. Curb drainage inlets shall be provided at appropriate intervals along streets with curbs and
gutter drainage. Where inlets connect to storm sewers a drain inlet structure and a protective
grating shall be installed.
C. All streets having curb and gutter on which storm water flows across intersections shall be
provided with concrete cross gutters at such intersections.
D. All off-street drainage swales and ditches shall be protected by drainage easements noted
on the final plat. Where water courses would cross lots diagonally, the subdivider shall
straighten such course and shall substantially follow lot lines.
Section 711. - Utility installation.
Utilities shall be designed and constructed for all lots in the proposed subdivision. Utilities shall be
provided in rear lot easements wherever possible. When it is necessary to install such utility in a street
right-of-way, such shall be installed after grading is completed and approved and before any pavement
base is applied. All in-street underground construction, water mains, sewer mains, gas mains, electrical
power, cable television, etc., and all service connections shall be completely installed through and across
the street. Where the utility mains and lines are outside of the area to be paved, installations of service
connections may be omitted, provided that at such time as these connections are needed, they may be
drilled across the street without breaking or weakening of the street pavement.
Where rock is known to exist beneath the street pavement is at such depth as to interfere with the
drilling of service connections, the complete installation of the service connections before paving of the
street shall be required. In cases where underground utilities must be provided within a street right-of-way,
such shall not be installed under the street paving unless specifically authorized by the city.

Section 712. - Shared improvement costs.
712.01 Oversize and off-site improvements: The utilities, street pavement and other improvements
required for the proposed subdivision may be required by city council to be oversized or
extended to serve nearby land or anticipated future development. This determination shall be
made at the sole discretion of the city council, upon recommendation by the planning
commission and in consultation with the zoning administrator and the city engineer.
712.02 Cost of oversize improvements: Minimum street pavement widths for all streets in a
subdivision shall conform to the standards established in Schedule A of this ordinance.
Minimum utility sizes shall be determined by the standards of the city and this ordinance with
regard to providing service to the subdivision in question. Where pavement widths or larger

712.04 Off-site extensions: If a subdivision contains lots less than one (1) acre in size and streets or
utilities are not available at the boundary of the proposed subdivision or within the distances or
costs established in Sections 611 and 612 of this ordinance and city council determines that
extensions of public water and/or sewer mains across undeveloped land are not warranted, the
subdivider, if he/she wishes to proceed, shall pay the cost of such off-site improvements and
provide for appropriate off-site easements prior to approval of the final plat for such subdivision.
Such improvements shall be available for use by subdividers of adjoining lands, except that
such subdividers shall pay to the city an amount equivalent to the cost of construction of such
off-site improvements and the city shall pay such amount to the subdivider who installed such
off-site improvements.
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 33
712.05 City participation: If the city council determines that it is advisable that a proposed subdivision
be accepted and that:
A. The subdivision shall be platted as an addition to the city, or will be otherwise annexed to
the city.
B. The expenditure of public funds, in addition to any such expenditure normally provided by
the city by the city, would be in the interest of the economic development of the city because
the type of development proposed in the subdivision addresses a need of the city with regard
to maintaining and/or enhancing the strength of the city's economy and enhancing the tax
base.
C. The reasonableness of the costs of such improvements and the prospect of the city
recovering the costs of any such improvements and the engineering cost thereof through
assessment districts, property and sales taxes, service fees, or other legal means within a
reasonable period of time, with a maximum time frame being fifteen (15) years. (See
restriction on assessment of costs, Section 713.03 of this ordinance.
D. The subdivision is consistent with the prioritized growth areas of the city, as indicated in the
City's Comprehensive Plan (Future Land Use Plan and Annexation Areas), and there will be
a benefit to surrounding subdivisions in existence or proposed, with regard to the benefits of
street extensions, utility extensions and drainage improvements.
E. The subdivision can be adequately served by water, sewer, electrical and natural gas utilities
without undue expenditures of public funds to extend services or expand capacities of such
utilities.
F. The city has the financial ability to pay such costs without undue impact on the budget of the
city.
G. The subdivision will not place undue burdens on the city for provision of law enforcement,
fire protection, ambulance and rescue and other services of the city.
The city may agree to pay for, finance or provide any part of the required improvements, as
determined by the city council.
Section 713. - Subdivision improvement guarantees.
Prior to recordation of any final plat approval, but after approval of the final plat and all subdivision
improvement plans and specifications, the subdivider shall complete all improvements required for the
subdivision. The final plat shall not be recorded until all improvements have been inspected and determined
to be in accordance with the approved plans and specifications and until dedication of all appropriate
improvements and acceptance thereof by the city council. In lieu of completion of construction of all
improvements prior to final plat recordation, the city council may enter into an agreement with the subdivider
whereby the subdivider shall guarantee to complete all improvements required by the city and this
ordinance. To secure such an agreement, the subdivider shall provide, subject to approval and acceptance
of the city council, one (1) or more of the guarantees set forth below:
713.01 Surety performance bond: The subdivider shall obtain a performance bond from a bonding
company authorized to do business in the State of Nebraska and acceptable to the city council.
The bond shall be payable to the city and shall be in an amount of one hundred ten (110)
percent of the estimated cost of all improvements required to be installed by the subdivider. The
estimated cost of such improvements shall be subject to review of the city engineer and
approval of the city council. The duration of the bond shall be until such time as the
improvements required to be installed by the subdivider have been installed, inspected and
accepted by the city council in accordance with section 714.07 of this ordinance.
713.02 Escrow account: The subdivider shall deposit cash or other instrument readily convertible to
cash at face value, either with the city or in escrow at a bank. The use of any instrument other
than cash and the bank to hold such escrow shall be subject to approval by the city council. The
amount of the escrow shall be equal to one hundred ten (110) percent of the estimated cost of
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 34
all improvements required to be installed by the subdivider. The estimated cost of such
improvements shall be subject to review of the city engineer and approval of the city council.
The subdivider shall file with the city council an escrow agreement between the bank and
himself/herself guaranteeing the following:
A. That the funds in such escrow account shall be held in trust until released by the city and
may not be used or pledged by the subdivider as security for any other matter during the
period such funds are held in escrow.
B. That in the event of failure of the subdivider to satisfactorily install all improvements required
of him/her, the bank shall immediately make the funds of such escrow account available to
the city for use in the completion of construction of such improvements.
C. As improvements are made by the subdivider and inspected and approved by the city, the
amount of escrow may be reduced accordingly, provided that at no time shall be amount
held in escrow be less than one hundred ten (110) percent of the estimated cost of
improvements which have not been installed or accepted.
713.03 Improvement (assessment) district: Due to the fact that the city wishes to encourage new
subdivision development in the city, but that it does not wish to place or assume unnecessary
financial risks for the taxpayers of the city, which would result from direct payment for
improvements, the creation of such improvement (assessment) districts for new subdivisions
may be utilized whenever the city council shall determine that the resulting assessments would
be consistent with the council's findings in Section 712.05 herein. Further to minimize the city's
financial risk associated with a subdivider’ s default on the assessment payments, the use of
such improvement (assessment) districts in relation to new subdivision development shall be
limited as follows:
A. The subdivider and the city council shall agree on the number of lots to be included in each
final plat phase of the subdivision to relate the number of lots to be developed with a
reasonable expectation that such lots can be sold within a period not exceeding five (5)
years; or
2. The subdivider shall provide a personal financial guarantee for the cost of subdivision
improvements for which he/she shall be responsible and provide such documentation
regarding the financial ability of the subdivider in association with said guarantee that is
acceptable to the city council.
713.04 Time limits: Prior to granting of a final plat approval, the subdivider and the city council shall
agree upon a deadline for the completion of all subdivision improvements to be installed. Such
deadline shall not exceed two (2) years from the date of final plat approval, provided however,
the city council may extend that deadline for one (1) additional year when the subdivider
presents good cause for such extension and provides any additional surety made necessary
due to inflation or increased cost of completing such improvements.
The city, if financial participation in the development of the subdivision in accordance with
conditions of Section 712.05 of this ordinance for street paving and sidewalk construction and
related improvements, may delay the actual street, sidewalk and related improvement
construction for up to a period of three (3) years from the date of final plat approval by the city
council in an effort to reduce such street paving and sidewalk and related improvements
construction cost by potentially combining a number of assessment districts resulting in a larger
construction project. In the event such street paving, sidewalk construction and related
improvements in an assessment district is to be delayed, the subdivider shall place, on the final
plat document, a restriction on all lots within the subdivision included in said assessment district
which states that all lots, by prior agreement of the subdivider, are subject to assessments for
street paving, construction of sidewalks and any other improvements included in such
assessment district and that the owners of lots within the subdivision shall, at the time of
construction and assessment of the improvements, agree to such assessments and shall not
have any right to petition against the said assessments.
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 35
713.05 Failure to complete improvements: If any construction of any improvements required to be
installed by the subdivider are not completed and accepted for dedication in compliance with
Section 713.07 below within the required time period, either for reason of non-completion or for
reason of substandard and unacceptable construction, the city council shall take one (1) of the
following actions:
A. Where improvements have been guaranteed under Section 713.01 of this ordinance, the
guarantee shall be forfeited to the city and the city shall use the proceeds from such
guarantee to complete all improvements remaining to be installed.
2. Where improvements have been guaranteed under Section 713.02 of this ordinance, the city
shall declare whatever security that has been pledged as a guarantee to be forfeited and the
city shall use the proceeds from such guarantee to complete all improvements remaining to
be installed.
713.06 Default on improvement (assessment) district payments: Should the subdivider have
provided a personal guarantee in association with an improvement (assessment) district and
should the subdivider than default on payment of such assessments, the city shall initiate action
to attach and collect such personal guarantee and use all proceeds therefrom to complete all
improvements remaining to be installed.
713.07 Inspection and acceptance of improvements: The zoning administrator, the city engineer and
any other authorized official of the city shall regularly inspect construction of the required
improvements. Upon completion of improvements, the zoning administrator, the city engineer
and such other authorized official shall file with the city council a statement either certifying that
the improvements have been satisfactorily completed or that defects in such improvements
exist and the statement shall list all specific defects and actions appropriate to eliminate such
defects. If defects exist, the city council shall require the subdivider to eliminate all such defects
within the time limits established for such improvements set forth in this ordinance.
Upon satisfactory completion of all improvements, the subdivider shall file with the city council, a
signed statement stipulating the following:
A. That all required improvements have been installed and are complete and that all required
improvements are in compliance with the minimum standards specified by the city.
B. That the subdivider knows of no defect in any improvement and that all required
improvements are free and clear from any encumbrance or lien.
If the zoning administrator, the city engineer or any other authorized official has certified that all
required improvements are complete and free from defect, the city council shall accept any
dedication of such improvements. The city council may accept the dedication of any portion of
the improvements provided that all statements and agreements specified above shall have been
received for the affected portion of the improvements.
714.08 Release of guarantees: Upon acceptance, in accordance with Section 713.07 above, the city
council shall authorize the release of any outstanding surety or guarantee provided by the
subdivider.
Section 714. - Operation and maintenance of improvements.
Unless specifically agreed by the city council, it is the intention of the city to provide no services other
than planning, zoning and subdivision regulation administration, other than the provision of water and sewer
utilities when authorized by the city council in accordance with the conditions of Section 712.05 of this
ordinance, to the land area within the jurisdictional area of the city, but outside the corporate limits of the
city. It shall therefore be the responsibility of the subdivider to present to the planning commission and city
council a precise approach for the operation and maintenance of streets and other subdivision
improvements within a subdivision so located outside of the corporate limits of the city at the time of request
for final plat approval that annexation to the city is not feasible. Such approach shall include the formation
and perpetuation of an owner's association or other method for generating the finances necessary for the
May 7, 2018 – Updated August 5, 2019 Page 36
proper maintenance and operation of the streets and other improvements within the subdivision. Such
approach shall be binding on the subdivider in a form, agreement or contract acceptable to the city council.
