PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Black Mountain, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1993 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the town board of aldermen. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1993 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel F. Walker, Code Attorney, and Kyle Meyer, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Darlene Whisenant, Town Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

Any dog or cat which appears to be lost, stray or unwanted, or which is found to be not wearing a currently valid rabies vaccination tag, as required by state law or this chapter and not under restraint in violation of this chapter, shall be impounded by the department and confined in the county animal shelter in a humane manner. Impoundment of such an animal shall not relieve the custodian thereof from any penalty which may be imposed for violation of this article.

Immediately upon impounding an animal, the animal shelter attendant shall make a reasonable effort to notify the owner and inform such owner of the condition whereby the animal may be redeemed, which shall include inspection of the animal for microchip or tattoo.

b.  Payment for rabies vaccination will be the responsibility of the person redeeming or adopting the animal. 
(6)  Suspected rabid animals not to be redeemed or adopted. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, animals impounded which appear to be suffering from rabies shall not be redeemed or adopted, but shall be dealt with in accordance with this chapter and applicable state law. 
(7)  Destruction of wounded or diseased animals. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any animal impounded that is badly wounded or diseased and has no identification may be destroyed immediately in a humane manner.

If the vehicle is registered in the state, notice shall be given within 24 hours. If the vehicle is not registered in the state, notice shall be given to the registered owner within 72 hours from the removal of the vehicle.

    The purpose of this article is to develop procedures for the regulation and monitoring of outdoor lighting in those areas currently zoned C-1, C-2, C-3, I-1, I-2, ICD, O-I, TND and MU. This article is intended to reduce the problems created by improperly designed and installed outdoor lighting in the industrial, commercial, office and institutional zoned areas of the town. It is intended to eliminate problems of glare, minimize light trespass, and help reduce the energy and financial costs of outdoor lighting by establishing regulations which limit the area that certain kinds of outdoor lighting fixtures can illuminate and by limiting the total allowable illumination of lots located in the town. All business, residential, and community driveway, sidewalk, and property luminaires should be installed with the idea of being a "good neighbor," with attempts to keep unnecessary direct light from shining onto abutting properties or streets.

Chapter 38 - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
State Law reference- Regulatory options available to local governments concerning sexually oriented businesses, G.S. 160A-181.1. 

Sec. 38-1. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this chapter shall be to set forth the regulatory and licensing requirement for adult establishments located within the town. Adult establishments, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics. Studies and experiences that are relevant to the state have shown that lower property values and increased crime rates tend to accompany and are brought about by adult establishments. The board of aldermen finds that regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that the adverse secondary effects do not contribute to the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods and to regulate acts, omissions or conditions detrimental to the health, safety or welfare and the peace and dignity of the town. Regulation to achieve these purposes can be accomplished by the procedures set forth herein. 
(b)  The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. This chapter represents a balancing of the legitimate ends of the community by imposing an incidental, content-neutral place, time and manner of regulation of sexually oriented businesses, without limiting alternative avenues of communication, and, at the same time, requiring the business to carry its share of financing, administrative and enforcement activities.

Sec. 48-169. - Complaints; adjustments. 
(a)  If the consumer believes his bill to be in error, the claim shall be presented in person at the town's office before the bill becomes delinquent.

(c)  The town shall have the discretion to adjust billing charges to any customer as follows: 
(1)  Account adjustments. Accounts will be adjusted when a numerical error as determined by the town is made in the account, crediting payments, calculating charges and the like. 
(2)  Leakage adjustments. Billing charges on the accounts of metered service may be adjusted by the town if the meter registers water usage not actually consumed because of a leak on the customer's side of the meter. If the town determines that there is no fault on the part of the customer precipitating the leakage, a billing adjustment not to exceed 75 percent of all water usage in excess of the customer's normal water usage may be made. No billing adjustment will be made in cases where the total adjustment will result in an amount equal to or less than $10.00. A customer's normal water usage shall be calculated on the basis of the customer's average water consumption for the lesser of: 
a.  The 12-month period preceding the month in which the leak occurred; or 
b.  The period commencing with the month when the meter was installed and a bill issued up to the month in which the leak occurred. 
Said adjustment in the billing charges is conditioned upon a repair of the leak by the customer within 30 days of detecting the leak and a return to normal of the consumption rate. The town may require proof that the leak has been repaired. The billing adjustment is limited to a 60-day period maximum, which 60-day period shall consist of 30 days prior to the detection of a leak and 30 days after the detection of a leak. 
(3)  Adjustments for meter inaccuracy. If a meter shall have become inaccurate as determined by the town, water service shall be charged based on estimated consumption calculated on the basis of the previous consumption for the lesser of 12 months or the length of time said meter was in place. The account adjustment shall apply for the period during which it may appear to the town such meter inaccuracy may have been continued. 
(4)  No cause or reason found for error. If the town cannot determine what the cause or reason is for the billing error, then the town may adjust the billing charges in such amounts as the town may deem to be fair under all the circumstances, but not less than a charge based on a customer's normal water usage as specified in subsection (c)(2) of this section.

SECTION 1.1 - TITLE, AUTHORITY, PURPOSE, SEPARABILITY AND APPLICATION 

1.1.1 - Title. 
    This code is adopted by reference in appendix A of the Town of Black Mountain Code of Ordinances and shall be known as the land use code for the Town of Black Mountain. 
1.1.2 - Authority and jurisdiction. 
    These regulations are adopted pursuant to the authority granted by the North Carolina General Statutes (NCGS), Article 19; Sections 160A-381 through 160A-392. The provisions of this code shall be applicable to all property within the town limits and its extra-territorial jurisdiction. 
1.1.3 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  The purpose of this title [appendix] of the Black Mountain Code of Ordinances is to provide regulations for the subdivision of land and guidelines for its development, in order to protect and promote the health, safety and general welfare of the town and any of its extraterritorial jurisdictions in accordance with the General Statutes of the State of North Carolina and the Town of Black Mountain Code of Ordinances. It is also the intent of the Town of Black Mountain Board of Alderman that the land use development code implement the planning policies reflected in the town's adopted comprehensive plan and other current, adopted planning documents, and that these regulations be easy to understand and that all processes required be simple and efficient. 
B.  These policies are intended to protect individual property values and development rights while: 
1.  Maintaining the small town character and community identity of the town; 
2.  Promoting social, cultural and economic diversity in our community; 
3.  Promoting a vibrant downtown district that encourages small business development and preserves the historical integrity of the existing buildings; 
4.  Providing a network of safe and convenient transportation options that accommodate freight, automobiles, transit vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists; 
5.  Preserving our natural resources, parks, open spaces, and view-sheds; 
6.  Minimizing risk to property and water quality from flood damage and stormwater; 
7.  Protecting environmental health and safety from natural and manmade disasters; 
8.  Providing a variety of housing types for citizens of all income levels, ages and physical abilities; and 
9.  Creating economic opportunities through organized development patterns that encourage investment and the redevelopment of blighted areas. 
1.1.4 - No use or sale of land or buildings except in conformity with ordinance provisions. 
A.  Regulations set forth shall be considered minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or land except as specifically provided for elsewhere within the land use code. 
B.  No person may use, occupy, or sell any land or buildings or authorize or permit the use, occupancy, or sale of land or buildings under his/her control except in accordance with all of the applicable provisions of this ordinance. 
C.  For purposes of this section, the "use" or "occupancy" of a building or land relates to anything and everything that is done to, on, or in that building or land. 
1.1.5 - Relationship with adopted plans. 
    The administration, enforcement, and amendment of this ordinance shall be accomplished with consideration of recommendations presented in the town's comprehensive plan and other adopted planning documents, including but not limited to the town's capital improvement program, comprehensive pedestrian plan, greenways plan, the French Broad River MPO Comprehensive Transportation Plan, and other local and regional plans adopted or endorsed by the town board of aldermen. 
1.1.6 - Relationship with other regulations and existing ordinances. 
A.  When provisions of this ordinance require a greater width or size of yards, or require a lower height of a building, or require a greater percentage of a lot to be left unoccupied, or impose other higher standards than are required in any other statute or local ordinance or regulation, provisions of this code shall govern. When the provisions of any other statute or local ordinance or regulation require a greater width or size of yards, or require a lower height of a building, or require a greater percentage of a lot to be left unoccupied, or impose other higher standards than are required by the provisions made by this ordinance, the provisions of that statute or regulation shall govern. 
B.  To the extent that the provisions of this article are tied to specific zoning districts, these provisions will not supersede, repeal or replace the existing regulations until such time as they are located and adopted as amendments to the zoning map. Existing zoning district regulations will remain as part of the land use code until such time as they are formally removed from, or replaced on the zoning map through the map revision process. 
1.1.7 - Relationship with existing permits, vested rights currently effective, and applications and violations in process.

B.  It is not intended that this ordinance repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing building permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law and currently effective. 
C.  Variances, appeals, conditional use and special use permits, subdivision plans, site plan approvals, and other similar development approvals that are valid before the effective date of this ordinance will remain valid until their expiration date. Development may be completed in accordance with such approvals even if such building, development or structure does not fully comply with provisions of this ordinance. If building is not commenced and diligently pursued in the time allowed under the original approval or any extension granted, then the building, development or structure must meet the standards of this ordinance in effect at the time of re-application. 
D.  All suits at law or in equity and all prosecutions resulting from the violations of any zoning ordinance heretofore in effect which are pending in any of the courts of North Carolina or of the United States, shall be prosecuted to their finality, unless the act or structure which failed to comply with the prior ordinances being prosecuted is in compliance with this ordinance. 
1.1.8 - Separability. 
    If any section or specific provision of this ordinance or any regulating district boundary arising from it is found by a court to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the decision of the court shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other section, provision, standard, or district boundary of these regulations except the provision in question. The other portions of these regulations not affected by the decision of the court shall remain in full force and effect. Should any section or provision of this ordinance be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

B.  Authority to file applications. Applications under this article shall be submitted to the planning director by the owner, or any other person having a recognized interest in the land for which the development is proposed, or their authorized agent. 
1.  Applicant is not the owner. If applicant is not the owner of the land, or is a contract purchaser of the property, a letter signed by the owner consenting to the submission of the application shall be submitted. 
2.  Applicant is not the sole owner. If applicant is not the sole owner of the land, a letter signed by the other owners, an association representing the owners, or their authorized agent consenting to or joining in the application for approval shall be submitted. 
C.  Simultaneous processing. Whenever two or more forms of review and approval are required under this ordinance (e.g., a rezoning, development agreement or a special use permit), the applications for those development approvals may, at the option of the planning director, be processed simultaneously, so long as all applicable state and local requirements are satisfied for both applications. However, whenever this ordinance requires two types of review for the same approval (e.g., a master plan for subdivision and a final plat for subdivision), those two review and approval procedures must be completed as separate steps in the order specified. 
1.4.6 - Applications and technical review. 
A.  To minimize development planning costs, promote public safety, avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretation and ensure compliance with requirements, a pre-application consultation between applicants and the town staff with a sketch plan is encouraged for all projects and required for some to allow for technical review at the beginning of the planning process. 
B.  A pre-application consultation and technical review is required for: 
1.  Work impacting the exterior of any structure within historic or conservation districts; 
2.  Major and minor subdivisions; 
3.  Special use applications; 
4.  Conditional use applications; 
5.  Any work within a flood hazard area as indicated on the FIRM maps; 
6.  Projects within the ICD, OI or C-3 districts; or 
7.  Projects adjacent to US Highway 70 within the US70 overlay district. 
C.  A sketch or concept plan of the project should be prepared for the consultation, drawn approximately to scale (1 inch = 60 feet). Sketch plans for subdivisions, special use permits and institutional campus development have specific requirements. All other sketch plans shall contain at a minimum: 
1.  The name and address of the developer; 
2.  The proposed name and location of the subdivision; 
3.  The approximate total acreage of the proposed subdivision; 
4.  The tentative street and lot arrangement, including designation of driveways, parking lots, open space, greenways, and stormwater management areas; 
5.  Topographic lines and drainages; and 
6.  Other information believed necessary to obtain the opinion of the planning department staff as to the proposed subdivision's compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
D.  The planning director, zoning administrator, building inspector or other staff as appointed or invited by the planning director shall meet with the property owner or developer as soon as conveniently possible to review the sketch plan and to provide technical comments. Staff shall review the application and confer with the applicant to ensure that the applicable requirements have been met and that the application represents what the applicant proposes to do. Staff will then determine the necessary approval process and prepare recommendations or a report and documentation for advancing the project through the appropriate channels, such as the historic preservation commission, the planning board, and/or the zoning board of adjustment, or other board or commission. 
E.  The burden of presenting a complete application to the planning department or to the permit issuing board shall be upon the applicant. 
F.  Applications will not be forwarded on to a board or commission for consideration until such time as the application is complete and any required fees have been paid. 
G.  The burden of persuasion on the issue of whether the development, if completed as proposed, will comply with the requirements of this code remains at all times on the applicant. 
1.4.7 - Timing of submittals. 
    Any application, sketch plan, master plan, or plat that must go before the planning board, historic preservation commission or board of aldermen must be submitted at least 14 days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting in order to be placed on that meeting's agenda. The zoning board of adjustment, which does not have regularly scheduled meetings, will schedule hearings in response to applications in such a way as to meet all NCGS public notification requirements, usually within two to four weeks after a complete submittal is provided to the planning and development services department. 
1.4.8 - Uses of right. 
    Uses or categories of uses not designated as permitted by right or as conditional or special uses, shall be prohibited. Conditional and special uses are permitted upon compliance with additional regulations as set out in the town's ordinances and under any such additional conditions as specified by the board of adjustment. 
1.4.9 - Special use and conditional use permits. 
    Special use permits and conditional use permits are required for certain uses designated within the code in order to ensure the goals of the comprehensive plan or other adopted plans are considered and to minimize negative impacts on neighboring properties. These permits must be issued by the zoning board of adjustment which shall hear requests for all conditional and special use permits and consider permits in accordance with guidelines set forth. 
1.4.10 - Administrative and permit fees. 
    The board of aldermen may adopt a schedule of fees for permits and processing costs associated with the administration of the land use code (see appendix). 
A.  Fees to be paid. No application shall be processed until the established fee has been paid. 
B.  Refund of fees. Application fees are not refundable except where the planning director determines that an application was accepted in error, or the fee paid exceeded the amount due, in which case the amount of the overpayment will be refunded to the applicant, or if a project qualified for a rebate under the town's building regulations. 
C.  Waiver of fees. The planning director, with the approval of the town manager may waive or reduce fees for applications if the project is for a governmental or public purpose, if there is an emergency or hardship that has created the need for the project, or if there are other extenuating circumstances regarding the application which would reasonably warrant the waiving of fees.

SECTION 1.5 - AMENDMENTS 

1.5.1 - Amendments to the land use code text and the zoning map. 
A.  These land use regulations and the zoning map may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, modified or repealed by the board of aldermen after the following procedures and standards provided in this chapter have been met and in accordance with state statutes. 
B.  Reserved. 
C.  No text or map amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or shall first have been submitted to the planning board for review and recommendation. 
1.  For formal applications for a zoning map or text amendment submitted with all accompanying documentation and fees, the planning board shall have 30 days within which to submit its report. If the planning board fails to submit a report within the required 30-day period, it shall be deemed to have approved the proposed amendment and the application shall be advanced to the board of aldermen. 
2.  For informal requests or suggestions for zoning map or text amendments, the planning board does not have to respond within 30 days but shall take the matter into advisement in their deliberations and determine how and at what time the recommendation or request shall be handled. 
( Ord. No. O-16-03 , § 1, 3-14-2016) 
1.5.2 - Requirements for consideration of zoning map and text amendments. 
A.  The planning board and board of aldermen must consider the following in their consideration of any text or map amendments: 
1.  If the public necessity, convenience, general welfare, or good zoning practices justify such action, and 
2.  If the action is consistent with the town comprehensive plan or other adopted plans. 
B.  After the required review and report by the planning board, the board of aldermen may undertake the necessary steps to amend the land use code. 
1.5.3 - Reconsideration of zoning map amendments. 
    The board of aldermen shall not reconsider a proposed amendment to the zoning map for a period of six months from the date of the determination of the prior request; unless, the planning board recommends that reconsideration be given after there has been a substantial change of character to the area or evidence of factors or conditions exist which were not considered by the planning board or the board of aldermen in previous deliberations and which might substantially alter the basis upon which the previous determination was made. 
1.5.4 - Procedure for map or text amendments. 
A.  Board initiation of amendments. A proposed amendment to the text of the land use code or the zoning on the official zoning map may be initiated by the board of aldermen, the planning board, the zoning board of adjustment, or by recommendation of any town board or commission to the planning board. 
B.  Citizen petitions for amendments may be made by submitting an application form obtained from the planning department. Completed forms, plus any additional information the applicant feels to be pertinent, shall be filed with the planning department for staff to forward on to the planning board. The property owner or the holder of a conditional sales contract may request an amendment to the land use code for a particular piece of property. 
C.  Only completed applications will be considered. Applications or board recommendations received at least two weeks prior to the planning board meeting shall be heard at that meeting. Any communication purporting to be a petition for an amendment shall be regarded as notice to seek relief only or an informal recommendation to the planning board, until such time as the amendment petition is filed with the planning and development department. 
D.  Petitions for changes in zoning classification (or "rezonings") shall indicate the location, intended use of the site, and the names of all property owners and existing land uses within 200 feet of the petitioned property boundary. 
E.  Petition fees shall be established by the board of aldermen and the appropriate fee must accompany each application submitted. Application fees are nonrefundable except in any case where the petition is withdrawn prior to its consideration by the planning board. Recommendations for changes to the code text or map that come from town appointed boards or commissions shall not require a petition fee. 
F.  Proposed text and/or map changes shall be submitted to the planning board for review and recommendation. Before a map amendment is presented to the planning board, staff shall prominently post a notice of the public hearing on the site of the proposed rezoning or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way. When multiple parcels are included within a proposed zoning amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is not required but the town shall post enough notices in strategically visible locations so as to provide reasonable notice to interested persons. Additionally, the town shall provide notice by first class mail to all property owners within 200 feet of the property boundary of the proposed amendment and the date of the public hearing. If the zoning map amendment affects more than 50 properties, owned by a total of at least 50 different property owners, the board of aldermen may publish a notice of the hearing, provided that each advertisement shall not be less than one-half of a newspaper page in size as long as the property owners residing outside the newspaper circulation are still notified by mail. The planning board shall have 30 days within which to submit a recommendation to the board of aldermen with a statement of whether the proposed amendment is consistent with the comprehensive plan or other officially adopted plan applicable. If the planning board fails to act within the required 30-day period, it shall be deemed to support and recommend the proposed amendment and the application shall proceed to the board of aldermen. 
G.  The planning board makes a recommendation to the board of aldermen in writing that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate by the planning board. However, a comment by the planning board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan or other officially adopted plans shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the governing board. 
H.  Public hearing required. Before enacting an amendment to this code or official zoning map, the aldermen shall first hold a public hearing. Staff shall place notification of the public hearing. Staff shall place notification of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the Town of Black Mountain once a week for two successive calendar weeks. The notice shall be published the first time not less than ten days nor more than 25 days before the date fixed for the hearing. In computing such period, the day of publication is not to be included but the day of the hearing shall be included. Meeting notice shall include time and place of hearing. 
I.  Posting of property. When a zoning map amendment is proposed, staff shall prominently post a notice of the public hearing on the site of the proposed rezoning or on an adjacent street or highway right-of-way. When multiple parcels are included within a proposed zoning map amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is not required but the town shall post enough notices in strategically visible locations so to provide reasonable notice to interested persons. Additionally, the town shall provide notice by first class mail to all property owners within 200 feet of the property boundary of the proposed zoning map amendment and the date of the public hearing If the zoning map amendment affects more than 50 properties, owned by a total of at least 50 different property owners, staff may publish a notice of the hearing, provided that each advertisement shall not be less than one-half of a newspaper page in size as long as property owners residing outside the newspaper circulation area are still notified by mail. Notice shall also be posted on the town website indicating the date and time of the hearing. 
J.  Changes in the zoning map. Following final action by the board of aldermen, zoning designation changes will be considered immediate unless an alternate effective date is established by action of the board, and any necessary changes in the zoning map itself shall be made as soon as possible. A written record of the type and date of the changes shall be maintained by the planning department. 
K.  Written statement of consistency. Per G.S. 160A-383, in adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the governing board shall also adopt a statement describing whether its action is consistent with all applicable officially adopted plans and explaining why the board of aldermen consider the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest.

1.5.5 - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O-16-03 , § 1, adopted March 14, 2016, repealed former § 1.5.5 which pertained to protest petitions, and derived from Res. No. R-09-32, adopted Dec. 14, 2009. 
SECTION 1.6 - CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE AND OCCUPANCY REQUIRED 

1.6.1 - Certificate of compliance and occupancy required. 
A.  No building shall be used or occupied, or re-used or reoccupied, for commercial, institutional or industrial purposes, and no new residential construction shall be occupied until a certificate of compliance and occupancy, or "C.O." is obtained from the office of the building inspector or his/her designee, stating that the building, any building and/or site improvements, or the proposed use complies with the provisions of this ordinance. Any residences which are converted to any type of non-residential use are required by North Carolina State Law to have a building inspection done. Any converted building shall be required to comply with required site plan or building renovation permit submittal and to obtain a commercial certificate of occupancy. 
B.  Applications for a CO must be submitted to the building inspections office and shall be accompanied by a site plan, approved final plat, or other such plans and specifications as the building inspector, fire inspector and zoning administrator may require in order to render a decision regarding the conformity of the proposed use, reuse, construction or renovation, to the applicable regulations. 
C.  The CO shall be issued only when the building inspector, fire inspector and zoning administrator certify that the project is in compliance with applicable regulations and the site and building improvements have been completed in accordance with the previously submitted and approved plans. 
D.  The fire code official and the building inspector or their designees are authorized to post information of certificate of occupancy requirements and other building code information on vacant, unattended or abandoned premises in order to assist business owners in meeting the town occupancy requirements and to comply with the safety requirements of the NC fire code and the NC building code. Signs, tags or seals posted or affixed by the code official shall not be mutilated, destroyed, tampered with, or removed without authorization from the code official. 
SECTION 1.7 - APPEALS AND VARIANCES 

1.7.1 - General procedures. 
A.  Any persons or interested parties wishing to seek a variance shall file an appeal with the town planning and development department for a hearing with the zoning board of adjustment. Any persons or interested parties wishing to seek an appeal of a zoning interpretation or staff determination shall file an application with the town clerk for a hearing with the board of adjustment. 
B.  An application fee shall accompany each application for a variance and this fee shall be nonrefundable except in any case where the application is withdrawn prior to its consideration by the board of adjustment. There is no fee for an appeal. 
C.  Before filing the application, the applicant is strongly encouraged to meet with the planning director or zoning administrator to discuss the proposed variance or appeal and to become more familiar with the applicable requirements and approval procedures of the town. 
D.  Upon receipt of a complete application, the planning and development department shall forward the application to the zoning board of adjustment according to the following procedures: 
1.  The zoning board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing regarding applications once the completed application and accompanying fees are received by the planning and development department and upon proper notification (see below) for the next regularly scheduled zoning board of adjustment meeting. Special hearings may be scheduled at the direction of the zoning board of adjustment chair. 
2.  Staff shall place notification of the public hearing. Staff shall place notification of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the Town of Black Mountain once a week for two successive calendar weeks. The notice shall be published the first time not less than ten days nor more than 25 days before the date fixed for the hearing. In computing such period, the day of publication is not to be included but the day of the hearing shall be included. Meeting notice shall include time and place of hearing. 
3.  Notice of hearings shall be mailed to the person or entity whose appeal, application or request is the subject of the hearing; to the owner of the property that is in the subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing; to the owners of all parcels within 200 feet of the parcel of land that is subject of the hearing; and to any other persons entitled to receive notice as provided by the land use code. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the town may rely on the county tax listing to determine property owners of property entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least ten days but not more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within that same time period, the town shall prominently post a notice of the hearing on the site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street or highway right-of-way. 
4.  The concurring vote of four-fifths of the board of adjustment shall be necessary to grant a variance. A majority vote of the members shall be required for all other quasi-judicial matters or to overturn the decision of an administrative official. 
5.  The zoning board of adjustment shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating that fact; and shall keep record of its examinations and other official action, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the zoning administrator and shall be public record. 
6.  On all appeals, applications, matters, decisions and orders brought before the zoning board of adjustment, the zoning administrator shall deliver by certified mail, return receipt requested, personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail to the applicant, property owner, and to any person who has submitted a written request for a copy, prior to the date the decision becomes effective. The zoning administrator shall certify that proper notice has been made. 
E.  In the event that the zoning board of adjustment reverses or modifies the contested action, all subsequent actions taken by administrative officers with regard to the subject matter shall be in accordance with the reversal or modification granted by the board of adjustment unless an appeal is taken on the board's decision. 
F.  The applicant is responsible for presenting necessary data in written and verbal form in support of their appeal or variance, including but not limited to, historic information, environmental studies, scaled drawings, plans or photographs, and providing such materials to the town as part of the application package.

(Ord. No. O-11-01, § 1, 5-9-2011; Ord. No. O-14-09 , 9-8-2014; Ord. No. O-17-06 , § 1, 6-12-2017; Ord. No. O-19-03 , § 2, 1-14-2019) 
1.7.2 - Appeals of administrative decisions. 
A.  The zoning board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official charged with the enforcement of the town's land use code. 
1.  Any person who has standing under G.S. 160A-393(d) or the town may appeal a decision to the board of adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal with the town clerk. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for the appeal. 
2.  The official who made the decision shall give written notice to the owner of the property that is the subject of the decision and to the party who sought the decision, if different from the owner. The written notice shall be delivered by certified mail, return receipt requested, personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail. 
3.  The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the written notice within which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal shall 30 days from any source of actual or constructive notice of the decision within which to file an appeal. 
4.  It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to appeal have constructive notice of the decision from the date a sign containing the words "Zoning Decision" or "Subdivision Decision" in letters at least six inches high and identifying the means to contact an official for information about the decision is prominently posted on the property that is the subject of the decision, provided the sign remains on the property for at least ten days. Position of a sign is not the only form of constructive notice. Any such posting shall be the responsibility of the landowner or applicant. Verification of the posting shall be provided by the official who made the decision. 
5.  The official who made the decision shall transmit to the board all documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the applicant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner. 
6.  An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays the enforcement of the action appealed from unless the officials who made the decision certifies to the board of adjustment after notice of appeal has been filed that because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the ordinance. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the board of adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or otherwise affirming that proposed use of property is consistent with the ordinance shall not stay the further review of an application for permits or permissions to use such property; in these situations, the appellant may request that the board may grant a stay of a final decision of permit applications or building permits affected by the issue being appealed. 
7.  Subject to the provisions of subsection 6. of this section, the board of adjustment shall hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time. 
8.  The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in the notice of appeal. If any party or the town would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the board shall continue the hearing. The board of adjustment may reverse, affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to be made. The board shall have all of the powers of the official who made the decision. 
9.  When hearing an appeal pursuant to G.S. 160A-400.9(e) or any other appeal in the nature of certiorari, the hearing shall be based on the record below and the scope of review shall be as provided in G.S. 160A-393(k). 
10.  Any appeal from the decision of the board of adjustment may be made by an aggrieved party and may be made to the Superior Court of Buncombe County. Any such petition for certiorari the superior court shall be filed no later than 30 days after a written copy of the decision of the board of adjustment is delivered as provided in section 1.7.1.D.6. 
( Ord. No. O-14-09 , 9-8-2014) 
1.7.3 - Variances. 
A.  The board of adjustment shall authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of the town's land use code as will not be contrary to the public interest and where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of town ordinances will, in and individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship. Variances are intended to provide limited relief from regulations in those cases where strict application of a particular requirement will create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship prohibiting the use of land in a manner otherwise allowed under the land use code and in a way that the spirit of the town regulations shall be preserved, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. 
    It is not intended that variances be granted merely to remove inconvenience or financial burdens that requirements may impose on property owners in general or to increase the profitability of a proposed development. It is intended to provide relief where requirements render the land difficult or impossible to use because of some unique physical attribute of the property itself or other factor unique to the property for which the variance is requested. 
B.  The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, building or structures in the same district or of permitted or nonconforming uses in other districts shall not constitute a reason for a requested variance. 
C.  In no event shall the board of adjustment grant a variance which would: 
1.  Allow the establishment of a use which is not otherwise allowed in a zoning district or which would change the zoning district classification or the district boundary of the property in question. 
2.  Vary from the flood protection provisions within the designated floodway district in any way which would result in any increase in the flood levels during the regulatory flood discharge or threaten the public safety (see flood hazard protection ordinance concerning variances). 
3.  Conflict with the North Carolina State Building Code, the fire prevention code, or any other state code unless otherwise authorized by laws and regulations. 
4.  Permit the creation of a nonconforming lot. 
5.  Deviate from the sign regulations within the sign ordinance unless the requested variance is within the town's historic district or conservation district and the variance would further the goals of the town's historic preservation commission. 
D.  A variance may be granted in the individual case of unnecessary hardship upon the zoning board of adjustment being able to establish the following findings: 
1.  That unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property; 
2.  That the hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance; 
3.  That the hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship; 
4.  That the requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured and substantial justice is achieved. 
E.  After the board of adjustment approves a variance, the applicant shall follow all appropriate procedures set forth in these regulations for the receipt of permits, certificates, and other approvals necessary in order to proceed with development. 
( Ord. No. O-14-09 , 9-8-2014) 
1.7.4 - Decisions of the zoning board of adjustment. 
A.  The concurring vote of four-fifths of the board of adjustment shall be necessary to grant a variance. A majority of the members shall be required to decide any other quasi-judicial matter or to determine an appeal made in the nature of certiorari. 
B.  The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating that fact; and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the zoning administrator and shall be public record. 
C.  On all appeals, applications and matters brought before the zoning board of adjustment, the board shall inform the applicant, property owner, and any person who has submitted a written request for a copy, of its decision in writing, delivered by certified mail, return receipt requested, personal delivery, electronic mail, or first-class mail. 
( Ord. No. O-14-09 , 9-8-2014) 
1.7.5 - Appeals from decisions of the zoning board of adjustment. 
A.  Any person or entity of standing in any decision of the zoning board of adjustment may appeal the decision of the board to the Superior Court of Buncombe County and such appeal shall be in the nature of certiorari. 
B.  Appeals of the zoning board of adjustment decisions must be filed no later than 30 days after a written copy of the decision is delivered as provided in section 1.7.1.D.6 
( Ord. No. O-14-09 , 9-8-2014) 
1.7.6 - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O-15-05 , § 2, adopted April 13, 2015, repealed former § 1.7.6 which pertained to staff level variances for setbacks, and derived from the original codification. 
SECTION 1.8 - VESTED RIGHTS AND ANNEXATION 

1.8.1 - Vested rights. 
A.  A vested right is the right pursuant to G.S. 160A-385.1 to undertake and complete the development and use of property under the terms and conditions of an approved site specific development plan. In accordance with this statute, the town is authorized and required to identify the specific types of zoning or land use approvals that constitute such a site specific development plan. 
B.  A vested right as provided in this code shall remain vested for a period of five years pre-construction or as otherwise specifically and unambiguously provided by the appropriate authority at the time of approval.

1.8.2 - Vested rights relative to annexation. 
A.  A single or multiple tract development outside of the town's jurisdiction but seeking voluntary annexation may be issued a vested right upon the effective date of the town's action or ordinance relating thereto and as described in a preliminary plat or master plan approved by the town planning board and the board of aldermen. In such cases, the following also apply: 
1.  Such approval of a site specific development plan may contain a variance from the proposed zoning district or other terms and conditions as may reasonably be necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizen's of the town and of the prospective residents or businesses of the proposed development. 
2.  A petition for annexation filed with the Town of Black Mountain under G.S. 160A-31 or G.S. 160A-58.1 shall contain a signed statement declaring whether or not any zoning vested right with respect to the properties subject to the petition has been established under G.S. 160A-385.1 or G.S. 153A-344.1. 
3.  A statement that declares that no zoning vested right has been established under G.S. 160A-385.1 or G.S. 153A-344.1, or the failure to sign a statement declaring whether or not a zoning vested right has been established, shall be binding on the landowner and any such zoning vested right shall be terminated. 
B.  Following approval or conditional approval of a site specific development plan, nothing in this ordinance shall exempt such plan from subsequent reviews and approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original approval. Nothing in this code shall prohibit the revocation of the approval for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions of the approval or the zoning ordinance. A building permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the running of time while a zoning vested right under this section is outstanding. 
C.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither a variance, a sketch plan nor any other document that fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property, shall constitute a site specific development plan. 
D.  The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning that imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to the regulations of the Land Use Code by the Town of Black Mountain, including, but not limited to flood hazard prevention, building, fire, plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes and general regulations of the town. Otherwise applicable new or amended regulations shall become effective with respect to property that is subject to a site specific development plan upon the expiration or termination of the vested right in accordance with this ordinance. 
E.  A zoning vested right is not a personal right but shall attach to and run with the applicable property. After approval of a site specific development plan, all successors to the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such right while applicable. 
F.  A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this code shall terminate: 
1.  At the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed; 
2.  With the written consent of the affected landowner; 
3.  Upon findings by the board of aldermen by ordinance after notice and a public hearing, that natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the site specific development plan; 
4.  Upon payment to the affected landowner of compensation for all costs, expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner including but not limited to all fees paid in consideration of financing and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other consultants' fee incurred after approval by the city, together with interest thereon at the legal rate until paid. Compensation shall not include any diminution in the value of the property which is caused by such action; 
5.  Upon findings by the board of aldermen by ordinance after notice and a hearing, that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations that made a difference in the approval by the approval authority of the site specific development plan; or, 
6.  Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the site specific development plan, in which case the approval authority may modify by ordinance after notice and a hearing the affected provisions upon a finding that the change in state or federal law has a fundamental effect on the plan. 
G.  The applicable zoning district shall be established at the time of annexation. 
SECTION 1.9 - DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS 

1.9.1 - Authority and purpose. 
A.  This ordinance of the land use code is adopted pursuant to the authority contained in G.S. 160A-400.22 which states a local government may establish procedures and requirements to consider and enter into development agreements with developers for projects involving developable property of any size including property that is subject to an executed brownfields agreement pursuant to G.S. Part 5 of Article 9 of Chapter 130A. A development agreement must be approved by the town board of aldermen by ordinance. 
B.  Whenever any provision of this ordinance refers to or cites a section of the North Carolina General Statutes and that section of the general statutes is later amended or superseded, the ordinance shall be deemed amended to refer to the amended section or the section that most nearly corresponds to the superseded section. 
C.  This ordinance shall be effective throughout the town's planning jurisdiction which comprises the area within the corporate boundaries of the town as well as any area described in an adopted and/or amended ordinance by the town board of aldermen. Such planning jurisdiction may be modified from time to time in accordance with G.S. 160A-360 to 160A-365 and G.S. 160A-22 to 160A-58.28. 
D.  The intent of development agreements is to allow the town board flexibility in managing large projects which may have a variety of uses and purposes included in a master plan, or which would otherwise not be appropriate for a traditional neighborhood development or other zoning district designation available at the time of the development plan approval. 
E.  Development agreements are also intended to provide assurances of vested rights for a period of up to five years, unless a timeframe is otherwise provided in the development agreement itself, in cases where a project may be constructed over time or in phases.

If the above stated criteria are specified in the agreement, the town's land use intensities and dimensional standards are not applicable. 
D.  A situation that did not constitute a lawful, nonconforming situation under the zoning ordinance does not achieve lawful nonconforming status under this ordinance unless specified in the development agreement.

The code includes Volume I, General Construction; Volume I-B, One and Two Family Residential Building Code; Volume I-C, Accessibility Code; Volume I-D, Regulations for Manufactured Homes; Volume II, Plumbing Code; Volume III, Mechanical Code; Volume IV, Fuel Gas Code; Volume V, Energy Conservation Code; Volume VI, Administrative and Enforcement; Volume VII, National Electrical Code; and all subsequent editions and amendments. The code is hereby adopted by reference as fully as though set forth in this section, to include any and all future amendments thereto that may, from time to time, be adopted and approved by the state. 
B.  In addition the town adopts locally the following recommended practices of the International Residential Code the same as if set out at length herein: 
1.  Appendix F: Radon Control Methods 
2.  Appendix G: Swimming Pools, Spas, and Hot Tubs 
3.  Appendix M: Wood Decks 
4.  Appendix O: Construction Practice for Slab on Grade 
( Ord. No. O-14-07 , 8-11-2014) 
2.1.2. - Plumbing code addition. 
    Water line leak prevention and shut-off valves. In order to minimize leaks and conserve water, the Town of Black Mountain requires a test of 100 pounds of pressure on all water supply piping to structures in new construction, and if existing water lines are being replaced. A shut-off valve shall be required between the town meter and the structure it is serving that is externally accessible in order to isolate or shut-off all water to the structure without accessing the town meter per Chapter V, Section 52.26 of the Town Public Works Regulations [section 48-163]. The shut-off valve shall be located within three feet of the town's meter. This allows temporary shut-off of water to address leaks for seasonal rental properties or if the structure is to remain unoccupied for an extended period. 
( Ord. No. O-14-16 , 12-8-2014) 
2.1.3 - Copies of codes and green building guidelines to be maintained. 
    Copies of cited codes, the North Carolina Green Builder Program Guidelines and the LEED TM (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Green Building Rating System of the U.S. Green Building Council shall be maintained within the building inspections office for reference. 
2.1.4 - Application for a building permit. 
    Applications for building permits shall include a site plan or plot plan drawn to scale showing: 
1.  The actual dimensions and shape of the lot to be built upon. 
2.  Exact sizes, location, and dimensions of the proposed building or alteration. 
3.  Location of the lot with respect to adjacent rights-of-way. 
4.  Location and dimensions of off-street parking and ingress and egress to such space. 
5.  Any other information as may be lawfully required by the building inspector and zoning administrator, including location of existing and proposed uses of buildings and land; number of families, housekeeping units or rental units the building is designed to accommodate; conditions existing in conformance with and provided for the enforcement of this chapter. The site plan shall be retained by the planning department. 
2.1.5 - Town zoning authorization and building permit required. 
A.  Permit required before work is begun. Failure to obtain a written permit prior to beginning of construction shall constitute a violation of this article and subject the offender to a civil penalty as set out in section 150.99 [section 8.2.28]. Penalties may be waived in cases of emergency repairs or hardship as determined by the building inspector. Questions concerning whether or not specific work or jobs need a permit should be directed to the town building inspector's office. 
B.  Zoning, stormwater and fire safety authorization required. No building permit will be issued until the town zoning administrator has provided his or her authorization that the proposed structure is compliant with the zoning district in which it is located and all other applicable regulations, including stormwater, parking, and other site plan requirements, and until the town fire prevention inspector has provided his or her authorization that the project is compliant with the town fire district ordinance. 
C.  Permits issued for approved lots only. The building permit shall not be issued for construction on new lots which are created by the subdivision of land unless the subdivision has been approved. The subdivision preliminary plat approved by the planning board must be provided to the building inspector before any building permit is issued for infrastructure construction. 
D.  Failure to obtain a written permit. Failure to obtain a written permit shall constitute a violation of this article and subject the offender to a civil penalty as set out in section 150.99 [section 8.2.28]. 
E.  False statements. False statements on any application for a license or permit shall be grounds for immediate revocation or denial of such license or permit. 
2.1.6 - Certificates of occupancy and compliance. 
A.  At the conclusion of all work done under a permit, the town building inspector shall make a final inspection, and, if the completed work is within compliance, shall issue a certificate of occupancy and compliance. No newly constructed building may be occupied until the building inspector has issued this certificate. A temporary certificate of compliance may be issued permitting occupancy for a stated period of specific portions of a building. 
B.  When a commercial building or leased space changes ownership or business type, a certificate of occupancy and compliance is required to ensure fire and building safety and zoning compliance. Any residences which are converted to any type of non-residential use are required by North Carolina State Law to have a building inspection done. Any converted building shall be required to comply with required site plan or building renovation permit submittal and to obtain a commercial certificate of occupancy (see also section 4.4). 
C.  Any application for a certificate of occupancy shall be accompanied by payment of such fee as the town board of aldermen may establish, and such application will not be processed until such fee is paid. 
2.1.7 - Reserved.

The stop order shall be in writing and shall state the specific work to be stopped, the reasons, and the conditions under which the work may be resumed, and include notice of any civil penalties that may be issued. 
E.  Appeals of stop work orders may be made to the North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance or his/her designee within a period of five days after the order is issued. 
2.1.9 - Time limitations on permits. 
    A permit issued shall expire after six months of the date of issuance if the work authorized by the permit has not commenced. If after commencement, the work is discontinued for a period of 12 months, the permit shall immediately expire. No work authorized by permit that has expired shall thereafter be performed until a new permit is secured. 
2.1.10 - Public right-of-way to be maintained. 
    No building or construction material shall be placed or left on any street, alleyway, sidewalk or other public property except with permission from the town manager. Permits for use of town right-of-way may be granted by the town manager only when the request will not endanger public safety, and for renewable periods of no longer than 45 days.

To encourage new home and rental development to be available at median to low income market prices, the town will provide a 50 percent rebate from the calculated building permit fee for construction projects that are developed by a housing agency utilizing federal or state CDBG, HOME, HUD or other grant funds designated for the purpose of affordable housing. A 50 percent rebate will also be provided to any developer who provides documentation that the unit on which the fee was paid was sold at a price level consistent with affordable housing guidelines as established by Buncombe County. 
3.  For new construction that meets the criteria of both paragraphs one and two above, a 50 percent rebate will be provided from the building permit fee and all required mechanical, electrical and plumbing inspections will be conducted for a flat, comprehensive fee of $100.00 per unit. 
(Ord. No. O-11-01, § 3, 5-9-2011) 
2.1.12 - Unsafe residential buildings condemned. 
A.  The building inspector is appointed to exercise the powers of condemnation as provided under G.S. 160A-426-160A-443. 
B.  Any residential building or manufactured home which shall appear to the building inspector to be especially dangerous to life because of its liability to fire or because of bad condition of walls, overloaded floors, defective construction, decay, unsafe wiring or heating system, inadequate means of egress, or other causes, shall be held to be unsafe, and the inspector shall affix a notice of the dangerous character of the structure to a conspicuous place on the exterior wall of said building.

B.  Investigation. Whenever it appears to the building inspector that a nonresidential building or structure has not been properly maintained so that the safety or health of its occupants or members of the general public are jeopardized for failure of the property to meet the minimum standards established by subsection A, the building inspector shall undertake a preliminary investigation. If entry upon the premises for purposes of investigation is necessary, such entry shall be made pursuant to a duly issued administrative search warrant or with permission of the owner, the owner's agent, a tenant, or other person legally in possession of the premises. 
C.  Complaint and hearing. 
(a)  If the preliminary investigation discloses evidence that a building is in violation of the minimum standards, he shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner of such building a complaint stating the charges and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the building inspector at a place and time therein fixed, not less than ten nor more than 30 days after the serving of said complaint. The owner shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint.

Such building has been condemned under the building laws of the State of North Carolina and the Town of Black Mountain." 
(b)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the building, the building inspector may: 
(1)  Cause such structure to be removed or demolished; 
(2)  Cause to be posted, pending demolition, on the main entrance of any structure so closed, a placard entitled, "Notice of condemnation" with the following words: 
"Notice is hereby given that this building is unsafe and dangerous condition; may constitute a fire hazard by reason of structural defects and general state of decay, deterioration and disrepair; may be hazardous or dangerous to children or members of the public generally, or may be dangerously infested with vermin, rodents or insects. Such building has been condemned under the building laws of the State of North Carolina and the Town of Black Mountain." 
(c)  The duties of the building inspector set forth in subsections (a) and (b) shall not be exercised until: 
(1)  The town attorney shall institute in the general court of justice an appropriate action to seek an order of the court directing such owner to comply with the order of the building inspector; or 
(2)  The building inspector shall request the board to order him by an ordinance specifically describing the subject property to do either of the following: 
a.  To cause such building to be repaired, altered and improved to comply with the standards established by this article; or 
b.  To cause such building to be vacated, closed, and removed or demolished. The board, in ordering one of the aforesaid alternatives, shall order the specific action that will best effectuate the purposes of this article. Once the ordinance is adopted by the board a true copy of such ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the county and the registrar shall index the name of the property owner in the "grantor index." 
(d)  The amount of the cost of repairs, alterations and improvements, or vacating, closing and removal or demolition shall be a lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred.

If the unsafe building is removed or demolished by the building inspector, he shall, if possible, sell in any commercially reasonable manner the materials of the unsafe building and shall credit the proceeds of the sale, if any, against the cost of the removal or demolition. Any balance remaining shall be deposited by the building inspector with the clerk of superior court for subsequent disbursement by the court to the persons found by the court to be entitled thereto. 
(e)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the town to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise, nor shall enforcement of one remedy provided herein prevent the enforcement of any other remedies provided herein or otherwise. 
(f)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the building inspector in the proper enforcement of the duties of his office, as assigned, nor shall the enforcement of one remedy provided herein prevent the enforcement of any other remedies provided herein or otherwise.

All other appeals shall be taken by filing with the zoning board of adjustment (hereinafter called "ZBA") a notice of appeal within 30 days from date of receipt of the building inspector's decision in writing, and such notice of appeal shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the building inspector shall forthwith transmit to the ZBA all the papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from a decision of the building inspector refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a decision of the building inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the ZBA, unless the building inspector certifies to the board after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished to the appellant), a suspension of his requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, the requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause upon not less than five days' written notice by a court of record. All regulations, fees and other rules of the ZBA shall apply to these appeals. 
(b)  The ZBA shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The ZBA may reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of the building inspector, but the majority vote of the members of the ZBA shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the building inspector. The ZBA shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the ordinance, to adapt the application of the ordinance to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. 
(c)  If the building is in the historic preservation district, or has been determined by the historic preservation commission to be a historic structure, the zba may enter an order holding the matter in abeyance provided that the owner repairs the building on a timely basis. Such repairs shall commence within six months of the ZBA's order and shall be completed within two years of said date. All such repairs shall be completed in such a way as to maintain the historic character of the building and shall comply with the United States Secretary of Interior standards for the treatment of historic rehabilitation and the rules and guidelines of the Black Mountain Historic Preservation Commission. If the repairs are not commenced and completed within the time periods set out in the order, the building inspector shall proceed to enforce his original order. 
(d)  Every decision of the ZBA shall be subject to review by the county superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within 30 days of the receipt of the written decision of the ZBA. 
G.  Violations and penalties. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for the owner of any building to fail, neglect, or refuse to repair, alter, and improve the same; or to fail to vacate, close and remove or demolish the same, upon order of the building inspector duly made and served as herein provided, within the time specified in such order, and each day that any such failure, neglect, or refusal to comply with such order continues shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.

(b)  Any owner of a building who fails to comply with any order described in subsection (a), or who allows occupancy of the building subject to such order after the compliance period in the order has expired, shall be subject to a civil penalty of $500.00 for each day that noncompliance continues following the expiration of the compliance period specified in the order of compliance. If a person fails to pay the civil penalty within ten days of the citation, the town may seek to collect it in a civil action in the nature of a debt. 
(c)  Each day that a violation continues after notification that such violation exists shall constitute a separate and distinct offense for purposes of the penalties and remedies set forth in this section. 
(d)  This article may be enforced by any appropriate equitable action. 
(e)  This article may be enforced by any one, or any combination of the remedies authorized in this section.

SECTION 2.3 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE (ORD. NO. 0-09-02) 
Article 1. - Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Objectives 

Section A. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in G.S. ch. 143, art. 21, pt. 6; G.S. ch. 160A, art. 19, pts. 3, 5, 8; and G.S. ch. 160A, art. 8, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
    Therefore, the Board of Aldermen of the Town of Black Mountain, North Carolina, does ordain as follows: 
Section B. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of Black Mountain are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards. 
Section C. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within floodprone areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
Section D. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this ordinance are to: 
(1)  Protect human life, safety, and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in floodprone areas; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area.

The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, or a gas, liquid, or liquefied gas storage tank that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure during any one-year period whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. See definition of "substantial improvement." Also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(a)  Any correction of existing violations of state or community health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(b)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Articles 4 and 5 is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation (WSE) means the height, in relation to mean sea level, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

(14)  All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have received all necessary permits from those governmental agencies for which approval is required by federal or state law, including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334. 
(15)  When a structure is partially located in a special flood hazard area, the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction and substantial improvements. 
(16)  When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in a flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood elevation shall apply. 
Section B. - Specific standards. 
    In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided, as set forth in article 3, section B, or article 5, section D, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of article 5, section A, are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in article 2 of this ordinance. 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in article 2 of this ordinance. Structures located in A, AE, AO, and A1-30 zones may be floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the floodproofing standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in article 4, section B(3), along with the operational plan and inspection and maintenance plan. 
(3)  Manufactured homes.

Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is required. 
(c)  All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the requirements of article 5, section B(4). 
(d)  An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within floodprone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the floodplain administrator and the local emergency management coordinator. 
(4)  Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor: 
(a)  Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms, except to enclose storage areas; 
(b)  Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least to the regulatory flood protection elevation; and 
(c)  Shall include, in zones A, AE, and A1-30, flood openings to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum design criteria:

(v)  Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; and 
(vi)  Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above. 
(5)  Additions/improvements. 
(a)  Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are: 
(i)  Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more nonconforming than the existing structure. 
(ii)  A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new construction. 
(b)  Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.

(g)  Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection elevation in conformance with the provisions of article 5, section B(4)(c). 
An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet that satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an elevation or floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing certifications are required for all other accessory structures in accordance with article 4, section B(3). 
Section C. - Reserved. 
Section D. - Standards for floodplains without established base flood elevations. 
    Within the special flood hazard areas designated as approximate zone A and established in article 3, section B, where no base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of article 5, section A, shall apply: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20 feet each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream, whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be determined based on the following criteria: 
(a)  When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this ordinance and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in article 5, sections A and B. 
(b)  When floodway or non-encroachment area data is available from a federal, state, or other source, all new construction and substantial improvements within floodway and non-encroachment areas shall also comply with the requirements of article 5, sections B and F. 
(c)  All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if development is greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in accordance with article 3, section B and utilized in implementing this ordinance. 
(d)  When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a federal, state, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be elevated or floodproofed (nonresidential) to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in article 2. All other applicable provisions of article 5, section B shall also apply. 
Section E. - Standards for riverine floodplains with base flood elevations but without established floodways or non-encroachment areas. 
    Along rivers and streams where base flood elevation (BFE) data is provided by FEMA or is available from another source but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS report, the following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas: 
(1)  Standards of article 5, sections A and B; and 
(2)  Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
Section F. - Floodways and non-encroachment areas. 
    Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within the special flood hazard areas established in article 3, section B. The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in article 5, sections A and B, shall apply to all development within such areas: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless: 
(a)  It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice and presented to the floodplain administrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or 
(b)  A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion of the proposed encroachment. 
(2)  If article 5, section F(1) is satisfied, all development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this ordinance. 
(3)  No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the following provisions are met: 
(a)  The anchoring and the elevation standards of article 5, section B(3); and such engineering to be certified. 
(b)  The no encroachment standard of article 5, section F(1). 
(4)  No vegetative debris such as wood piles, downed trees or branches which could cause blockage of culverts or bridges or which could otherwise create a hazard during a flood event shall be permitted to accumulate within the floodway areas. 
(5)  No discarded or store items such as abandoned vehicles, white goods, tires, or miscellaneous debris shall be allowed to accumulate within the floodway areas.

1.  Place a portion of the required linear footage of sidewalk or greenway outside of the subdivision within the public right-of-way where there is opportunity to improve connectivity to the subdivision being developed (such as to link the subdivisions' sidewalk to an existing bus stop, park, sidewalk or greenway) in exchange for equal reduction in linear footage within the subdivision interior. 
2.  Pay the financial equivalent to the town in order to develop sidewalks on arterial or collector roads that serve that subdivision, or 
3.  Develop a greenway trail of equivalent cost through the property in order to implement the town's greenway master plan and instead of sidewalks or in combination with required sidewalks. 
C.  The location and specifications of sidewalks or trails shall be shown on preliminary plats and master plans under consideration by the building inspector for issuance of a building permit. 
D.  Whenever practicable, the construction of a sidewalk shall be on a line parallel with the edge of the public right-of-way of a street, highway or road, and the edge of a sidewalk will be a minimum of two feet from said roadway's edge of pavement or its curb/gutter.

D.  Requirements concerning land dedicated to the town for recreational purposes. The board of aldermen must approve property dedications being offered to the town for parks and greenways facilities at the time of final plat approval. The board of aldermen may request review by the recreation and parks commission before making their determination. Dedications should meet the following criteria: 
1.  Unity. Dedicated area shall form a single parcel of land, except where the board of aldermen determines that two or more parcels or a linear easement across multiple parcels would be in the best interest of the public given the type and distribution of space needed to serve the development. In such cases, the board may require that such parcels be connected by a dedicated strip of land or easement be at least 20 feet in width or that an easement for access be granted. 
2.  Usability. At least one-half of the total land dedicated shall be located outside of areas of special flood hazard, alluvial soils, lakes or other water bodies, and at least 75 percent of the total land dedicated shall be located outside of wetlands.

SECTION 4.3 - PROVISIONS GOVERNING ALL LOTS 

4.3.1 - Lot size and lot reductions. 
A.  All subdivision of property created after the effective date of this chapter must conform to the lot requirements of the district in which it is located. No yard or lot existing at the time of the passage of this chapter shall be altered except in compliance with the minimum requirements. 
B.  In areas not served by a public or community sewer system, the minimum lot area shall be that necessary for safe on-site waste disposal system as determined by the county health department, but in no case, shall the lot be smaller than the required area for the zoning district in which it is located. 
4.3.2 - Lot access. 
A.  No building, structure or use of land for other than conservation purposes shall be established on a lot which does not have access to a dedicated and accepted public street directly or by means of an easement. Access shall be a strip of land with a minimum width of 15 feet connecting any lot that does not abut a street with the nearest reasonable accessible street to said lot. The strip shall be under the same ownership as the lot to which it provides access, or shall be an easement of record and appurtenant to the lot for which it provides access. 
B.  Up to three lots may share access of one right-of-way so long as each lot has off-street parking for two cars available in addition to and from the right-of-way. In cases where four or more lots share access through a common right-of-way, the right-of-way shall be considered and designed as a named roadway and meet the requirements of a town street in accordance with the subdivision regulations. 
1.  In a conservation subdivision, rights-of-way that cannot meet the road standards for a subdivision without compromising performance goals of the conservation subdivision requirements (see 7.5.4) and which access more than three lots must meet the approval of the public works director and fire inspector for the purpose of waste collection, snow removal and maintenance, as well as emergency vehicle access. 
2.  In a special use or conditional use permit, the design of any shared parking and loading areas which are also serving to access more than three residential units must be approved by the fire inspector. 
C.  If the street or road serving the proposed development does not meet the town street standards, the developer shall make the necessary improvements to bring the street or road up to town standards or provide other improvements as determined by the board of aldermen as a result of a traffic impact analysis, or shall make a payment to the town to cover the cost of such improvements. The town board of aldermen may waive this requirement for street or road improvements if the town determines that the improvement will cause more community disruption than justified by the increased traffic from the proposed development. 
D.  Subdivisions for the purpose of land conservation or for the dedication of open space may be exempt from requirements of this section pursuant to subdivision regulations of the town. 
E.  Encroachment allowance for access within 30-foot buffer requirements (see also 8.2.10) Lots which include or are adjacent to perennial or intermittent surface waters as indicated on the most recent version of the 1:24,000 scale quadrangle topographic maps prepared by the USGS are subject to a 30-foot setback from the top of the bank of that surface water in accordance with phase II stormwater regulations. Pre-existing lots and those areas identified in adopted master plans are allowed a minimum encroachment into the 30-foot buffer for the purpose of transportation and access if the following criteria are met: 
1.  It is for the purpose of vehicle or non-motorized transportation and access only, such as trails, greenways, walkways, driveways, alleyways or access roads. Residential, accessory or commercial structures are not included in this encroachment allowance. 
2.  Utility structures that follow the right-of-way for the access are only allowed within the disturbance area of the roadway, an existing utility easement or bridge structural footprint. 
3.  It is the minimum encroachment necessary for access of the property, or is part of a trail, sidewalk or street alignment included on the town's pedestrian master plan, greenway plan or transportation plan or other approved master plan. 
4.  The encroachment area does not exceed more than ten percent of the total land area within the required buffer area, and shall never exceed more than 100 feet of linear disturbance for 1,000 feet of linear stream. 
5.  Provides the minimum area of disturbance needed for access and includes mitigation of stream and stream bank disturbance as part of the design. 
6.  Encroachments which include stream crossings should be designed so that crossing is perpendicular to the stream centerline to the maximum extent practicable. 
7.  Encroachments which are parallel to the watercourse should be designed to incorporate the maximum buffer practicable and still allow the necessary encroachment. Additional stormwater management techniques to slow and filtrate run-off shall be included between the disturbed area and the waterway. Such parallel encroachments may be subject to additional review by the state division of water quality. 
    Any encroachment into the required surface water buffer setback which exceeds this allowance shall require a variance from the zoning board of adjustment. 
4.3.3 - Setbacks, corner lots and double frontage lots. 
A.  The yard and setback requirements for the district in which the development is proposed shall be met unless variance is granted by the zoning board of adjustment. 
B.  Minimum setbacks shall be measured horizontally from the origin of the setback as the right-of-way, or property boundary, to the nearest portion of the building or structure. 
C.  If the property line extends into a roadway or highway, then the setback line shall be measured from the edge of the roadway or back of the curb when computing setback requirements. 
D.  Wherever right-of-way has not been established, setback shall be measured from the outer edge of the existing drainage ditch running parallel and adjacent to the road, or four feet off the edge of pavement where no ditch exists, or from the edge of the traveled area on an unpaved road. 
E.  Public rights-of-way or easements for streets and roads shall not be considered a part of a lot or open space, or as front, side, or rear yard for the purpose of meeting yard requirements. Driveways, parking areas, loading zones, sidewalks, or greenways may encroach or be included within a yard setback without affecting the setback requirements (see also 4.4.7). 
F.  In developed areas where more than three structures already exist, the setback may be determined by the average setback on already built upon lots located wholly or in part within the same block and zoning district and fronting the same street. In such cases, the setback on such a lot may be less than the required setback but not less than the average of the existing setbacks on the developed lots. However, in no case shall setbacks be less than 15 feet, except in the C-1 central business district where the minimum setback is 12 feet. 
G.  No building or structure shall be placed within a roadway or highway right-of-way, except as otherwise provided in this ordinance. 
H.  Any structure on a corner lot shall comply with the minimum setback (front yard) requirements of the street which it faces, and shall comply with 50 percent of the minimum front yard setback requirements, if applicable, on any other street which the corner lot abuts. In case of doubt as to which street a structure faces, or if a structure is built so as not to face any street, the zoning administrator shall determine which setback, side yard and rear yard requirements apply. 
I.  For lots having frontage on two or more streets, but not located on a corner, the minimum front yard shall be provided on each street in accordance with the applicable district(s). 
J.  Reserved. 
K.  Allowable encroachments into required setbacks. The following may encroach upon required setbacks as set forth below unless specifically prohibited elsewhere in this chapter. 
1.  Sills, cornices, and similar ornamental features projecting from the principal building may encroach up to 18 inches into any required setback. 
2.  Bay windows, balconies, and similar features projecting from the principal building may encroach up to three feet into any required setback. 
3.  Decks, steps, uncovered porches, patios, and terraces may encroach into a required side or rear setback, but no closer than six feet to the side or rear property line. 
4.  Fences and walls may be located within the required minimum front, side, or rear setback as long as it doesn't cross property line boundaries. 
5.  Handicapped accessibility and life safety features (such as ramps, fire escapes, etc.) that are required by the North Carolina State Building Code may encroach into any required setback, but no closer than three feet from a side or rear property line. If a handicapped accessibility or life safety feature cannot meet this requirement due to the location of an existing structure or other impeding site feature on a residential lot, then the setback requirement for these structures can be adjusted to the extent necessary by the planning director. 
(Ord. No. O-11-01, § 5, 5-9-2011; Ord. No. O-14-13 , 10-13-2014; Ord. No. O-15-05 , § 3, 4-13-2015; Ord. No. O-16-04 , § 1, 3-14-2016) 
4.3.4 - Steep hillside setback allowance for residential lots. 
    On lots where the first 45 feet from the edge of the pavement exceeds 30 percent slope, front yard setbacks may be adjusted as follows:

SECTION 4.4 - PROVISIONS GOVERNING ALL BUILDINGS 

4.4.1 - Location of building lines. 
    Locations of front, side and rear building lines as oriented on a lot shall be determined by the zoning administrator. Such determinations shall be based on the intent of the town and district regulations to achieve appropriate spacing and location of buildings within parcels. 
4.4.2 - Height regulations. 
A.  Structures shall not be erected or altered so as to exceed the height regulations of the district in which it is located. 
B.  Height shall be measured as the average vertical distance from the highest adjacent grade at the base of a structure at the corners of the structure, or from the grade of the centerline of the nearest adjacent public roadway, whichever is higher, to the highest point of the coping of a flat roof, to the deck line of a mansard roof, or to the mean height level between the eaves and ridge of a gable, hip or gambrel roof. 
C.  Where buildings are located on slopes, the average height will be calculated for each side of the building at its corners and at no side of the building should the maximum height from the adjacent grade be more than ten feet greater than the allowable building height for the district. 
D.  Chimneys shall not be included in the measurement of building height. 
E.  Steeples or towers associated with places of worship or government facilities, and water towers required for fire safety and water supply are exempt from these requirements. 
F.  Free-standing communications towers are permitted as a conditional use and are exempt from building height requirements of this section. 
G.  This section does not apply to amateur radio antennas affected and controlled by FCC regulations codified in Chapter 47, Section 97, of the Code of Federal Regulations. 
H.  Maximum building height for free-standing mechanical equipment appurtenant to the use, including chimneys, storage containers, tanks, water towers or chillers shall not exceed the maximum height of the district in which the use is located. 
I.  Mechanical equipment located on the roof shall not count towards the building height requirement and shall be screened to the greatest extent possible from the edge of the roadway of adjacent public roadways, with the exception of Interstate 40. Structural screening immediately adjacent and surrounding roof-top mechanical equipment is allowed in addition to or instead of a parapet for the purpose of visual screening and protection. Such structural screening for mechanical equipment shall not be at a height not to exceed the highest member of the mechanical equipment itself. 
J.  Parapets may be used in all districts and shall not count toward the building height requirements, as long as they do not add more than ten percent of footage to the overall building height above the maximum height for the district. Parapets may be used to meet the screening requirement for rooftop mechanical equipment. For example: 
Max. Building Height Max. Parapet (10%) Max. Ht. with 
Parapet District 55 5.5 60.5 LI-8 48 4.8 52.8 HI-0 40 4.0 44.0 CB, HB-8 35 3.5 38.5 CR-1, SR-2, TR-4, UR-8, OI-6, UR-8, ICD, TND  
4.4.3 - Principal buildings and structures per lot. 
A.  Every building erected, moved or structurally altered shall be located on a single lot and in no case shall there be more than one principal building and its customary accessory buildings on the lot unless: 
1.  As part of an approved industrial operation within either of the industrial districts (LI-8 or HI-0); or 
2.  As part of an approved conditional or special use permit; or 
3.  As part of a pre-existing nonconforming use. 
B.  Duplexes within a single lot will be treated as a single primary structure for the purposes of compliance with zoning district lot size and setback unless regulated by the minimum lot size and density table for steep slope lots. For separate units within a zero-lot line structure such as those for some types of town homes or attached houses, the individual units will be considered the primary structure for each lot. 
C.  Please see chapter 5 for guidelines on accessory buildings. 
4.4.4 - Storm and sanitary sewerage. 
    Storm and sanitary sewerage shall be provided as required in the phase II stormwater ordinance or other town or state regulations and the town water regulations (title V, chapter 52) [chapter 48, article III of the Code of Ordinances]. In addition, those projects that do not fall within the stormwater ordinance shall also make provisions to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on adjoining properties and shall comply with sedimentation and erosion control requirements (see chapter 8). 
4.4.5 - Conversion from residential to non-residential use. 
    All residences, which are converted to any type of non-residential use, are required by North Carolina State Law to have a building inspection done. Any converted building shall be required to comply with required site plan submittal and to obtain a commercial certificate of occupancy. 
4.4.6 - Use and location of dumpsters. 
    Dumpsters are allowed in all districts in accordance to the following standards: 
A.  All dumpsters must be maintained in good working condition and their exterior shall be kept clean, free of debris, accumulations or effluent.

C.  Dumpsters which contain oil and grease shall not leak. 
D.  Dumpsters must be screened from the public right-of-way and from abutting residential property boundaries. Screening shall be with an opaque wall or fence that is at least one foot higher than the dumpster itself. Vegetative buffers of evergreen of sufficient height and density to meet the opaque screening requirement and which are a minimum of ten feet in width, may be permitted in lieu of a structural screen upon approval of the zoning administrator. 
E.  Dumpsters in common use as part of a special or conditional use permit must meet and maintain screening and location requirements as approved in a CUP or SUP plan. 
F.  Screening provided to meet town requirements must be maintained in good condition and on a continuous basis. 
G.  Requests for variances within the historic district must be reviewed by the historic preservation commission prior to the ZBA hearing. 
4.4.7 - General screening and buffering requirements. 
A.  Where a commercial or industrial use abuts a residential or mixed-use district, or where a pre-existing nonconforming use is within a residential district, there shall be an opaque wall or fence of at least four feet in height along the property line. A vegetative buffer of at least ten feet in width and six feet in height and of sufficient density may be permitted in lieu of a structural screen upon approval of the zoning administrator.

4.6.11 - TND traditional neighborhood development (master planned). 
4.6.11.1 Intent. 
The purpose of this district is to allow for the development of fully integrated, mixed-use pedestrian oriented neighborhoods. The intent is to minimize traffic congestion, suburban sprawl, infrastructure costs, and environmental degradation. The provisions of this district are based on urban design and development conventions which were widely used in the United States from colonial times until the 1940's and were based on the following principles: 
A. All neighborhoods have identifiable centers and edges. 
B. The center of the neighborhood is easily accessed by non-vehicular means from lots on the edges (i.e. approximately one-quarter-mile from center to edge, or a five-minute walk). 
C. Uses and housing types are mixed and in close proximity to one another. 
D. Street networks are interconnected and blocks are small. 
E. Civic buildings are given prominent sites throughout the neighborhood. 
4.6.11.2 Master plan required. 
A. A master plan in compliance with TND design standards and the general provisions of the subdivision regulations shall be provided with any application to reclassify a property to TND zoning. A rezoning request for TND zoning is contingent upon the approval of a master plan; if a master plan is not approved for the property, then it reverts to its previous zoning classification(s). No use or development of any property located in a TND district shall be permitted until a master plan, showing the proposed uses and development of the property, has been approved by the board of alderman, upon a recommendation made by the planning board. Once the master plan has been approved, the developer must follow the processes and regulations set forth in the Town of Black Mountain's Subdivision Regulations to proceed with development of the property. 
B. All submissions for approval shall include an agreement and approval by the associated TND master association governing the overall development. Specifically each new phase will have appropriate design standards and restrictions agreed upon and submitted to the appropriate county authority in the form of a supplemental master declaration. These additional design standards and restrictions shall be approved and filed prior to the commencement of any construction associated with that phase. The final plat submission and approval shall follow the same guidelines as the above preliminary plan. 
C. The master plan shall be certified by a registered architect, registered landscape architect or certified planner. 
D. If a developer proposes to construct the subdivision in phases, then the master plan shall be prepared for the entire property, and shall show the proposed phases of development. Each phase of development shall be preceded by the submission and approval of a preliminary plat for that phase, followed by the submission and approval of a final plat. In addition the master plan shall include: 
1. An outline of any additional regulatory intentions or design guidelines, 
2. Show intended phasing of development, and 
3. Include any other information, e.g., conceptual building prototypes, which may be required to evaluate the interior pedestrian environment and conditions at project edges. 
E. Approval process: 
1. The owner or developer shall submit ten copies of the master plan to the zoning administrator for consideration by the planning board at least ten working days prior to the next scheduled meeting of the planning board. 
2. The zoning administrator shall submit to the planning board at its next meeting any master plan that is in compliance with the design standards specified herein. 
3. A filing fee shall be paid. Any master plan re-submitted within one year for substantially the same property shall not pay an additional filing fee. (0-99-09, adopted 6-14-99) 
4. The planning board shall review a master plan submission or re-submission for no more than 180 days from the first meeting it is presented, in order to make a recommendation to the board of aldermen. Failure to make a recommendation accordingly shall cause the master plan to be forwarded to the board of aldermen without a recommendation. The applicant may withdraw a master plan by a written request to the zoning administrator. A withdrawn master plan may be re-submitted to the planning board for further reconsideration at a later time. 
5. Before approving a master plan and subsequent rezoning, the aldermen shall first hold a public hearing. Staff shall place notification of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the Town of Black Mountain once a week for two successive calendar weeks. The notice shall be published the first time not less than ten days nor more than 25 days before the date fixed for the hearing. In computing such period, the day of publication is not to be included but the day of the hearing shall be included. Meeting notice shall include the time and place of hearing. 
(a) Staff shall prominently post a notice of the public hearing on the site of the proposed master plan and rezoning or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way. Staff shall provide notice by first class mail to all property owners within 200 feet of the property boundary of the proposed master plan and rezoning and the date of the public hearing. Notice shall also be posted to the town website indicating the date and time of the hearing. 
6. Master plans not approved by the board of aldermen and subsequently revised shall be re-submitted through the approval process. 
7. Approved master plans shall not be revised without re-submission through the approval process. However, minor amendments at the site plan level for specific land uses or developments may be approved by the zoning administrator, provided: 
 Building floor areas are not changed by more than 20 percent; 
 Building or structure heights are not increased by more than 20 percent; 
 Parking areas or spaces are not diminished by more than 20 percent; 
 Relocated buildings or uses maintain the same general building relationships, landscaping and utility standards; and 
 The amendment preserves compliance with any specific requirements of the TND district and the town's general guidelines; 
 Appropriate HOA (master association) has reviewed and approved all revisions and submittals for a new phase commencement. This approval shall be in the form of a supplemental master declaration which is agreed to and approved by the master association. 
8. Once a master plan has been approved, the project may proceed through the major subdivision and permitting processes outlined in the subdivision regulations of chapter 3, with the master plan being considered as a preliminary plat. 
4.6.11.3 Development parameters. 
A. No minimum development size; however 40 acres is the recommended minimum size. 
B. No maximum development size; however 200 acres is the recommended maximum size. 
C. Maximum permitted densities and total number of dwelling units shall be established during the master plan review process. 
D. Buffer requirements shall be established during the master plan review process. Property located on the perimeter of the TND district shall have setbacks and buffers that are consistent with the setbacks and buffers of the adjoining zoning district, including provisions for accessory buildings, but shall be a minimum of 15 feet. 
4.6.11.4 Uses. 
A. Permitted uses shall be based on the general category of use that has been established for a lot or group of lots in the master plan. The general land use categories are listed below with particular uses allowed and suggested amounts for each, expressed as a percentage of the total gross area of the neighborhood: 
Use Amount Allowable Uses Public At least 5% Parks, squares, greenbelts, sidewalks/walkways, streets, alleys and civic uses Civic At least 2% Community buildings including meeting halls, libraries, post offices, schools, child care centers, clubhouses, religious buildings, recreational facilities, museums, performing arts buildings, and municipal buildings Shop front 2% to 20% Residential and commercial uses; approximately 50% of the building area shall be designated for residential use.* Attached Homes (Multi-Family) 15% to 30% Buildings for residential use and limited commercial use, such as a coffee house, home occupation or bed and breakfast inn Detached Homes 30% Buildings for residential uses, customary home occupational uses and bed and breakfast inns Business 5% to 15% Office, bar/brewery, restaurant, brew pub/tavern, retail, including eating establishments, and other commercial uses provided they produce little or no noise, odor, dust or vibration**

*Large-scale, single-use facilities (e.g., conference centers, theaters, athletic facilities) shall generally occur above or behind smaller scale street front space. 
4.6.11.5 Design standards. 
A. Neighborhood form. 
1. Dwellings at the edge of the neighborhood shall be roughly a five-minute walk to the center of the neighborhood. 
2. A great variety of housing types and price ranges shall exist in the neighborhood, with the highest density of housing located towards the center of the neighborhood. 
3. Within a neighborhood the following land uses shall be arranged to serve the needs of the residents in a convenient walking environment: open space/recreational areas, civic buildings, low and high density residential, retail/commercial, business/workplace, and parking. 
4. The area of the TND shall be divided into blocks, streets, lots and open space. 
5. Similar land uses shall generally enfront across each street. Dissimilar land uses shall generally abut at rear lot lines. Corner lots which front on streets of dissimilar use shall generally observe the setback established on each fronting street. 
6. Along existing streets, new buildings shall be compatible with the general spacing of structures, building mass and scale, and street frontage relationships of existing buildings. 
7. The appearance of the neighborhood should blend in with existing neighborhoods and feature the use of natural materials in construction. 
B. Lots and buildings: 
1. All lots shall share a frontage line with a street or public space; lots fronting on a public space shall have access to a rear alley. 
2. Consistent build-to lines shall be established along all streets and public space frontages. 
3. All buildings, except accessory structures, shall have their main entrance opening on a street or public space. 
4. No structure shall exceed 35 feet in height. 
C. Inclusion of affordable housing: 
1. Ten percent of all units created, whether for rental or purchase, must meet the affordable housing thresholds established by Buncombe County Community Development. Affordable units must blend into the overall development and not be aesthetically distinguishable from the other units, but may be of a higher density or smaller scale than other units within the development. For example, by making one of the buildings into a duplex, or by building a smaller sized unit of similar style, a developer can decrease their per unit cost and maintain the architectural integrity of their design. 
2. Instead of constructing affordable units, developers may opt to convey an undeveloped lot or lots within the development for construction by a town approved affordable housing agency to meet the ten-percent requirement as long as the lot(s) conveyed can accommodate an equal or greater number of units to ten percent of the overall development. 
3. A developer may also pay a fee-in-lieu of development or conveyance of a lot of equal value to ten percent of the overall estimated construction cost of the built-out master plan to the Town of Black Mountain for the purpose of creating new and affordable housing opportunities. 
D. Streets, alleys and pathways: 
1. Designs shall permit comfortable use of the street by motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists. Pavement widths, design speeds, and number of motor travel lanes should be minimized to enhance safety for motorists and non-motorists alike. The specific design of any given street must consider the building types which front on the street and the relationship of the street to the overall town street network. All roads shall be in compliance with the current North Carolina Fire Code including Appendix D. 
2. Public streets shall provide access to all tracts and lots and shall be in compliance with the current North Carolina Fire Code including Appendix D. 
3. Streets and alleys shall, wherever practical, terminate at other streets within the neighborhood and connect to existing and projected streets outside the development. Culs-de-sac and dead-end streets are discouraged and should only occur where absolutely necessary due to natural conditions and shall be in compliance with the current North Carolina Fire Code including Appendix D. 
4. No block face should have a length greater than 500 feet without dedicated alley or pathway providing through access. 
5. To prevent the build-up of vehicular speed, disperse traffic flow, and create a sense of visual enclosure, long uninterrupted segments of straight streets should be avoided. 
6. A continuous network of rear alleys is recommended for all lots in a TND. 
7. Utilities shall be underground and shall run along alleys wherever possible. 
8. Streets shall be organized according to a hierarchy based on function, size, capacity and design speed. Streets and rights-of-ways are therefore expected to differ in dimension. The proposed hierarchy of streets shall be indicated on the submitted master plan and each street type shall be separately detailed in the master plan. 
9. Every street, except alleys, shall have a sidewalk on at least one side that is at least five feet wide. In shop front areas, sidewalks shall be at least ten feet wide. 
E. Parking: 
1. On-street parking should be provided on all streets. Occasional on-street parking can be accommodated without additional pavement width. For streets which serve workplace and storefront buildings, on-street parking is required and should be marked as such. On-street parking should be parallel to street unless the street lends itself to other parking layouts. 
2. Parking lots shall generally be located at the rear or at the side of buildings and shall be screened from public rights-of-way and adjoining properties by land forms or evergreen vegetation so as to provide a barrier that will be at least three feet high and provide a 75 percent visual barrier within two years.

However, such streets may, at the discretion of the planning staff in consultation with public works staff, be allowed to remain unpaved with use of an approved surface treatment (gravel or other). 
L. Requirements concerning sidewalks and greenways. 
1. Sidewalks or greenway easements shall be provided in locations shown on the adopted comprehensive pedestrian master plan. A fee-in-lieu of construction or dedication of easement may be provided to the town at an equivalent cost to construction upon approval of the town planning board. 
2. Existing sidewalks at the time of development or re-development must be improved, repaired, or replaced as necessary in order to be compliant with town and ADA regulations as part of new projects. 
4.6.12.4 Plan review procedure and required steps. 
A. Meeting with building, planning, and zoning staff. Developer shall be required to meet with building, planning, and zoning staff for technical review prior to submitting a concept plan of the proposed development. The purpose of this meeting will be to acquaint the developer with the entire planning and developmental process for an ICD development. 
B. Submittal of concept plan. A concept plan outlining the general elements of the overall development, including, but not limited to, building footprints, street layout (with roadway widths), natural areas, floodway areas, floodplain areas, and proposed recreation areas. 
C. Submittal of master plan. The master plan shall be submitted no less than 30 days after the submittal of the concept plan. This time frame shall also be at least 30 days before the next regularly scheduled planning board meeting. The application for rezoning and rezoning fee should be submitted at this time. Such a plan shall be developed by a professional architect or civil engineer licensed to practice in the State of North Carolina. The applicant shall submit 12 complete copies of the master plan. To ensure clarity of the master plan presentation, utilities, landscaping, topography, and other specific categories of information may be required to be presented on separate layers, if, and as determined necessary, by the town staff. The master plan may be submitted and approved in separate phases in order to facilitate the long term development of the overall campus. 
D. Planning board considers rezoning request and the master plan. The planning board shall consider rezoning request and the master plan for the institutional campus development district at the next regularly scheduled planning board or a special called meeting. A recommendation is made by the planning board to the board of aldermen. 
E. Rezoning request and master plan review by board of aldermen. Recommendation for rezoning is submitted to board of aldermen and, if approved, the board of aldermen can then review the master plan. 
F. Before approving a master plan and subsequent rezoning, the aldermen shall first hold a public hearing. Staff shall place notification of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the Town of Black Mountain once a week for two successive calendar weeks. The notice shall be published the first time not less than ten days nor more than 25 days before the date fixed for the hearing. In computing such period, the day of publication is not to be included but the day of the hearing shall be included. Meeting notice shall include the time and place of hearing. 
(a) Staff shall prominently post a notice of the public hearing on the site of the proposed master plan and rezoning or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way. Staff shall provide notice by first class mail to all property owners within 200 feet of the property boundary of the proposed master plan and rezoning and the date of the public hearing. Notice shall also be posted to the town website indicating the date and time of the hearing. 
G. Changes to the master plan. If the project represents a substantial change from the approved master plan, a new master plan must be submitted for planning board and the board of aldermen approval. A "substantial change" means a change that, in the opinion of the building, planning, and zoning staff, substantially affects existing traffic circulation, drainage, relationship of buildings to each other, landscaping, buffering, or outdoor lighting; or significantly impacts existing infrastructure or town services (i.e., street capacity, water and sewer capacity, police or fire protection, or other service related town functions) or any change that may result in impact on neighboring properties and residents. Such changes shall include, but are not limited to: 
1. Addition or relocation of a building; 
2. Addition or relocation of a parking lot for over ten vehicles; 
3. Addition or relocation of parking or outdoor storage for service vehicles or equipment; 
4. Addition or relocation of any other major development (i.e., ball fields, tennis courts, golf courses, amphitheaters, or any other facility to be used by numerous people at one time); 
5. Relocation of a public street or private street connecting with the public street system. 
Any changes to areas such as small picnic areas, playgrounds, walking trails, gardens, patios, terraces, courtyards, walkways, and parking areas for ten or fewer vehicles, which do not constitute a "substantial change" may be approved by the planning director or his/her designee. 
H. The board of aldermen may deny the master plan, approve the master plan, or approve the master plan with conditions. The conditions upon the installation and operation of the proposed use(s) shall address the accumulated potential impact of the proposed use, including lighting, glare, noise, etc. in order that the use shall: 
1. Not interfere with the use of the other properties or alter the existing character of the immediate vicinity; 
2. Provide potential pedestrian or vehicular traffic that could be generated by the use(s) with adequate and safe connections to adjoining streets and pedestrian paths; and 
3. Provide adequate parking and access controls to the benefit of the property itself and the adjoining properties. 
4.6.12.5 Supplementary district regulations.

All permitted uses and conditional and special uses in this district are subject to approval of installation and materials by the public works director as designated, of curbs, gutters, storm drainage structures, sidewalks, entrances and exits, street paving, water and sewer facilities, and garbage collection procedures. 
B. Awning and canopy signs, marquee and time and temperature signs are not permitted. 
C. Banners, flags and pennants may only be used temporarily for special events and with the approval of the town zoning administrator. A plan showing diagrams of each type of banner, flag, or pennant and their method of installation must be submitted to the planning department for approval at least 30 days prior to the special event making use of these banners, flags, or pennants. The total amount of display time during which such banner, flag, or pennant shall be allowed to be used shall be a total of 30 days. The installation cannot be initiated until appropriate approval is received and not more than one week prior to the event. Banners, flags, or pennants must not obstruct any fire escape, window, or door, or be placed in such a manner so as to interfere with any openings required for ventilation, nor offer hindrance to fire department equipment or personnel. Banners, flags, or pennants may be placed in or along the right-of-way of public streets immediately adjacent to the campus, providing a letter of permission from the proper utility company and/or property owner, holding the town harmless, is submitted if the banner, flag, or pennant is to be attached to any utility pole or to any tree or other object located on private property. Nothing in these requirements shall be construed to imply any restriction or prohibition on the appropriate display of any official flag of the United States, the State of North Carolina or any other government entity. 
1. Manner of installation must be based on the established safety standards. 
2. The banners, etc., must be made of fire-retardant material or treated to be fire retardant. 
3. Maximum. The size of any banner, flag, etc. shall be 32 square feet.

4.7.3 - Historic district and historic conservation district overlay. 
4.7.3.1 Intent. 
The historical heritage of our town is one of our most valued and important assets. The conservation of and preservation of historic districts and landmarks stabilize and increase property values in their areas and strengthen the overall economy of the town. The purpose of establishing local conservation districts, historic districts and landmarks is to encourage the restoration, preservation, rehabilitation and conservation of historically, architecturally, and archaeologically significant areas, structures, buildings, sites, objects and their surroundings, and to review new construction design to ensure compatibility with the character of the district and to safeguard against any potentially adverse influences which may cause the decline, decay, or total destruction of these important assets. In addition, the preservation of historic districts and landmarks provides for the education, pleasure and enrichment of the residents of Black Mountain and the state as a whole. 
4.7.3.2 Historic district, conservation district and landmark establishment. 
A. Historic districts, conservation districts and landmarks are established through the application of an overlay district which are zoning districts that are applied only in conjunction with other zoning districts, and may grant additional use or development requirements upon the underlying zoning controlling the sue and development of a lot to ensure the compatibility and appropriateness of exterior design within the historic district or for the landmark. 
B. Overlay districts can be applied to any zoning districts and the boundaries of such overlay shall be shown on the official zoning map of the Town of Black Mountain. (i.e., "HD" overlay also referred to as "historic district") an overlay district can be initiated as an amendment by board of aldermen, planning board, historic preservation commission, or a property owner. 
4.7.3.3 Designation of historic districts. 
The board of aldermen may adopt, amend, reject, or repeal ordinances designating historic districts when adoption or amendment is pursuant to the following procedure:

B. The North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, acting through the state historic preservation officer or his or her designee, shall make an analysis of and recommendations concerning such report and description of proposed boundaries. Failure of the department to submit its written analysis and recommendations to the board of aldermen within 30 calendar days after a written request for such analysis has been received by the department of cultural resources shall relieve the town of any responsibility for awaiting such analysis, and the board of aldermen may at any time thereafter take any necessary action to adopt or amend its zoning ordinance. 
C. Historic districts shall consist of areas, which are deemed to be of special significance in terms of their history, prehistory, architecture and/or culture, and to posses integrity of design, setting, materials, feeling, and association. The area, buildings, structures, sites, or objects shall be significant elements of cultural, social, economic, political, or architectural history of the town or of the archaeological history or prehistory of the town. The conservation of such a district will provide for the education, pleasure and enhancement of the quality of life of all residents of the town.

D. The commission shall adopt principles and guidelines interpreting these criteria for new construction, alterations, additions, moving and demolition of landmarks or properties in the historic district. 
4.7.3.12 Demolition. 
A. An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the relocation, demolition, removal or destruction of a designated landmark or a building, structure or site within historic district may not be denied except as provided in section 4.7.3.12(C) below. However, the effective date of such a certificate may be delayed for a period of up to 365 days from the date of approval. The commission shall reduce the period of delay if it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use or return from such property by virtue of the delay. During such period the commission shall negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building or site.

B. If the commission has voted to recommend designation of a property as a landmark or designation of an area as a district, and final designation has not been made by the board of aldermen, the demolition or destruction of any building, site or structure located on the property of the proposed landmark or in the proposed district may be delayed by the commission for a period of up to 180 days or until the board of aldermen takes final action on the designation, whichever comes first. 
C. The board of aldermen may enact an ordinance to prevent the demolition by neglect of any designated landmark or any structure or building within the established historic district. Such ordinance shall provide appropriate safeguards to protect property owners from undue hardship. 
D. An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition or destruction of a building, site or structure determined by the state historic preservation officer as having statewide significance as defined in the criteria of the National Register of Historic Places may be denied except where the commission finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use or return by virtue of the denial. 
4.7.3.13 Land use, interior arrangement, maintenance, emergency repairs not considered. 
A. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a property owner from making any use of his or her property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations. 
B. The commission may enter, solely in performance of its official duties and only at reasonable times, upon private lands for examination or survey thereof. However, no member, employee, or agent of the commission may enter any private building or structure without express consent of the owner or occupant thereof. 
C. Except as provided in paragraph D. below, the commission shall have no jurisdiction over interior arrangement and shall take no action except to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving or demolition of buildings, structures, appurtenant features, outdoor advertising signs, or other significant features which would be incongruous with the special character of a landmark or of the district. 
D. Notwithstanding paragraph C. above, the jurisdiction of the commission over interior spaces shall be limited to specific interior features of architectural, artistic or historical significance in publicly owned designated landmarks; and of privately owned historic landmarks for which consent for interior review has been given by the owner. Said consent of any owner for interior review shall bind future owners and/or successors in title, provided such consent has been filed in the office of the register of deeds and indexed accordingly to the name of the owner of the property in the grantee and grantor indexes. The landmark designation shall specify the interior features to be reviewed and the specific nature of the commission's jurisdiction over the interior. 
E. The ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature of a landmark, or in the historic district (HD) which does not involve a change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof, shall not be prevented by the requirements pertaining to the designated landmark or historic district. 
F. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent (a) the maintenance or (b) in the event of an emergency, the immediate restoration of any existing above-ground utility structure without approval by the commission or the ordinary repair of streets, sidewalks, pavement markings, street signs, or traffic signs. 
G. The construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving or demolition of any exterior architectural features, which the town building inspector or similar official shall certify is required for public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition, shall not be prevented by the requirements pertaining to the landmark, or the historic district. 
4.7.3.14 Hearing procedures. 
A.  The historic preservation commission shall receive applications for certificates of appropriateness.

B. Minor works-A certificate of appropriateness application, when determined to involve a minor work, may be reviewed and approved by the minor works committee or in some cases by staff as outlined in the design guidelines. The minor works committee consists of the historic preservation commission chairman and vice-chairman and the planning director or his or her designee. 
1. Minor works are defined as those exterior changes that do not involve substantial alterations, additions or removals that could impair the integrity of the landmark or property in the historic district. 
2. An application may receive a certificate of appropriateness from staff or the committee if it falls under the list of minor works provided in the historic preservation commission rules of procedure or the design guidelines.

No application may be denied without formal action by the historic preservation commission. All minor works applications approved by the planning director or his/her designee shall be forwarded to the commission for their information in time for its next scheduled meeting. 
4.7.3.16 Certificate issuance; expiration; enforcement. 
A. Passage of a motion to approve, with or without modification, an application shall constitute the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness by the historic preservation commission. The application and the duly approved minutes of the commission shall constitute the written documentation of such issuance. Following the meeting a certificate shall be mailed to the property for which a certificate has been issued. The certificate shall be posted on the premises, in a location visible from the street, while the work is in progress. Minutes of a historic preservation commission meeting shall be approved before the end of the next meeting. 
B. A certificate of appropriateness shall be valid for a period of six months from the date of issuance for the purpose of obtaining a zoning permit or other permit for constructing or altering structures. A certificate of appropriateness shall expire six months after the date of issuance if the work authorized by the certificate has not been commenced. If after commencement the work is discontinued for a period of six months, the permit shall immediately expire. 
C. Compliance with certificates of appropriateness shall be enforced by the planning director or his or her designee.

D. In case any building, structure, site, area or object designated as a landmark or located within the historic district is about to be demolished whether as a result of deliberate neglect or otherwise, materially altered, remodeled, removed or destroyed, except in compliance with the ordinance, the commission or other party aggrieved by such action may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful demolition, destruction, material alteration, remodeling or removal, to restrain, correct or abate such violation, or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such a building or structure. 
4.7.3.17 Conditions for certain approvals. 
A. In the event that the commission, in considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, shall find that a building or structure for which a zoning permit is requested is to be an authentic restoration or reconstruction of a building or structure which existed at the same location but does not meet zoning requirements, said building or structure may be authorized to be restored or reconstructed at the same location where the original building or structure was located, provided the zoning board of adjustment authorizes such as a special exception and no use other than that permitted in the district in which such is located is made of said property. Such conditions as may be attached to the historic preservation commission approval and those conditions as may be set by the zoning board of adjustment shall be included in any certificate of appropriateness related thereto. 
B. If the commission finds that an application for a certificate of appropriateness concerning any porches, steps, posts, fences, walls or other items extending over, on or within public rights-of-way to be necessary for the authentic restoration, reconstruction or maintenance thereof, and will not impede or block pedestrian traffic or constitute a hazard to public safety, such findings shall be transmitted to board of aldermen for its consideration in authorizing or denying such encroachments into rights-of-way. 
C. If the board of aldermen authorizes such encroachment, any items restored, reconstructed or maintained on, over or within a public right-of-way shall be the responsibility of the owner, and the owner shall agree to protect and hold the Town of Black Mountain blameless against any and all liability, cost damage or expense suffered as a result of the restoration, reconstruction or maintenance thereof. The lowest point of any such item projecting over any sidewalk shall be at least nine feet above the sidewalk immediately below. 
4.7.3.18 Conservation district review required. 
A. From and after the designation of a downtown conservation district, no project involving a major work (as defined in the "Black Mountain Historic District Design Guidelines") shall be erected, altered, restored, moved or demolished within the downtown conservation district, until after an application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to and reviewed by the historic preservation commission. Such a certificate is required to be issued by the commission prior to the issuance of a building permit or other permit granted for the purpose of constructing, altering, moving or demolishing structures. 
B. The conservation district review procedure is established as an education program and as a means to further the goals of the town's historic preservation efforts. The purpose of the review procedure is to advise and educate rather than to regulate. The review process in this section is mandatory, however compliance with the recommendations contained in the review is voluntary. 
C. Applications for a conservation district review shall be obtained from, and when completed, filed with the planning director or his or her designee. The application shall be filed two weeks prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the commission. Sketches, drawings, photographs, specifications, descriptions and other information of sufficient detail to clearly show the proposed exterior alterations, additions, changes or new construction shall accompany each application. 
D. Projects shall be reviewed and certificates of appropriateness shall be issued consistent with the principles and guidelines adopted by the commission for review of changes. It is the intent of these regulations to insure, insofar as possible, that construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving or demolition of buildings, structures, or appurtenant fixtures shall be congruous with the special character of the district. 
E. Applications for a conservation district review shall be reviewed and a certificate of appropriateness issued within 30 days from the date that the application is received by the town.

4.7.4 - Reserved. 
4.7.5 - Fire district overlay. 
4.7.5.1 Statutory authorization and enactment. 
Pursuant to the authority conferred by G.S. 160A-435, the board of aldermen do hereby ordain and enact in to law this chapter establishing primary fire district. 
4.7.5.2 Intent. 
This overlay establishes standards for the construction, alteration, and repair of buildings and structures located within, erected within, or moved within or into the primary fire district from another location. The construction and maintenance requirements set forth herein are consistent with North Carolina General Statutes; the latest North Carolina Edition of the International Building Code, as currently enforced within the State of North Carolina and the Town of Black Mountain; and, professionally recognized practices designed to produce a reasonable level of life safety and property protection from fire hazards in premises that are located, or capable of being located, within close proximity to one another. 
4.7.5.3 Definitions. 
For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. 
Additional required protection features. Fire suppression equipment that is installed in a structure that is designed to lessen the exposure to potential fire damage. Such equipment shall include, but shall not be limited to, automatic fire protection systems and automatic alarm systems, or other properly engineered and approved features that provide increased levels of protection equal to or exceeding automatic fire protection. 
Heavy timber construction. A type of construction in which the exterior walls are made of noncombustible materials and the interior structural building elements are of solid or laminated wood. To be considered to be heavy timber construction, supporting wood columns and roof framing shall not be less than six inches in width and eight inches in depth while floor framing members shall not be less than six inches in width and ten inches in depth. 
Increased fire hazard. An increase in the volume of combustible material contained in the erected, repaired, altered, or moved structure that is not otherwise offset by the installation of additional required protection features; or, changes in the building features that allow increased communication of fire from one building to another (such as increasing the number of openings in exterior walls). 
Reasonable routine maintenance. Replacement of existing portions of the structure with like materials so as to avoid deterioration, or further deterioration, of the structure. 
Repair or alteration. Repairs or alterations to a building that exceed reasonable routine maintenance; that exceed 50 percent of the current value of the building; or, that change the exterior finish, exterior configuration, number of openings in exterior walls, or the footprint of the building. This does not include emergency repairs needed to secure the building from water, storms, or unauthorized access. For the purposes of this definition the current value of the structure shall be interpreted to be the assessed tax value of the structure as listed by the Buncombe County Tax Office or, as determined by a certified appraisal, before the improvement is started. If the structure has been damaged and is being repaired, the value of the structure shall be interpreted to mean the value before the damage or destruction occurred. 
Wood or frame structure. A type of construction whose primary structural elements are formed by a system of repetitive wood framing members. For the purposes of this ordinance wood or frame structures shall not include heavy timber, metal frame, or masonry construction where the exterior walls are composed of noncombustible materials that support the roof load. Noncombustible veneer facades attached to exterior walls are not considered to be noncombustible exterior walls. 
4.7.5.4 Application required. 
Application for any activity regulated by the provisions of this section shall be made to the office of the building inspector for the Town of Black Mountain prior to the commencement of any work associated with the proposed project. 
4.7.5.5 Primary fire district regulations. 
In accordance with the requirements of G.S. 160A-435, the Town of Black Mountain hereby establishes a primary fire district.

In addition, a map of the affected property, based upon the aforementioned legal description, is available for inspection in the office of the town clerk in the Black Mountain Town Hall and in the Black Mountain Planning and Zoning Department. 
B. Enforcement of building and fire codes. All buildings and structures erected, repaired, altered, or moved within or into the primary fire district shall comply with the provisions of the North Carolina edition of the 2000 International Building and Fire Code, as currently enforced within the State of North Carolina and duly adopted and enforced within the Town of Black Mountain. 
C. Wood or frame structures allowed. In accordance with G.S. 160-436, no wood or frame building or structure may be erected, repaired or altered, or moved into or within the limits of the primary fire district except in accordance with the procedure set forth below. 
1. The proposed construction activity will not contribute to an increased fire hazard. 
2. Permit approval process. Upon receipt of the required application, the building inspector shall circulate a copy of all application materials to the fire inspector for review and comment. 
3. Following receipt of written comments from the fire inspector, the building inspector shall review the application and then approve or deny said application. If the application is approved, it is transmitted to the board of aldermen for review. If the building inspector denies the issuance of a permit requested in accordance with these guidelines, he shall set forth the reasons for denial of said permit in writing, a copy of which shall be transmitted to the applicant so that the applicant may appeal the decision of the building inspector in accordance with the guidelines set forth below. 
4. Once approved by the building inspector, the application is transferred to the Black Mountain Board of Aldermen for review and consideration of approval or denial. If the board of aldermen approves the application, it is then forwarded to the office of the insurance commissioner for the State of North Carolina for review. If the board of aldermen denies the issuance of a permit requested in accordance with these guidelines, they shall instruct the town clerk to prepare, for the signature of the mayor, an order specifying the reasons for their denial of the request. A copy of the order of denial shall be forwarded to the applicant. Upon notification of denial, the applicant may appeal the decision of the board of aldermen in accordance with the guidelines set forth below.

The appeal from an adverse decision of the office of the commissioner of insurance may be taken to the appropriate court of jurisdiction. 
D. Appeals procedure. Appeals from any adverse decision made on the part of either the building inspector or the board of aldermen with regard to the enforcement of the primary fire district regulations may be taken to the commissioner of insurance (or designee). Said appeal may be made by filing a written notice concurrently with the office of the commissioner of insurance for the State of North Carolina and with the Town of Black Mountain Building Inspector within a period of ten days following the issuance of any order, decision, or determination. Further appeals may be taken to the building code council or to the appropriate court of jurisdiction, as provided by law.

4.7.6.1 Intent. 
The intent of the pedestrian master plan overlay is to: 
 Fulfill the comprehensive plan goal of making Black Mountain "one of the most walkable communities in the region;" 
 Implement the adopted pedestrian master plan; 
 Provide safe and convenient pedestrian and wheelchair access throughout town and in particular to connect residential areas with commercial and employment areas; 
 Promote inter-modal transportation and support transit; and 
 Maintain the small-town feel and traditional character of the town. 
4.7.6.2 Establishment of the overlay. 
This overlay district is established with adoption and any subsequent updates of the town's pedestrian master plan map. 
4.7.6.3 Regulations. 
A. Sidewalks are required for all new construction and renovations, additions and/or expansions to existing commercial structures which abut proposed public roadways, or which fall into one of the following categories: 
1. Any project adjacent to sidewalk alignments as adopted in the pedestrian master plan. 
2. All new single-family residential development which is a major subdivision of ten or more single-family homes; 
3. All new multi-family residential development or residential special use developments, of ten units or more or as required by the special use permit;

6. All new streets, improved streets or extension to streets as required by the town subdivision ordinances, or the special use permit. 
7. As a requirement of the district in which the project is located. 
B. Wherever a property abuts a proposed greenway alignment, the development plan for that property must allocate right-of-way for future construction, or may utilize greenway construction to meet pedestrian access requirements or to offset fees required in lieu of sidewalk construction (see paragraph C. below). Allocated right-of-way for the purpose of greenways may be used to fulfill open space requirements for major subdivisions and special use permits (see also chapters 3, 5, and 7). 
C. Notwithstanding the conditions of a special use or conditional use permit, a developer may choose to request a waiver for construction of sidewalk and pay a fee in lieu of actual construction as long as the following conditions are met: 
1. The applicable project area, including the street frontage, is not identified as a needed pedestrian linkage within the pedestrian plan or other adopted transportation or corridor plan, including but not limited to the transportation improvement program (TIP), or greenway master plan, or are granted approval for a waiver by the planning board. 
2. To grant a waiver for sidewalk construction, the planning board must find that: 
a. Such facilities are not in harmony with surrounding uses; or 
b. That a sidewalk in that location is unfeasible due to special circumstances, including but not limited to impending, road widening or improvements, significant street trees, or severe roadside conditions or slope which would prohibit sidewalk construction. 
3. The developer must provide a recorded easement, if necessary, for the future development of the sidewalk or greenway in accordance with the adopted master plan. The developer wherever practical shall grade for the future development of a sidewalk. 
4. Fees shall be based on the construction cost for a five-foot concrete sidewalk surface for the linear footage of property adjacent to the public roadway. 
D. All sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the standards of the Town of Black Mountain and shall be reviewed by the public works director. 
4.7.6.4 Use of fees collected in lieu of construction. 
All fees collected by the town pursuant to these provisions shall be accounted for separately from other monies, and shall be expended only for the construction or rehabilitation of sidewalks or other pedestrian improvements in the same general area as the development is located as determined by the town planning board at the time of the request. 
4.7.6.5 Appeals and variances. 
In the event that a developer wishes to appeal the ruling of the town staff or the sidewalk or greenway easement requirements, or to vary the requirements at their location, the developer must provide application with a letter explaining the reasons for their request to the town zoning administrator. The application will be forwarded to the zoning board of adjustment for their consideration. 
4.7.7 - US70 corridor overlay. 
4.7.7.1 Intent. 
The intent of the US70 corridor overlay is to: 
 Beautify the US70 corridor as a primary entrance, or "gateway," and thoroughfare through town in accordance with the 2004 comprehensive plan; 
 Promote economic development and investment along the US70 corridor; 
 Promote automobile, bicycle and pedestrian safety along the US70 corridor; 
 Implement selected recommendations from the US70 corridor study; 
 Promote inter-modal transportation and support transit; and 
 Maintain the small-town feel and traditional character of the town. 
4.7.7.2 Establishment of the overlay. 
This overlay district is established over properties and uses immediately adjacent to the US70 corridor through the jurisdiction of Black Mountain, with the exception of the central business district and the industrial districts (HI-0 and LI-8). Unless explicitly stated otherwise within the guidelines of the overlay, all other regulations of the underlying zoning district shall apply. 
4.7.7.3 Regulations. 
A. Building orientation, form and setback in relation to US70. 
1. Buildings adjoining the US70 right-of-way shall be no more than 50 feet from the curb and gutter of US70 as a maximum setback unless part of a conditional or special use permit. 
2. Buildings adjoining the US70 right-of-way shall be designed so that the building is oriented to the roadway. Buildings must have a minimum of one primary entrance opening directly toward the street and connect to the public sidewalk either directly or by a walkway or other facility such as an arcade, patio, or stairs and ramp that accommodates pedestrians and wheelchairs. 
3. Doors, glazed openings or windows, and porches are considered openings on the facade of a building. All ground level exterior walls directly facing US70, intersections, and/or other public streets shall have a minimum of 50% openings the length of the wall. 
4. Buildings shall avoid long, monotonous, uninterrupted walls or roof planes longer than 100 feet on their facades that are visible from the US70 thoroughfare. Building wall offsets, such as changes in materials, use of projections or awnings, recesses, and changes in floor level, shall be used in order to add architectural interest and variety and relieve the visual effect of a single, long wall. 
5. Changes to the roofline (such as a staggered parapet or other articulation on the roofline facing the street) shall be provided every 100 feet to meet this requirement and to lend architectural interest and variety to the massing of a building and to relieve the effect of a single, long roof. Structural signage of similar material to the building and attached to the building may be used to meet this requirement. 
6. Unless as part of a conditional or special use permit, parking areas shall be in the side or rear of the primary structure on the lot to the greatest extent practicable. The exemption to this requirement is handicapped parking spaces or parking areas providing less than 20 spaces which may be located in the front buildings. 
7. All site plans shall design landscaping along the front of the building or parking lot adjacent to the right-of-way and in accordance with the town's landscaping ordinance. 
B. Access management and property ingress and egress. 
1. All sites shall be developed in accordance with "access management" principles. Access management is the implementation of design practices intended to address organized and controlled traffic movement to minimize traffic conflict, provide efficient traffic flow, and to provide a more pedestrian-friendly development pattern. Access management should address the location and design of public street and driveway connections to the primary roadway, as well as promote site design that minimizes the total number of connections needed throughout the corridor. 
2. In order to minimize traffic conflicts at intersections, property ingress/egress shall be a minimum of 100 feet from intersections of US70 and public roads. If the property frontage is situated in such a way or is not long enough to accommodate this requirement, then the driveway shall be as far from the intersection as possible. 
3. Along US70, parcels may have a maximum of one curbcut for two-way traffic or two curbcuts for one-way traffic onto the US70 corridor. Curbcuts shall be a maximum of 25 feet for a two-way driveway, or 30 feet if driveway is to be used for truck traffic of more than two axels, or a maximum of 20 feet for one-way driveways. 
 One-way driveways shall be separated by a curbed median or planted area of minimum ten feet in width and include pavement markings with directional arrows to indicate traffic direction. Signage may be placed within this median as long as it does not interfere with the line of sight of motorists or the NCDOT right-of-way. 
4. Adjacent properties with parking lots greater than 15 spaces shall be connected and share driveways and establish joint-access agreements. Joint parking can be utilized to meet minimum parking requirements of the town. Adjacent parking lots of greater than 15 spaces are required to have interior connections to allow traffic flow within parking areas. 
5. Service entrances and alleys may be developed in addition to other driveways. Shared use and joint access to service entrances and alley ways is encouraged among multiple businesses and developments. Such alleys shall be located in the rear of buildings and should connect to side roads wherever possible.

7. In addition to other pedestrian requirements provided in the pedestrian overlay, sidewalks are required along US70 the length of property frontage and must be a minimum of five feet in width with a minimum two-foot buffer between the sidewalk and the back of curb. 
8. All curb-cuts and driveways shall include pedestrian markings of zebra stripes, textured asphalt stamping, or brick pavers or other material that visually designate the pedestrian thoroughfare and connects to the sidewalk. 
C. Loading and storage areas. 
1. All loading and storage areas shall be located to the side and/or rear of all principle structures, except single-family or duplex residential structures, fronting the highway corridor. For corner lots, the side of the lot facing the more major thoroughfare shall be considered the front yard for the purpose of this requirement. 
2. All dumpsters shall be screened from any adjacent roadways and shall be located in the side or rear of buildings and comply with screening requirements (see section 4.4.6). 
3. Mechanical equipment, utility meters, storage areas, trash enclosures, transformers, generators or other utility hardware attached to or on the building or ground shall be screened from the US70 roadway with materials similar to the structure, or be located so as not to be visible from public view from US70. 
D. Signage. 
1. All free-standing signage as allowed in the town's sign regulations, must be of monument style and incorporate some non-metal materials such as wood, brick or stone into the structure. Such signs may be lit through the use of external or internal sources only in accordance with the town lighting regulations (see chapter 9) and shall not exceed 12 feet in height. 
E. Parking areas and requirement reduction incentives for tree preservation and bicycles. 
1. When parking lots abut the sidewalk adjacent to US70, a planted buffer area of average of six-feet-wide, and a minimum of three-feet-wide is required to separate the sidewalk from the parking lot. The buffer shall contain continuous landscaping of shrubbery and/or flower beds, or plantings. Where a parking lot abuts the sidewalk along US70 for a length of more than 200 linear feet, then a break in the landscaping and a pedestrian connection to the parking area is required. 
2. Town parking requirements may be decreased according to one or more of the following criteria within the overlay district: 
a. Two to four parking spaces may be waived in exchange for the preservation of one established tree of 24 inches diameter or greater within a parking lot, up to 20 spaces in exchange for established trees per acre. The "Tree Protection Zone" is a minimum area equal to the area of a circle having a radius in feet equal to the tree diameter in inches (24-inch diameter of tree would require a 24-foot radius area). A tree protection zone must be incorporated into the site plan and preserved throughout construction. This area may serve more than one tree as long as the protection zone is adequately designated and maintained. These protected areas for larger trees can count toward the landscaping and parking lot island requirement of the town. 
b. A developer may choose the option of replacing one automobile space with four bicycle parking spaces, (or two spaces for eight bicycle parking spots, or three for 12) up to a maximum of 16 bicycle parking spaces in place of four automobile spaces. 
c. A developer may share parking through a joint-use agreement with another business or entity or group of businesses/entities. The number of spaces required for that business shall be determined by zoning administrator based on a negotiated joint-use agreement among businesses and the projected combined parking needs of the businesses involved. 

CHAPTER 5. - ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIED USES 
SECTION 5.1 - PURPOSE 

5.1.1 - Purpose. 
    The Town of Black Mountain finds that there are certain uses that exist which may be constructed, continued, and/or expanded provided they meet certain mitigating requirements specific to their design and/or operation. Such additional requirements ensure compatibility with other uses and conformance to the town's comprehensive plan or other adopted plans. This chapter specifies those requirements that must be met by all the uses listed in the uses permitted with additional requirements section for each district in chapter 4. 
    Each use shall be permitted in compliance with all additional requirements listed for the use in this chapter. Certain uses are also classified as conditional uses or special uses and require board of adjustment approval per chapters 6 and 7.

    Adult establishments, because of their nature, are recognized as having characteristics which may be objectionable to nearby residential districts and certain other uses considered to be sensitive, namely churches, schools, parks, libraries, day care centers, nursing homes, and medical centers. Studies have shown that properties tend to be devalued and crime rates tend to be increased by the concentration of adult establishments. The board of aldermen determines that regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects do not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of nearby residential districts and to protect the integrity of those sensitive uses listed above. These regulations are found in chapter 9 of the Town Code of Ordinances and as follows. An adult establishment is any structure or use of land that is defined in G.S. 14-202.10. 
5.3.2 - Regulations.

This shall not apply to residences constructed after the establishment of such livestock containment area. However, the containment area may not encroach further towards the newly established residence. 
9.  In residential and mixed-use districts, chickens are allowed but must be in an enclosed area in the side or rear yard, and any structures associated with the housing of chickens shall meet the accessory building requirements of this chapter. Roosters are only permitted in the industrial districts (HI-0 and LI-8) and CR-1 district. 
10.  This section shall not apply to cats, dogs, rabbits, or similar household pets. 
D.  In the CB, NMU-8, and UR-8 districts agricultural uses related to livestock and animal husbandry of any type, with the exemption of household pets or chickens, are prohibited.

SECTION 7.4 - GENERAL REGULATIONS 

7.4.1 - General regulations. 
A.  Special use developments must meet the density requirements of the district in which they are located unless they qualify as a cottage housing development (eight units per acre) or opt for the "inclusionary density bonus" (see inclusionary development options and chapter 12). 
B.  Qualifying developments for the inclusionary density bonus provide a ten-percent set aside for residential units to be sold at affordable price points as established by Buncombe County AMI up to ten units per acre (or one unit for every ten units developed). So for example, if the maximum density for the district is eight units per acre, the SUP plan may include ten units per acre if one of the units is sold at AMI thresholds. 
C.  If a developer provides 25 percent of their units at an affordable price point (one unit for every four), then they can have an additional density bonus up to 16 units per acre, according to the zoning district in which they are located. (See chapter 12). 
D.  The perimeter of special use developments must meet the setback requirements of the district in which they are located unless otherwise specified in this chapter or as a condition enumerated by the zoning board of adjustment as part of the permit. 
E.  Special uses must meet the requirements and standards as specified in this chapter, as well as other town requirements and standards as applicable. 
SECTION 7.5 - SPECIAL USE: CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS 

7.5.1 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of a conservation subdivision is to provide flexibility in subdivision design in order to protect the natural landscape, mountain ecology, and view-shed of the Town of Black Mountain. 
7.5.2 - Applicability. 
    This subdivision option may be applied in any subdivision and in any zoning district in which conservation subdivisions are permitted, which the original tract or total of assembled tracts is one acre or more. 
7.5.3 - Density, lot sizes, and setbacks. 
A.  Conservation subdivision plans meeting the requirements of this chapter shall be allowed twice the density permitted per acre under the density table for steep slopes in the erosion prevention and slope protection ordinance (applicable to lots of 25 percent slope or greater) and shall be exempt from the minimum lot size. Under no circumstances however shall the gross density of a conservation subdivision exceed the density for the district in which it is located or as allowed by the inclusionary housing allowance. 
B.  Yard setbacks are not required within the development but must be maintained on the perimeter of the project boundary. 
C.  Building sites, including accessory buildings, must be established based on the site capacity analysis which identifies the areas for construction with the most stability and the least amount of land disturbance, while preserving environmentally sensitive areas. 
D.  Lot sizes may vary from the minimum lot size of the district in which the subdivision is located so long as the overall density of the district is maintained and any reduction in the area of individual lots is provided in a minimum of equal area dedicated as common open space as part of the master plan. This allowance shall apply to single-family and zero-lot-line construction. 
E.  Within and adjoining established residential districts, a ten-foot setback from the side and rear property lines must be preserved. 
7.5.4 - Performance goals. 
    A conservation subdivision plan is a "performance-based" development plan that is flexible in its requirements as long as the following goals are achieved: 
A.  Environmentally sensitive areas are left undisturbed, including: 
1.  Any slope greater than 45 degrees, exceeding a 1:1 slope or 100 percent slope. 
2.  Wetlands, bogs and natural drainages. 
3.  Perennial and intermittent streams with a 30-foot protective buffer on both sides. 
4.  Significant landscape features. Significant landscape features may include rock outcroppings, trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) of two feet or more, or other landscape characteristics which are unique to the site, rare in the area, or which are visually or biologically unusual. 
B.  Stormwater run-off is managed in such a way as to conform to the natural hydrology of the site and resulting in run-off that is equal to or less than the pre-development conditions. Low impact development ("LID") is the preferred stormwater design strategy that seeks to maintain or replicate the pre-development hydrology of a site by using design techniques to create a functionally equivalent hydrologic landscape. The strategy seeks to maintain the functions of storage, infiltration, and groundwater recharge, as well as the volume and frequency of discharges by the use of integrated and distributed micro-scale stormwater retention and detention areas, reduction of impervious surfaces, and the lengthening of flow paths and runoff time. 
C.  Colluvial soils are avoided. 
D.  No more than 33 percent of total land area is disturbed in the development process, 
E.  Buildings, driveways and roads are located in the most stable areas for construction and along contours that require the least amount of land disturbance and cut-and-fill. 
F.  Native plants existing on the site pre-development are minimally disturbed and native plants occurring naturally on the site are also incorporated into post-construction landscaping. 
G.  When adjoining or located within established residential districts, a ten-foot setback from the side and rear property lines must be preserved. 
H.  A site analysis which indicates how the master plan addresses the six goals above and documents the pre-development and post-development stormwater run-off conditions. 
7.5.5 - General design requirements. 
    In addition the requirements for a master plan required by this chapter, the following design requirements shall be conservation developments: 
A.  An LID analysis of the natural hydrology and how the stormwater management plan is consistent with that hydrology. This analysis should include calculations for run-off based on the amount of impervious surface proposed, and how the run-off will be managed on-site. 
B.  The disturbed area does not exceed 33 percent of the total tract area, and the location and footprint of buildings and roads are located in such a way as to minimize impact for the particular site. 
C.  The plan meets or exceeds the overall density requirements of the district in which it is located. 
D.  Buildings may not be more than 35 feet in height from the highest adjacent grade. A building may not exceed 45 feet in height on any one side. 
E.  The subdivision development, including roads and buildings, shall be designed to meet the standards of the town's insurance rating as determined by the town's fire inspector. 
F.  All roads must follow pre-disturbance land contours in order to minimize cut and fill to the greatest extent possible. Designs with bifurcated, one-way, or variable travel widths may be included within the plan if periodic turnouts, one-way loops, bifurcations, or other designs are applied that allow for staging and passing of public vehicles.

FIG. 7.1 CONSERVATION DEVELOPMENT EXAMPLE*
SECTION 7.6 - SPECIAL USE: COTTAGE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT (CHDS) 

7.6.1 - Purpose. 
    The purposes of this type of development and these accompanying guidelines are to: 
 Provide a housing type that responds to changing household sizes and ages (e.g., retirees, small families, single person households); 
 Provide opportunities for ownership of small, detached dwelling units within all districts; encourage creation of more usable open space for residents of the development through flexibility in density and lot standards; 
 Preserve a housing type of small, free-standing cabins and cottages, a housing style that has historically existed in Black Mountain since its development as a retreat and vacation destination and to provide guidelines to ensure compatibility with surrounding land uses; and 
 To accommodate and encourage new types of housing options such as "Katrina Cottages," and free-standing structures of small footprint that are generally more affordable, energy efficient and sensitive to the land. 
7.6.2 - Applicability. 
    A cottage is a small, detached dwelling unit, not greater than 1,100 square feet in total floor area that may be developed at a density greater than the underlying zone. More than two cottages may occupy a single lot and may be owned separately as long as there are existing agreements for the maintenance and use of common areas. A cottage development may be developed in any zoning district except for HI-0. 
7.6.3 - Density. 
    Cottage housing developments shall contain a minimum of two free-standing structures located in a cluster to encourage a sense of community among the residents. A development site may contain more than one cottage housing development, but in no case shall a single cottage housing development exceed eight units per acre unless meeting specifications for the inclusionary housing bonus, in which up to ten units per acre are allowed. 
7.6.4 - General design requirements. 
    In addition to the general requirements of this chapter, the following guidelines shall be met: 
A.  Setbacks for all structures from the adjacent property lines along the perimeter of the site shall comply with all setback requirements of the district in which the development is located. 
B.  The minimum distance between structures, including accessory buildings, shall be ten feet, and must have off-set windows and all fire safety codes related to building proximity and fire rated walls shall be met. 
C.  The maximum built-upon area, including parking, driveways and buildings, shall be equal to or less than 66 percent of the total land area for the lot. 
D.  Maximum height for cottages shall be 35 feet and the maximum height for accessory structures shall be 18 feet. All parts of the cottage roof above 18 feet shall be pitched. 
E.  Cottages must have a stoop or front porch that shall have a roofed porch at least 80 square feet in size with a minimum dimension of eight feet on any side. 
F.  A pitched roof design is required for all parking structures. 
G.  Cottages must not exceed 1,100 square feet of enclosed, habitable space. Cottage areas that do not count toward the total floor area calculation are: 
1.  Unheated storage space located under the main floor of the cottage. 
2.  Architectural projections such as bay windows, fireplaces or utility closets not greater than 18 inches in depth or six feet in width. 
3.  Attached roofed porches. 
4.  Detached garages or carports. 
5.  Spaces with a ceiling height of six feet or less measured to the exterior walls, such as in a second floor area under the slope of the roof. 
H.  Accessory buildings and detached or attached garages or carports shall not exceed 200 square feet in size, shall match the architecture of the cottages in style and material, and shall not be used for residential purposes. 
I.  Parking spaces may be spread out through the development connected to each cottage, clustered in a shared parking lot or some combination thereof at a minimum ratio of two spaces per unit; clustered parking for more than six vehicles must be screened from public streets and adjacent residential uses by landscaping or architectural screening. 
J.  Driveways and parking areas and any common open space, parks or stormwater management facilities, shall be considered common areas and must be maintained by an established neighborhood association. 
K.  The total square foot area of a cottage dwelling unit may not be increased. A note shall be placed on the title to the property for the purpose of notifying future property owners that any increase in the total square footage of a cottage is prohibited for the life of the cottage or duration of cottage regulations. 
L.  Common area shall be outside of wet stormwater ponds, wetlands, streams, lakes, and sensitive areas and maintained. Private open space shall provide a private area around the individual dwellings to enable diversity in landscape design. Requirements: 
1.  Common open space shall be a minimum of 400 square feet per cottage, abut at least 50 percent of the cottages in a cottage housing development, and have cottages abutting on at least two sides. 
2.  Private open space shall be a minimum of 300 square feet or private, contiguous, usable space adjacent to each dwelling unit, for the exclusive use of the cottage resident. It shall be oriented toward the common open space as much as possible or in the rear or side yard areas with no dimension less than ten feet. 
M.  An existing detached or attached single-family dwelling that is incorporated into a cottage housing development as a residence and is nonconforming with respect to the standards of this section shall be permitted to remain on a site used for a cottage housing development. However, the extent of the non-compliance may not be increased unless the proposed change is determined by the zoning administrator to be consistent in character, scale and design with the cottage housing development. If the existing dwelling meets the requirements of this section with regard to size and is able to conform to other site standards, it may be counted as a cottage in the density calculation for the site. If the existing dwelling does not meet the size limitation for a cottage, then it shall count as one standard size dwelling.

CHAPTER 8. - LAND DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS 
SECTION 8.1 - EROSION PREVENTION AND SLOPE PROTECTION ORDINANCE 

8.1.1 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the environment of the Town of Black Mountain and the health, safety and public welfare of its citizens by establishing minimum requirements concerning land disturbance and to control the potential adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation. 
8.1.2 - Applicability. 
A.  Beginning with and subsequent to its effective date, this ordinance shall be applicable to all development and redevelopment, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading projects within the Town of Black Mountain's jurisdiction. 
B.  Grading permits shall be required whenever 5,000 square feet or more of land is disturbed. The addition of impervious surface of 5,000 square feet or more or of a cumulative land disturbance of land of 12,000 square feet or more shall also require a town stormwater permit. 
C.  Grading shall mean any manipulation of the ground forms including, but not limited to cutting of trees with excavation of stumps or any other earth-disturbing activities; provided, (a) that installation of utilities in an area with a topographical change of not more than five percent where the area disturbed is not wider than 18 inches (including ditch and spill areas); and (b) that creation of stormwater drainage and erosion control ditches except when the ditch is located in an existing natural drainage channel and the only improvement is the lining of the channel with rock, shall not be considered grading. 
D.  For any area designated as a "steep slope", land disturbance shall mean any use of, or operations on, the land by any person in residential, industrial, educational, institutional, or commercial development, highway and road construction and maintenance that results in a change in the natural cover or topography and that may cause or contribute to sedimentation. However, the cutting of scattered individual trees, the removal of fallen trees and the removal of undesirable non-native or invasive vines, shrubs and plants will be allowed. 
E.  Any grading or other land disturbing activity within the floodplain shall be reviewed by the floodplain administrator to determine applicability of floodplain regulations and associated permits. 
8.1.3 - Cut and fill slopes. 
A.  Property being developed within the Town of Black Mountain shall not exceed the following specifications for cut and fill: 
1.  Cut slopes shall not exceed a ratio of greater than 1:1 (horizontal distance to vertical distance, or a 45 degree slope angle, or 100 percent grade); and 
2.  Fill slopes shall not exceed a ratio of greater than 1.5:1 (horizontal distance to vertical distance, or a 33 degree slope angle, or 66 percent grade). 
B.  Roads exceeding 15 percent grade and proposed for dedication to the town as public streets shall include roadway design and engineering with benching or other stabilization techniques as part of the site plan and shall include a town maintenance easement to the toe of the slope. 
C.  All cut and fill slopes shall be hydro-seeded or landscaped within 30 days of achievement of final grade and all temporary roads and slopes shall not be left exposed for more than a 45-day period. 
D.  Retaining walls greater than five feet in height must be designed and sealed by an engineer and approved by the town's building inspector. 
Notes on Slope:Slope is the measurement of "rise" in vertical distance in relation to horizontal distance, or "run." Slope ratio is expressed as horizontal distance (to): vertical distance   % slope is calculated as: Vertical Distance 
Horizontal Distance × 100   1:1 slope (or 45 degree slope angle) = 100%   1.5:1 slope (or 33 degree slope angle) = 66% slope*   2:1 slope (or 26.6 degree slope angle) = 50% slope   3:1 slope (or 18 degree slope angle) = 33.5% slope   4:1 slope (or 14 degree slope angle) = 25%   6.5:1 slope (or 8.7 degree slope angle) = 15% slope Without using more advanced stabilization techniques, the maximum slope to be considered for vegetative stabilization is 1.5:1.  
Table 8.1.03 
8.1.4 - Sedimentation and erosion control. 
A.  Any land disturbance permitted under Buncombe County's Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Office must be documented before any grading activity may take place. Buncombe County enforces the state "Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973" for the Town of Black Mountain and regulates certain land disturbing activities for the purpose of controlling accelerated erosion and sedimentation in order to prevent the pollution of water and other damage to lakes, water courses and other public and private property by sedimentation. 
B.  Land disturbing activity or grading in connection with development or redevelopment on a site that requires a building permit, and that does not fall under the Sedimentation and Pollution Control Act of 1973, such as that under one acre of land, shall comply with the following requirements: 
1.  A written or graphic concept plan of the proposed soil and sedimentation controls during construction shall be submitted with the grading permit. Concept plan shall include identification of areas of land disturbance within the site and the location of proposed temporary and permanent soil erosion and sedimentation control measures designed to retain sediment on-site. 
2.  Land disturbing activity shall not take place within twenty-five feet of a stream or otherwise result in a violation of rules adopted by the state environmental management commission to protect riparian buffers along state surface waters. In accordance with state and local stormwater management regulations, no built-upon area shall be within 30 feet of a stream. 
3.  Land disturbing activity shall not result in a violation of any local ordinance including but not limited to zoning district requirements and floodplain regulations. 
4.  Erosion control measures in compliance with the approved plan and building permit shall be in place before construction may begin. Failure to comply will result in a stop work order. 
5.  Any required permanent erosion control measures or landscaping shall be in place before grading permit is issued or shall be bonded at 125 percent of the estimated cost for implementation of the landscaping plan. Measures and landscaping shall be in place within 45 days of final grade. 
8.1.5 - Designation of steep slopes and hillside requirements. 
A.  Steep slope and hillside regulations apply to any subdivision or development that meets the following criteria: 
1.  A development or redevelopment project or subdivision located on a parcel greater than one acre and in which the average of the natural slope for the entire parcel is 16 percent or greater; or 
2.  A development or redevelopment project or subdivision of a parcel less than one acre in which the average natural slope of 25 percent or greater; or 
3.  A development or redevelopment project or subdivision, where 50 percent or more of the subdivision lies at or above elevations of 2,600 feet above mean sea level or greater. 
B.  Any portion of the lot, parcel, or tract of land which has been approved by the planning department or planning board as a minor or major subdivision or special use permit prior to the adoption of this section, or developed prior to the adoption of this section, or any lot pre-existing before the adoption of this section, shall not be subject to the minimum lot size requirement as stated in this chapter. Subsequent phases of, or additions to, a minor or major subdivision or special use permit, as well as approved subdivision projects where the site plan has been changed, or approved subdivisions where the lot design has changed, shall indicate the proposed contours, limit and area of grading, and percentage of the site to be graded and shall comply with the requirements of these regulations. 
C.  Slope calculations shall use the smallest contour interval for which maps are available or at a minimum of five-foot intervals, and shall be determined based on the tract to be subdivided, irrespective of proposed subdivision boundaries if part of a minor or major subdivision. The average slope is calculated using the following formula: 
S% = 0.0023×I×L 
  A  
Where: 
S = Average natural slope of parcel or lot in percent 
I = Contour interval of map in feet, with contour intervals to be five feet or less 
L = Total length of the contour lines within the parcel or lot in feet 
A = Area of the parcel or lot in acres 
0.0023 = Constant which converts square feet into acres 
Property owners may submit an alternate method of slope calculation for consideration based on the peculiarities of the site and prepared by a member of the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA), Professional Engineer (P.E.), Professional Land Surveyor or be a qualified environmental scientist. These methods may include, but are not limited to, weighted average, slope mapping, or other field-based techniques, etc. 
Once "S" or the average natural percent slope of the tract is calculated, it shall be rounded off to the nearest whole number on the density and lot size table, as set forth hereinafter, which shall be used to determine the maximum number of lots or units allowed. 
D.  In addition to the application requirements submitted for review, proposed projects which meet the standards of the hillside area definition must include the following information: 
1.  Average natural slope calculations which include the average natural slope in percent, contour intervals of five feet or less, individual and total length of contour lines in feet and area of the parcel in acres; 
2.  Subdivision for the purpose of conservation in perpetuity may allow developers to subtract areas for conservation from the total acreage used to calculate average slope of the original lot. 
3.  Areas exceeding 16 percent slope shall be indicated on all site plans, development plans, preliminary plats, and special use permit plan applications. 
4.  Soils maps shall be submitted if available from the natural resource conservation service (NRCS) and deposits of known colluvial soils shall be located on the site plan. 
5.  Consultation with a geotechnical engineer shall be required for road, driveway, or home construction in areas of a tract in excess of 36 percent natural slope and an investigation for colluvial deposits shall be made. Recommendations of the geotechnical engineer shall be submitted with the application for review by staff or by the planning board if part of a major subdivision or special use permit application. 
6.  Homesites on a 36-percent or greater slope shall include a global stability analysis with the building permit. 
7.  Homesites on a 25-percent or greater slope must conform to the following density table in addition to the minimum zoning requirements. Conservation subdivision plans shall be allowed twice the density permitted per acre under the Density Table for Steep Slopes in the erosion prevention and slope protection ordinance (applicable to lots of 25 percent slope or greater) and shall be exempt from the minimum lot size. Under no circumstances however shall the gross density of a conservation subdivision exceed the density for the district in which it is located. 
8.  Wherever the minimum lot size for the district and the density table are in conflict, the regulation of the greatest lot size shall apply:

Extensive grading shall be avoided and low impact development ("LID") techniques which meet the town's stormwater requirements are required. 
10.  On any tract greater than one acre proposed for subdivision or construction, no more than 50 percent of the tract shall be graded or disturbed. 
11.  Streets, right-of-ways, pedestrian facilities and setbacks shall be designed to minimize impact on steep slope areas of the particular site without compromising the town's ability to provide connectivity, street maintenance, waste management, or fire protection, and must be designed to the approval of the town's fire marshall and public works director. Street standards may be allowed a staff variance of up to 20 percent (up to eight feet variation on right-of-way requirements, and up to 4.8 feet variation on total travel surface requirements), based on topography, traffic and public safety needs. Subdivisions complying with the conservation subdivision plan requirements (chapter 13) do not have to meet the setback requirements for the zoning district. However, the location and lay-out of streets, lots buildings, and pedestrian facilities should minimize environmental impact. 
12.  All major subdivisions meeting steep slope and hillside criteria and of ten acres or more must adhere to the conservation subdivision plan guidelines in chapter 7. 
13.  Reserved. 
14.  Issuance of land disturbing permit. No land disturbing permit shall be issued for a site plan review or a subdivision review which meets the standards set forth in the definition of hillside area until the site plan review and subdivision plat review have been completed.

8.2.1 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment as well as illicit discharges into municipal stormwater systems. Proper management of construction-related and post development stormwater runoff will prevent surface water quality degradation to the extent practicable in the streams and lakes within town jurisdiction. 
    This ordinance seeks to meet the requirements of the town's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit and its general purposes through: 
1.  Establishing decision-making processes for development that protects the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources; 
2.  Requiring new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
3.  Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
4.  Establishing design and review criteria for the construction, function, and use of structural stormwater BMPs to meet post-development stormwater management standards; 
5.  Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices, such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable; 
6.  Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no threat to public safety; 
7.  Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, for the inspection of approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance; 
8.  Coordinating site design plans that include open space and natural areas with the Town of Black Mountain's goals for the protection of open space and natural areas; 
9.  Controlling illicit discharges into the municipal separate stormwater system; and 
10.  Controlling erosion and sedimentation from construction activities.

G.  When used in this ordinance, the following words and terms shall have the meaning set forth in this section, unless other provisions of this ordinance specifically indicate otherwise. 
    Built-upon area (BUA): That portion of a development project that is covered by impervious or partially impervious surface including, but not limited to, buildings; pavement and gravel areas such as roads, parking lots, and paths; and recreation facilities such as tennis courts. "Built-upon area" does not include a wooden slatted deck, the water area of a swimming pool, or pervious or partially pervious paving material to the extent that the paving material absorbs water or allows water to infiltrate. 
    Best management practices 3. or "BMPs": control urban stormwater runoff and can include "structural BMPs" such as infiltration devices, ponds, filters and constructed wetlands; and "non-structural BMPs such as maintenance practices, street sweeping, public education and outreach programs. 
    Design manual: 4. The stormwater design manual approved for use in phase II jurisdictions by the North Carolina Division of Water Quality. The design manual includes a local appendix of recommendations for BMPs that any property owner could utilize to help in managing stormwater. All references herein to the design manual are to the latest published edition or revision. 
    Development: Any land disturbing activity that increases the amount of built upon area or that otherwise decreases the infiltration of precipitation into the soil. 
    High-density project: Any project that exceeds the low-density threshold for dwelling units per acre (two dwelling units per acre) or built-upon area (24%). 
    Larger common plan of development or sale: Any area where multiple separate and distinct construction or land disturbing activities will occur under one plan. A plan is any announcement or piece of documentation (including but not limited to a sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch, advertisement, loan application, drawing, permit application, zoning request, or computer design) or physical demarcation (including but not limited to boundary signs, lot stakes, or surveyor markings) indicating that construction activities may occur on a specific plot. 
    Low-density project: A project that has no more than two dwelling units per acre or 24 percent built-upon area (BUA) for all residential and non-residential development. 
    One-year, 24-hour storm: The surface runoff resulting from a 24-hour rainfall of an intensity expected to be equaled or exceeded, on average, once in 12 months and with a duration of 24 hours.

    Structural BMP: A physical device designed to trap, settle out, or filter pollutants from stormwater runoff; to alter or reduce stormwater runoff velocity, amount, timing, or other characteristics; to approximate the pre-development hydrology on a developed site; or to achieve any combination of these goals. Structural BMP includes physical practices such as constructed wetlands, vegetative practices, filter strips, grassed swales, and other methods installed or created on real property. "Structural BMP" is synonymous with "structural practice", "stormwater control facility," "stormwater control practice," "stormwater treatment practice," "stormwater management practice," "stormwater control measures," "structural stormwater treatment systems," and similar terms used in this ordinance. 
    Substantial progress: For the purposes of determining whether sufficient progress has been made on an approved plan, one or more of the following construction activities toward the completion of a site or subdivision plan shall occur: obtaining a grading permit and conducting grading activity on a continuous basis and not discontinued for more than 30 days; or installation of on-site infrastructure; or obtaining a building permit for the construction and approval of a building foundation. "Substantial progress" for purposes of determining whether an approved plan is null and void is not necessarily the same as "substantial expenditures" used for determining vested rights pursuant to applicable law. 
8.2.4 - Design manual. 
A.  The planning director or his/her designee shall use the policy, criteria, and information, including technical specifications and standards, in the design manual as the basis for decisions about stormwater permits and about the design, implementation and performance of structural and non-structural stormwater BMPs. 
B.  The design manual includes a list of acceptable stormwater treatment practices, including specific design criteria for each stormwater practice. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards of the phase II laws. If the specifications or guidelines of the design manual are more restrictive or apply a higher standard than other laws or regulations, that fact shall not prevent application of the specifications in the design manual. 
C.  Changes to standards and specifications. If the standards, specifications, guidelines, policies, criteria, or other information in the design manual are amended subsequent to the submittal of an application for approval pursuant to this ordinance but prior to approval, the new information shall control and shall be utilized in reviewing the application and in implementing this ordinance with regard to the application. 
D.  The local appendix to the design manual shall provide a selection of low cost BMPs for controlling stormwater on-site as part of development or redevelopment that is exempt from this ordinance for public reference as all property owners are encouraged to implement some form of run-off controls. 
8.2.5 - Private agreements. 
    This ordinance is not intended to revoke or repeal any easement, covenant, or other private agreement. However, where the regulations of this ordinance are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than such easement, covenant, or other private agreement, then the requirements of this ordinance shall govern.

In no case shall the town be obligated to enforce the provisions of any easements, covenants, or agreements between private parties. 
8.2.6 - Severability. 
    If provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this ordinance shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this ordinance. 
8.2.7 - Effective date and transitional provisions. 
    This ordinance shall take effect on July 1, 2007. All development and redevelopment projects for which complete and full applications were submitted and approved by the Town of Black Mountain, or for which conditional use permits have been issued, prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall be exempt from complying with provisions of this ordinance dealing with the control and/or management of post-construction runoff, but shall be required to comply with all other applicable provisions. 
    Any violation of provisions existing on the effective date of this ordinance shall continue to be a violation under this ordinance and be subject to penalties and enforcement under this ordinance unless the use, development, construction, or other activity complies with the provisions of this ordinance.

B.  Effect of permit. A stormwater permit shall govern the design, installation, and construction of stormwater management and control practices on the site, including structural BMPs and elements of site design for stormwater management other than structural BMPs. The permit is intended to provide a mechanism for the review, approval, and inspection of the approach to be used for the management and control of stormwater for the development or redevelopment site consistent with the requirements of this ordinance, whether the approach consists of structural BMPs or other techniques such as low-impact or low-density design. 
C.  The permit does not continue in existence indefinitely after the completion of the project; rather, compliance after project construction is assured by the maintenance provisions of this ordinance and requires an annual submission of a maintenance inspection report on each structural BMP, conducted by a qualified professional. 
D.  Authority to file applications. All applications required pursuant to this code shall be submitted to the stormwater administrator by the land owner or the land owner's duly authorized agent along with the building permit and zoning permit applications. 
E.  Fees and submission. The Town of Black Mountain Board of Aldermen shall establish a fee schedule and stormwater review policy which may be amended and updated at the board's direction. 
F.  Applications must be complete and submitted to the planning department along with the appropriate fee established pursuant to this section. If the stormwater administrator finds that an application is incomplete, the applicant shall be notified of the deficient elements and shall be provided with an opportunity to submit a complete application. Before a stormwater management permit application is deemed complete, the stormwater administrator or developer may request a consultation on a concept plan for the post-construction stormwater management system to be utilized in the proposed development project. This consultation meeting should take place at the time of the technical review of the preliminary plan of a subdivision, special use or other early step in the development process. 
G.  The stormwater administrator shall review the application and make a determination whether the application complies with the standards of this ordinance and try to provide this review within 15 working days. Failure to receive a response from the stormwater administrator within a 15-day period however does not imply approval of the permit, and applicants are encouraged to contact the planning department if they have not received a response after the 15-day target period. 
1.  Approval. If the stormwater administrator finds that the application complies with the standards of this ordinance, the stormwater administrator shall approve the application. The stormwater administrator may impose conditions of approval as needed to ensure compliance with this ordinance. The conditions shall be included as part of the approval. 
2.  Fails to comply. If the stormwater administrator finds that the application fails to comply with the standards of this ordinance, the stormwater administrator shall notify the applicant and shall indicate how the application fails to comply. The applicant shall have an opportunity to submit a revised application. 
3.  Revision and subsequent review. A complete revised application shall be reviewed by the stormwater administrator after its re-submittal and shall be approved, approved with conditions or disapproved. One re-submittal of a revised application may be submitted without payment of an additional permit review fee. 
4.  If a revised application is not re-submitted within 30 working days from the date the applicant was notified, the application shall be considered withdrawn, and a new submittal for the same or substantially the same project shall be required along with the appropriate fee. 
H.  The stormwater permit application shall describe in detail how post-development stormwater run-off will be controlled and managed, the design of all stormwater facilities and practices, and how the proposed project will meet the requirements of this ordinance. The following information should also be included in the submittal: 
1.  Existing conditions/proposed site plans. Existing conditions and proposed site layout sketch plans, which illustrate at a minimum: Existing and proposed topography; perennial and intermittent streams; mapping of predominant soils from soil surveys (when available); boundaries of existing predominant vegetation and proposed limits of clearing and grading; and location of existing and proposed roads, buildings, parking areas and other impervious surfaces. 
2.  Natural resources inventory. A written or graphic inventory of the natural resources at the site and surrounding area as it exists prior to the commencement of the project. This description should include a discussion of soil conditions, forest cover, geologic features, topography, wetlands, and native vegetative areas on the site, as well as the location and boundaries of other natural feature protection and conservation areas such as lakes, ponds, floodplains, stream buffers and other setbacks (e.g., drinking water well setbacks, septic setbacks, etc.). Particular attention should be paid to environmentally sensitive features that provide particular opportunities or constraints for development. 
3.  Stormwater management system plan. A written or graphic concept plan of the proposed post-development stormwater management system including: preliminary selection and location of proposed structural stormwater controls; low impact design elements; location of existing and proposed conveyance systems such as grass channels, swales, and storm drains; flow paths; location of floodplain/floodway limits; relationship of site to upstream and downstream properties and drainages; and preliminary location of proposed stream channel modifications, such as bridge or culvert crossings. 
4.  All stormwater management plans relating to subdivisions or development or redevelopment plans on lots equal to or greater than one acre or on lots less than an acre which are part of a larger common plan of development or sale, including a subdivision, planned unit development, or other special use shall be prepared by a qualified registered North Carolina professional engineer, environmental scientist or landscape architect, and the consulting professional shall perform services only in their area of competence, and shall verify that the design of all stormwater management facilities and practices meets the submittal requirements for complete applications, and that the designs and plans are sufficient to comply with this ordinance. 
I.  As-built plans and final approval. Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted, the applicant shall certify that the completed project is in accordance with the approved stormwater management plans and designs, and shall submit actual "as built" plans for all stormwater management facilities or practices after final construction is completed. 
1.  The plans shall show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and practices and the field location, size, depth, and planted vegetation of all measures, controls, and devices, as installed. 
2.  The designer of the stormwater management measures and plans shall certify, under seal, that the as-built stormwater measures, controls, and devices are in compliance with the approved stormwater management plans and designs and with the requirements of this ordinance. 
3.  A final inspection and approval by the stormwater administrator shall occur before the release of any performance securities or a certificate of occupancy is issued. 
4.  Approval authorizes the applicant to go forward with only the specific plans and activity authorized in the permit. The approval shall not be construed to exempt the applicant from obtaining other applicable approvals from local, state, and federal authorities. 
J.  An approved plan shall become null and void if the applicant has failed to make substantial progress on the site within one year after the date of approval. The stormwater administrator may grant a single, one-year extension of this time limit, for good cause shown, upon receiving a written request from the applicant before the expiration of the approved plan. 
K.  Right of appeal. Any aggrieved person affected by any decision, order, requirement, or determination relating to the interpretation or application of this ordinance and made by the acting stormwater administrator may file an appeal to the planning department for a hearing by the zoning board of adjustment within 30 days of the determination of the application per their procedures. Every decision of the zoning board of adjustment shall be subject to superior court review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Petition for review by the superior court shall be filed with the clerk of superior court within 30 days after the zoning board of adjustment hearing. 
8.2.10 - General standards. 
    Until such time as a comprehensive watershed management plan for the Swannanoa Basin is developed, the following guidelines apply. 
A.  All built-upon area shall be at a minimum of 30 feet landward on all sides of any surface water as measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to a vertical line marking the edge of the top of the bank. A perennial or intermittent surface water shall be present if the feature is approximately shown on either the most recent version of the soil survey map prepared by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture or the most recent version of the 1:24,000 scale (7.5 minute) quadrangle topographic maps prepared by the United States Geologic Survey (USGS). An exception to this requirement may be allowed when surface waters are not present in accordance with the provisions of 15A NCAC 2B .0233 (3)(a) or similar site-specific determination made using Division of Water Quality-approved methodology. 
B.  Encroachment allowance for access within 30-foot buffer requirements (see also 4.3.2). Lots which include or are adjacent to perennial or intermittent surface waters as indicated on the most recent version of the 1:24,000 scale quadrangle topographic maps prepared by the USGS are subject to a 30-foot setback from the top of the bank of that surface water in accordance with phase II stormwater regulations. Pre-existing lots and those areas identified in adopted master plans are allowed a minimum encroachment into the 30-foot buffer for the purpose of transportation and access if the following criteria are met: 
1.  It is for the purpose of vehicle or non-motorized transportation and access only, such as trails, greenways, walkways, driveways, alleyways or access roads. Residential, accessory or commercial structures are not included in this encroachment allowance. 
2.  Utility structures that follow the right-of-way for the access are only allowed within the disturbance area of the roadway, an existing utility easement or bridge structural footprint. 
3.  It is the minimum encroachment necessary for access of the property, or is part of a trail, sidewalk or street alignment included on the town's pedestrian master plan, greenway plan or transportation plan or other approved master plan. 
4.  The encroachment area does not exceed more than ten percent of the total land area within the required buffer area, and shall never exceed more than 100 feet of linear disturbance for 1,000 feet of linear stream. 
5.  Provides the minimum area of disturbance needed for access and includes mitigation of stream and stream bank disturbance as part of the design. 
6.  Encroachments which include stream crossings should be designed so that crossing is perpendicular to the stream centerline to the maximum extent practicable. 
7.  Encroachments which are parallel to the watercourse should be designed to incorporate the maximum buffer practicable and still allow the necessary encroachment. Additional stormwater management techniques to slow and filtrate run-off shall be included between the disturbed area and the waterway. Such parallel encroachments may be subject to additional review by the state division of water quality. 
Any encroachment into the required surface water buffer setback which exceeds this allowance shall require a variance from the zoning board of adjustment. 
C.  All other projects which are not exempt from this ordinance must submit a stormwater management plan in order to receive a permit. 
D.  The approval of the stormwater permit shall require an enforceable restriction on property usage that runs with the land, such as a recorded deed restriction or protective covenants, or designated space on an approved preliminary plat or master plan to ensure that future development and redevelopment maintains the site consistent with the approved project plans. 
E.  When a stormwater BMP or management system is established under the control of a neighborhood association or other private entity, the developer shall develop and provide an operations and maintenance manual on the BMP to the entity as well as to the Town of Black Mountain Planning Department for future reference. 
F.  All development and redevelopment projects which cumulatively disturb more than 12,000 square feet or which are a part of a larger plan shall implement stormwater control measures that comply with the following standards: 
1.  Project sites must employ low impact development (LID) practices to analyze the infiltration capacity and natural drainages of the site and develop a system of controls which mimic the existing natural hydrology and which cumulatively capture and treat the runoff from the first inch of rainfall. LID practices may include any combination of site design techniques, strategies, and BMPs to store, infiltrate, evaporate, retain, and detain runoff on the site to more closely replicate pre-development runoff thereby limiting the increase in pollutant loads caused by development. 
2.  Wherever LID practices are not achievable, or have not been demonstrated, the measures controlling the final run-off from the site shall control and treat the difference in stormwater runoff volume leaving the project site between the pre- and post-development conditions for, at a minimum, the one-year, 24-hour storm as determined by NOAA data for Black Mountain ( http://dipper.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/orb/nc pfds.html ). Runoff volume drawdown time shall be a minimum of 48 hours, but not more than 120 hours. 
3.  All structural stormwater treatment systems used to meet the requirements of the program shall be designed to have a minimum of 85 percent average annual removal for total suspended solids. 
4.  Peak stormwater runoff rates shall be controlled for all development at or exceeding 24 percent built upon area or high density projects as defined by this ordinance, for both LID and conventional approaches. The peak stormwater runoff release rates leaving the site during post-construction conditions shall be equal to or less than the pre-development peak stormwater runoff release rates for the one-year frequency, 24-hour duration storm event as determined by NOAA data for Black Mountain. The emergency overflow and outlet works for any pond or wetland constructed as a stormwater BMP shall be capable of safely passing a discharge with a minimum recurrence frequency of 50 years. For detention basins, the temporary storage capacity shall be restored within 72 hours. Requirements of the Dam Safety Act shall be met when applicable. 
5.  No one BMP shall receive runoff from an area greater than three acres. However, the total drainage area from BMPs used in series (i.e., integrated) can exceed this three-acre maximum. 
6.  Encroachments. Water quality BMPs may encroach into a required buffer or yard setback as long as the encroachment does not disturb the majority of existing vegetation. Minor understory may be disturbed in order to accommodate water quality structures. Trees and shrubs shall be placed to maximize screening where the encroachment takes place. 
8.2.11 - Standards for stormwater control measures. 
A.  Evaluation according to contents of design manual. All stormwater control measures and stormwater treatment practices (also referred to as best management practices, or BMPs) required under this ordinance shall be evaluated by the stormwater administrator according to the policies, criteria, and information, including technical specifications and standards and the specific design criteria for each stormwater practice, in the design manual. The stormwater administrator shall determine whether they will be adequate to meet the requirements of this ordinance. 
B.  Determination of adequacy; presumptions and alternatives. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed, and constructed, and maintained in accordance with the criteria and specifications in the design manual will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality and quantity performance standards of this ordinance. Whenever an applicant proposes to utilize a practice or practices not designed and constructed in accordance with the criteria and specifications in the design manual, the applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that the practice(s) will satisfy the minimum water quality and quantity performance standards of this ordinance. The stormwater administrator may require the applicant to provide such documentation, calculations, and examples as necessary for the stormwater administrator to determine whether such an affirmative showing is made. 
8.2.12 - Dedication of BMPs, facilities and improvements. 
    The Town of Black Mountain may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this ordinance and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance. 
    This dedication may or may not be in conjunction with a conservation easement or within a common open space dedication as part of a subdivision, PUD or other development plan. Dedication of BMP and stormwater facility areas shall be identified on preliminary plats, PUD plans and other development proposals for consideration as part of approval processes. 
8.2.13 - Variances. 
A.  Any person may petition the town for a variance granting permission to use the person's land in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance. To qualify for a variance, the petitioner must follow the procedures outlined in section 1.7.3 [appendix A] of the Town of Black Mountain Code of Ordinances. 
B.  The town may impose reasonable and appropriate conditions upon any variance it grants. 
8.2.14 - Additional standards. 
A.  Trout waters. In addition to the standards for stormwater handling set out in the design manual, development and redevelopment that drains in whole or part to class TR waters shall design and implement the best stormwater practices that do not result in a sustained increase in the receiving water temperature, while still meeting the other requirements of this ordinance. 
8.2.15 - Onsite wastewater. 
A.  Operation and maintenance requirements. New and replaced onsite systems for domestic wastewater installed after the effective date of this ordinance must be approved and permitted by the Buncombe County Health Department. Both the Buncombe County septic permit and documentation showing the operation and maintenance for the system are required before a town building permit may be issued. 
B.  Standards for operation and maintenance. Onsite systems for domestic wastewater covered by this ordinance shall be operated and maintained so as to avoid adverse effects on surface water and groundwater, including eutrophication of surface water and microbial or nitrate contamination of groundwater. 
    Septic tank residuals shall be pumped whenever necessary to assure the proper operation of the system to meet these standards, and the septage shall be reused or disposed of in a manner that does not present significant risks to human health, surface water or groundwater. 
8.2.16 - General standards for maintenance. 
A.  Function of BMPs as intended. The owner of each structural BMP installed pursuant to this ordinance shall maintain and operate it so as to preserve and continue its function in controlling stormwater quality and quantity at the degree or amount of function for which the structural BMP was designed. 
B.  Annual maintenance inspection and report. The person responsible for maintenance of any structural BMP installed pursuant to this ordinance shall submit to the stormwater administrator an inspection report from a qualified registered North Carolina professional engineer, surveyor, or landscape architect performing services only in their area of competence. The inspection report shall contain all of the following: 
1.  The name and address of the land owner; 
2.  The recorded book and page number of the lot of each structural BMP; 
3.  A statement that an inspection was made of all structural BMPs; 
4.  The date the inspection was made; 
5.  A statement that all inspected structural BMPs are performing properly and are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the approved maintenance agreement required by this ordinance; and 
6.  The original signature and seal of the engineer, surveyor, or landscape architect. 
    All inspection reports shall be on forms supplied by the stormwater administrator. An original inspection report shall be provided to the stormwater administrator beginning one year from the date of as-built certification and each year thereafter on or before the date of the as-built certification. 
8.2.17 - Operation and maintenance agreement. 
A.  In general. 
1.  Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or building site to be served by a structural BMP pursuant to this ordinance, and prior to issuance of any permit for development or redevelopment requiring a structural BMP pursuant to this ordinance, the applicant or owner of the site must execute an operation and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of the site, portions of the site, and lots or parcels served by the structural BMP. Until the transference of all property, sites, or lots served by the structural BMP, the original owner or applicant shall have primary responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the maintenance agreement. 
2.  The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner or owners to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the structural BMP, and shall state the terms, conditions, and schedule of maintenance for the structural BMP. In addition, it shall grant to the town a right of entry in the event that the stormwater administrator has reason to believe it has become necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the structural BMP; however, in no case shall the right of entry, of itself, confer an obligation on the town to assume responsibility for the structural BMP. 
3.  The operation and maintenance agreement must be approved by the stormwater administrator prior to plan approval and shall be referenced on the final plat recorded with the county register of deeds upon final plat approval. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall be given to the stormwater administrator within 14 days following its recordation. 
B.  Special requirement for homeowners' and other associations. For all structural BMPs required pursuant to this ordinance and that are to be or are owned and maintained by a homeowners' association, property owners' association, or similar entity, the required operation and maintenance agreement shall include all of the following provisions: 
1.  Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously operate and maintain the stormwater control and management facilities. 
2.  Establishment of an escrow account, which can be spent solely for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, or reconstruction of the structural BMPs. If structural BMPs are not performing adequately or as intended or are not properly maintained, the town, in its sole discretion, may remedy the situation, and in such instances the town shall be fully reimbursed from the escrow account. Escrowed funds may be spent by the association for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, and reconstruction of the structural BMPs, provided that the planning director or his/her designated stormwater administrator shall first consent to the expenditure. 
3.  Both developer contribution and annual deposits for future use of "sinking funds" shall fund the escrow account. Prior to plat recordation or issuance of construction permits, whichever shall first occur, the developer shall pay into the escrow account an amount equal to 15 percent of the initial construction cost of the structural BMPs. Two-thirds of the total amount of sinking fund budget shall be deposited into the escrow account within the first five years and the full amount shall be deposited within ten years following initial construction of the structural BMPs. Funds shall be deposited each year into the escrow account to cover the cost of maintenance. A portion of the annual assessments of the association shall include an allocation into the escrow account. Any funds drawn down from the escrow account shall be replaced in accordance with the schedule of anticipated work used to create the sinking fund budget. 
4.  The percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to fund the escrow account may be varied by the town depending on the design and materials of the stormwater control and management facility. 
5.  Granting to the town a right of entry to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, and reconstruct structural BMPs. 
6.  Allowing the town to recover from the association and its members any and all costs the town expends to maintain or repair the structural BMPs or to correct any operational deficiencies. Failure to pay the town of its expended costs, after 45 days' written notice, shall constitute a breach of the agreement. The town shall thereafter be entitled to bring an action against the association and its members to pay, or foreclose upon the lien hereby authorized by the agreement against the property, or both, in case of a deficiency. Interest, collection costs, and attorney fees shall be added to the recovery. 
7.  A statement that this agreement shall not obligate the town to maintain or repair any structural BMPs, and that the town shall not be liable to any person for the condition or operation of structural BMPs. 
8.  A statement that this agreement shall not in any way diminish, limit, or restrict the right of the town to enforce any of its ordinances as authorized by law. 
9.  A provision indemnifying and holding harmless the town for any costs and injuries arising from or related to the structural BMP, unless the town has agreed in writing to assume the maintenance responsibility for the BMP and has accepted dedication of any and all rights necessary to carry out that maintenance. 
8.2.18 - Inspection program. 
    Inspections and inspection programs by the town may be conducted or established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to routine inspections, random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to, reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in BMPs; and evaluating the condition of BMPs. 
    If the owner or occupant of any property refuses to permit such inspection, the stormwater administrator shall proceed to obtain an administrative search warrant pursuant to G.S. 15-27.2 or its successor. No person shall obstruct, hamper or interfere with the stormwater administrator while carrying out his or her official duties. 
8.2.19 - Performance security for installation and maintenance. 
A.  The town may, at its discretion, require the submittal of a performance security or bond with surety, cash escrow, letter of credit or other acceptable legal arrangement prior to issuance of a permit in order to ensure that the structural BMPs are (1) installed by the permit holder as required by the approved stormwater management plan, and/or (2) maintained by the owner as required by the operation and maintenance agreement. This requirement may be instituted in addition to and in conjunction with other performance security of bond requirements the town may require in conjunction with a subdivision or development plan. 
B.  The amount of an installation performance security shall be the total estimated construction cost of the BMPs approved under the permit, plus 25 percent. 
C.  The amount of a maintenance performance security shall determined based on the type of BMP and a projected annual maintenance cost as recorded in the maintenance agreement. 
D.  Uses of performance security. 
1.  Forfeiture provisions. The performance security shall contain forfeiture provisions for failure, after proper notice, to complete work within the time specified, or to initiate or maintain any actions which may be required of the applicant or owner in accordance with this ordinance, approvals issued pursuant to this ordinance, or an operation and maintenance agreement established pursuant to this ordinance. 
2.  Default. Upon default of the owner to construct, maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct any structural BMP in accordance with the applicable permit or operation and maintenance agreement, the stormwater administrator shall obtain and use all or any portion of the security to make necessary improvements based on an engineering estimate. Such expenditure of funds shall be made after requesting the owner to comply with the permit or maintenance agreement. In the event of a default triggering the use of installation performance security, the town shall not return any of the unused deposited cash funds or other security which shall be retained for maintenance. 
3.  Costs in excess of performance security. If town takes action upon such failure by the applicant or owner, it may collect from the applicant or owner for the difference, should the amount of the reasonable cost of such action exceed the amount of the security held. 
4.  Refund. Within 60 days of the final approval, the installation performance security shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated, with the exception of any amount attributable to the cost (plus 25 percent) of landscaping installation and ongoing maintenance associated with the BMPs covered by the security. Any such landscaping shall be inspected one year after installation with replacement for compliance with the approved plans and specifications and, if in compliance, the portion of the financial security attributable to landscaping shall be released. 
8.2.20 - Notice to owners. 
A.  Deed recordation and indications on plat. The applicable operations and maintenance agreement, including but not limited to conservation easement, or dedication and acceptance into public maintenance, pertaining to every structural BMP shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with the county register of deeds upon final plat approval. If no subdivision plat is recorded for the site, then the operations and maintenance agreement, or conservation easement, or dedication and acceptance into public maintenance, {whichever is applicable] shall be recorded with the county register of deeds so as to appear in the chain of title of all subsequent purchasers under generally accepted searching principles. 
B.  Signage. For homeowner's and other associations, and where else deemed appropriate for the compliance of this ordinance, the stormwater administrator may require a structural BMPs to be posted with a conspicuous sign stating who is responsible for required maintenance and annual inspection. The sign shall be maintained so as to remain visible and legible. 
8.2.21 - Records of installation and maintenance activities. 
    The owner of each structural BMP shall keep records of inspections, maintenance, and repairs for at least five years from the date of creation of the record and shall submit the same upon reasonable request to the stormwater administrator. 
    Every structural BMP installed pursuant to this ordinance shall be made accessible for adequate maintenance and repair in accordance with the maintenance agreement, including, but not limited to a maintenance easement. If a maintenance easement is provided then it shall be recorded and its terms shall specify who may make use of the easement and for what purposes. 
8.2.22 - Illicit municipal discharges and connections. 
    The Federal Phase II rule specifies that local communities shall prohibit any discharge to a municipal separate storm unless it: 
A.  Consists of a discharge pursuant to an NPDES permit; or 
B.  Consists of a discharge from fire fighting activities; or 
C.  Consists of a discharge in any of the following categories, and the operator of the small MS4 has not identified that category as a significant contributor of pollutants to its small MS4:

SECTION 8.3 - LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS 

8.3.1 - Purpose and applicability. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to improve the appearance, quality and quantity of landscaping as part of new development and to regulate the protection, installation, and long-term management of trees and shrubs and to minimize potential nuisances, such as visual impacts, noise, dust, odor, litter, and glare of lights, from adjacent properties. The appropriate use of existing and supplemental landscaping enhances the appearance of the built environment and blends new development with our natural, mountain landscape. Existing vegetation should be retained where possible to ensure cohesive landscaping. This chapter is also provided in order to: 
1.  Provide visual buffering and to enhance the beautification of the town; 
2.  Safeguard and enhance property values and to protect public and private investment; 
3.  Preserve, protect and restore the unique identity and environment of the Town of Black Mountain and to preserve the economic base for tourism and visitors to the town; 
4.  Encourage the preservation of existing trees and vegetation; 
5.  Aid in stabilizing the environment by contributing to the process of air purification, ground water recharge, and stormwater runoff retardation, while at the same time aiding in noise, glare, and heat reduction; 
6.  Conserve energy; and 
7.  Protect the public health, safety and general welfare of the town. 
B.  All new developments (except for infill single-family detached residential uses and duplexes) shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. A change of use or expansion of an existing building or parking area also requires compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Where necessary to accommodate creativity in site design, or where conformance with the strict requirements of this chapter are not feasible, the town zoning board of adjustment may modify these requirements through a variance procedure or as part of a conditional use or special use permit request, provided that the type and amount of landscaping or other features are equivalent in effectiveness. 
C.  The landscape plan required by this chapter shall accompany any request for a building permit or plat approval by the Town of Black Mountain for commercial or multi-family and major subdivision development. No building permit shall be issued, nor plat approved until the landscape plan is approved by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator may request any additional information needed to determine compliance with this subchapter. 
D.  Landscaping requirements may be met as part of an approved stormwater administrator plan and as incorporated into stormwater management practices such as planted swales or rain gardens. 
8.3.2 - General provisions.

M.  Application forms for sign permits shall be obtained from the office of the zoning administrator. Completed forms must include a drawing of the sign, including dimensions and location of the sign showing set backs, and shall be filed with the zoning administrator. Sign permits will be issued based on the information provided on the application.

SECTION 9.7 - VARIANCES 

9.7.1 - Variances. 
A.  In accordance with the procedures stated in article 4 of the land use code, the board of adjustment shall have the power to hear and act upon applications for a variance from these requirements if: 
1.  Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate, that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property; 
2.  The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance; 
3.  The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship; 
4.  The variance will neither result in the extension of a nonconforming use nor authorize the initiation of a nonconforming use; and 
5.  The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved. 
B.  In granting a variance, the board of adjustment shall make written findings that all of the requirements listed in section 1.7.3 [appendix A] have been met. If a variance is granted, it shall be the least possible deviation from the requirements of this subchapter. In granting any variance, the board of adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this subchapter. Violations of the provisions of the variance granted, including any conditions or safeguards, which are a part of the grant of the variance, shall be deemed a violation of this subchapter.

A.  Areas suitable for parking automobiles in off-street locations shall be required in all zoning districts, except in the central business district (CB), at the time of initial construction of any principal building producing an increase in dwelling units, guest rooms, floor area, seating or bed capacity, or when a conversion in use occurs. 
B.  The off-street parking areas shall have direct vehicular access to a street and shall be provided and maintained in accordance with the requirements set forth herein. 
C.  Parking lots shall generally be located at the rear or at the side of buildings to the extent practicable and shall be screened from public rights-of-way and sidewalks by land forms, landscaping, fencing or evergreen vegetation so as to provide a barrier that will be at least three feet wide. Parking lots abutting residential zoning districts must be screened by an opaque fence or vegetative buffer of at least ten feet in width and a minimum of six feet in height of sufficient density to act as a screen as determined by the zoning administrator. (Ord., passed 12-13-82; Am. Ord., passed 7-11-83; Am. Ord. O-99-07, passed 5-10-99) 
SECTION 10.2 - PARKING SPACE AREA 

10.2.1 - Parking space area.

D.  One-way entrances or aisles where parking is only provided on one side of the aisle shall be no less than 14 feet wide. 
E.  In all districts except for the central business district and the industrial districts, two-way entrances should be no greater than 24 feet wide, or 30 feet wide if used by trucks with more than two axels, in order to calm the speed of entering traffic and protect pedestrian safety. One-way entrances should be no less than 12 feet and no greater than 14 feet for one-way traffic.

( Ord. No. O-17-03 , § 4, 4-10-2017) 
SECTION 10.3 - PARKING SURFACES 

10.3.1 - Parking surfaces. 
A.  All vehicular parking areas in commercial and industrial districts and parking areas of more than four spaces in all other districts shall be constructed of a durable and dustless surface. This section shall not apply to parking areas at private dwellings in single and duplex dwelling structures or to areas where the use is strictly for display or parking of vehicles for sale. 
B.  The durable, dustless surface may be temporarily omitted upon approval of the planning board wherever it can be demonstrated by the property owner or developer that the permanent size, shape, or location of the parking area cannot be determined until the permanent development of the property is accomplished. In those instances where a non-durable, non-dustless surface is approved, the surface shall at all times be maintained in good condition and free from ruts, potholes and vegetation. Failure to properly maintain the area may be cause for the board of aldermen to require the owner to construct a durable, dustless surface. Board of aldermen approval of such a temporary lot will be subject to annual review and only in cases of hardship will the lot be allowed to remain for more than one year. 
C.  For the purposes of this section, a durable, dustless surface shall be one constructed of concrete, asphalt, macadam, brick or similar material; or special paving brick or block of such design as to permit the passage of water freely through the brick or block within the voids thereof. Loose stone or compacted stone without a suitable bonding agent shall not be accepted as a durable, dustless surface. The zoning administrator will consider the terrain, the configuration of the lot and the anticipated amount of vehicle activity in making this permitting decision. 
D.  Use of permeable pavements or other surface technologies are welcome as long as they are maintained in good condition and function, and documentation is provided as to the maintenance program for the parking lot. Use of permeable surfaces may result in a reduction of stormwater BMPs as required by the land use code and at the discretion of the planning director or stormwater administrator. 
SECTION 10.4 - LOCATION ON OTHER PROPERTY AND SHARED PARKING 

10.4.1 - Location on other property and shared parking. 
A.  If the required automobile parking space cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot with the principal use, the spaces may be provided on other off-street property under the same ownership or on other property rented or leased, provided such property lies within 300 feet walking distance of the main entrance to the principal use. The automobile parking spaces shall be associated with the principal use and shall not be reduced or encroached upon in any manner which would reduce the number of parking spaces below the required minimum. 
B.  Shared parking. 
1.  The zoning administrator may approve the joint use of up to 100 percent of the required parking spaces for two or more uses located on the same parcel or adjacent parcels, provided that the developer can demonstrate that the uses will not overlap in hours of operation or in demand for the shared spaces. 
2.  Any sharing of required parking spaces uses located on different parcels shall be guaranteed by a written agreement between the owner of the parking area and the owner of any use located on a different parcel and served by the parking area. 
3.  The owner of said lot relinquished his development rights over the property until such time as parking space is provided elsewhere or the shared parking agreement expires or is amended. 
4.  Should the uses change such that the new uses overlap in hours of operation or in demand for the shared spaces, the shared parking approval shall be amended accordingly or shall become void. Parking meeting the requirements of this chapter shall then be provided for each use. 
SECTION 10.5 - USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY FOR MANEUVERING 

10.5.1 - Use of public rights-of-way for maneuvering. 
    When determining parking area requirements for individual uses, portions of the public rights-of-way for streets may not be considered as permissible for maneuvering incidental to parking. Direct access to individual parking spaces from public rights-of-way shall not be allowed. 
SECTION 10.6 - CURB CUTS AND ACCESS POINTS 

10.6.1 - Curb cuts and access points. 
A.  All site plans shall be reviewed for "access management." Access management is the implementation of design intended to address organized and controlled traffic movement to minimize traffic conflict, provide efficient traffic flow, and to provide a more pedestrian-friendly development pattern. Access management should address the location and design of public street and driveway connections to the primary roadway, as well as promote site design that minimizes the total number of connections needed throughout the corridor. 
B.  Ingress-egress openings in concrete, asphalt, rock or other curbing provisions, commonly referred to as curb cuts, as well as other vehicular means of access to and from private property, shall apply in all zoning districts established by this chapter in accordance with the town driveway requirements and the approval of the N.C. Department of Transportation when involving a state road. 
C.  Wherever feasible, access points to town or state roads shall be designed to provide shared access to parking lots by abutting properties, and shall be designed to channel traffic onto side streets, preferably those with traffic signalization, thereby reducing the number of curb cuts. 
D.  In no case shall a curb cut or other access point be less than ten feet nor more than 30 feet in width. No more than two curb cuts per lot shall be permitted except in commercial or industrial districts where two shall be permitted on each street upon which the lot fronts or as allowed as part of a special use permit.

CHAPTER 12. - INCLUSIONARY HOUSING BONUS 
SECTION 12.1 - PURPOSE AND APPLICATION 

12.1.1 - Purpose and application. 
A.  The purpose and intent of the inclusionary housing bonus regulations are as follows: 
1.  To implement the goals of the 2004 Comprehensive Plan to maintain a variety of housing options for people of low and moderate incomes and provide a range of housing opportunities for those who work in Black Mountain and provide the community with essential services; and 
2.  To ensure affordable housing opportunities are available throughout the entire community; and 
3.  To mitigate the impacts of market-rate housing on the supply and cost of housing, due to the decreasing available supply of developable sites in the Town of Black Mountain and the upward pressure on the pricing of all housing in Buncombe County; 
4.  To promote higher density and affordability along major highways and transit routes; and 
5.  To provide incentives to developers to include affordable units within new development; and 
6.  To provide an alternative method for compliance with the intent of this ordinance, through a payment in lieu to a housing trust fund. 
B.  These guidelines establish a density-bonus for development that includes housing sold at price points affordable to citizens of average median income (AMI) or less as established for Buncombe County and applied to the following districts only: 
1.  Conservation residential district (CR-1) 2 units/acre allowed with 50 percent inclusion 
(minimum of 1 AMI unit included for any density above 1/acre, but not to exceed 2/acre). 
2.  Suburban residential district (SR-2) 4 units/acre allowed with 25 percent inclusion 
(minimum of 1 AMI unit included for any density above 2/acre, but not to exceed 4/acre). 
3.  Town residential district (TR-4)  6 units/acre allowed with 16 percent inclusion 
(minimum of 1 AMI unit included for any density above 4/acre, not to exceed 6/acre). 
4.  Urban residential district (UR-8) 10 units/acre with 10 percent inclusion 
(minimum of 1 AMI unit included for any density above 8/acre, not to exceed 10/acre). 
5.  Office institutional district (OI-6) 10 units/acre with 10 percent inclusion 
(minimum of 1 AMI unit included for any density above 8/acre, not to exceed 10/acre). 
6.  Neighborhood mixed use district (NMU-8) 10 units/acre with 10% inclusion 
(minimum of 1 AMI unit included for any density above 8/acre, not to exceed 10/acre). 
7.  Highway business (HB-8) 10 units/acre with 10 percent inclusion; 16 units/acre with 25% 
(minimum of 1 AMI unit included for any density above 8/acre, not to exceed 10/acre; or a minimum of 1 AMI unit included for every 4 units at a density of 16 units/acre). 
C.  For the purposes of this chapter, affordable units are defined as housing for which monthly mortgage payments (including taxes and insurance), do not exceed 30 percent of that amount which represents the percentage of the median adjusted gross annual income for the households qualifying under the definitions of very-low, low, and moderate income persons, as provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development data. Thresholds for the maximum price of units considered affordable under this definition are based on the Asheville Urban Area and are provided in the appendix. These may be updated periodically based on information from HUD. 
D.  Rental properties are not included in the inclusionary density bonus unless the project is already receiving some other federal, state, or local assistance (e.g., Low Income Housing Tax Credits, HUD Section 202, Consortium HOME financing). 
E.  Unless specifically exempted below, any development involving multiple units may apply for the inclusionary density bonus in accordance with the underlying zoning regulations, specifically: 
1.  Major subdivision;. 
2.  Multi-family residential buildings; 
3.  Special use permits. 
F.  The following are specifically exempted from the inclusionary density bonus: 
1.  Community living facilities; 
2.  School dormitories; and 
3.  Manufactured home parks. 
G.  For the purposes of this chapter, two or more developments shall be aggregated and considered as one development, only if they are no more than one-fourth-mile apart and any two of the following criteria are met: 
1.  There is a common interest in two or more developments. 
2.  The developments will undergo improvements within the same five-year period. 
3.  A master plan is submitted and approved by the planning board regarding the comprehensive development of designated properties. 
H.  Qualifying developments for the inclusionary density bonus provide a ten-percent set aside for residential units to be sold at affordable price points based on average median income up to ten units per acre (or one unit for every ten units developed). So for example, if the maximum density for the district is 8 units per acre, the SUP plan may include ten units per acre if one of the units is sold at AMI thresholds provided in the appendix. 
I.  If a developer provides 25 percent of their units at an affordable price point (one unit for every four), then they can have an additional density bonus up to 16 units per acre, according to the zoning district in which they are located. (See chapter 12). 
SECTION 12.2 - ADMINISTRATION AND PROCEDURES 

12.2.1 - Administration and procedures. 
A.  The inclusionary density bonus for affordable housing shall be administered by the planning and development department with guidance from the housing commission. 
B.  At the time of application, a developer must indicate their intention to ask for the density bonus. Density bonus calculations shall be included in the sketch plan, preliminary plat and master plan provided as part of the technical review with staff and the approval process with the zoning board of adjustment and the planning board where applicable. 
C.  All affordable housing units shall remain affordable for a period of five years though the use of a deed restriction that shall be recorded in the public records of Buncombe County. 
D.  All affordable housing units shall be initially and subsequently certified as to unit and income household eligibility of the buyer by the planning and development department, based on the current income guidelines through the Asheville Regional HOME Consortium and shall be monitored for the duration of the five-year period. Units have to be sold to buyers with less than 100 percent AMI (adjusted for family size). 
E.  Fee waivers for affordability and green building may still be applied in accordance with chapter 2.1. 
F.  Although it is intended that affordable units be included on-site, the zoning board of adjustment may allow the requirements of this ordinance to be met through the payment of a fee in lieu of construction for development with 16 or less residential units, as follows: 
1.  The fee in lieu of construction shall be equivalent to 50 percent of the average proposed selling price of units within the development at the time of construction. This threshold may be adjusted by action of the board of aldermen as part of a text amendment procedure and at the positive recommendation of the housing commission. 
2.  The fee shall be paid into a fund which shall be established and maintained by the board of aldermen who may designate a fund manager or board. The fund shall be established for the purpose of assisting with the development of affordable housing within Black Mountain. Applications of this fund may include grants or loans to developers for the purposes of land acquisition, engineering, construction or other costs associated with development of new and affordable housing as approved by a designated committee appointed by the board of aldermen. 
3.  The donation of developable land in an area that would provide housing choice may be used to meet the fee-in-lieu option as long as the market value of the property meets the amount required in F.1. above. 
K.  The housing trust fund shall be established by action of the board of aldermen at the time funds are available to initiate the trust fund. 
SECTION 12.3 - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

12.3.1 - General provisions. 
A.  Developments shall not be segmented or phased in a manner to avoid compliance with these provisions. 
B.  Affordable units shall be of similar construction and architecture of the other units in the development and shall not otherwise be visually distinct from the other units in the development. For example, a duplex of similar architectural style and yard setbacks may be incorporated into a single-family subdivision as long as the structure blends with the other structures of the subdivision and all other regulations of the district are met. 
C.  The inclusionary density bonus may be applied to conservation subdivisions. However, where an inclusionary density bonus is sought as part of a development within a steep slope lot as determined in chapter 8.1, the steep slope maximum densities shall prevail. 
D.  Aside from the density bonus allowed per district, all other requirements for the zoning district in which the development is located as well as all general zoning provisions for the town and other town requirements shall apply.
