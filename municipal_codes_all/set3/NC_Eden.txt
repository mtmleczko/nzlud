embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may:
(1) Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
(2) Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of
the code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles;
(3) Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the code
and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision
numbers;
(4) Change the words “this ordinance” or words of the same meaning to “this chapter,” “this
article,” “this division,” etc., as the case may be, or to “sections _________ through,” inserting section
10 Eden - General Provisions
numbers to indicate the sections of the code which embody the substantive sections of the
ordinance incorporated into the code; and
(5) Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of
ordinance sections inserted into the code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the
meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the
code.

laws and rules governing civil proceedings including G.S. §160A-175(e) and the Rules of Civil
Procedure.
(C) It shall not be a defense to an application by the city for equitable relief that it may have
an adequate remedy at law.
(Ord. passed 6-20-96)
24 Eden - General Provisions
§ 1-16.1 GENERAL PENALTY FOR VIOLATIONS OF ORDINANCES, PENALTIES
NONEXCLUSIVE.
(A) Unless otherwise provided by the terms of an ordinance, a violation of such ordinance is
a misdemeanor or infraction as provided by G.S. § 14-4 unless the City Council has expressly
stated that the maximum fine, term of imprisonment, or infraction penalty to be imposed for a
violation of a particular ordinance is some amount of money or number of days less than the
maximum penalties imposed by G.S. § 14-4.
(B) This section shall not be deemed to be the exclusive penalty for violation of a city
ordinance nor shall it in any way be deemed to limit any legal or equitable remedy or power the
city may be empowered to use to enforce its ordinances.
(C) Each act that violates this ordinance and each day upon which a violation of this
ordinance shall occur shall constitute a separate offense except as may be otherwise specifically
provided.
(Ord. passed 6-20-96)
§ 1-16.2 ENFORCEMENT OF ORDINANCES BY CIVIL PENALTIES,
NONEXCLUSIVE.
(A) In addition to the general penalty provided for in § 1-16.1 of the City Code, an
ordinance may provide that a violation of the ordinance shall subject the offender to a civil
penalty.
(B) In the event an ordinance provides that a violation thereof shall subject the offender to a
civil penalty, the civil penalty shall be recovered by the city in a civil action in the nature of a
debt if the offender does not pay the penalty within 15 days after the offender has been served
with a citation for a violation of the ordinance.
(C) Upon determination of a violation of any section of this code, the penalty for which is a
civil penalty, the appropriate official of the city shall report such violation to the City Manager
and request approval to proceed with the civil citation procedure. Approval of the request to
proceed by the City Manager shall empower the appropriate city official to proceed to issue a
warning citation and, if necessary, a penalty citation. The warning citation and the citation shall
set out the nature of the violation, the section violated, the date of the violation, and shall contain
an order to immediately cease the violation. If the violation is one for which an order of
abatement would be appropriate in a civil proceeding, a reasonable period of time must be stated
in which the violation must be abated. The warning citation shall be served by delivering a copy
to the violator or by mailing a copy to the violator by first class mail by depositing it enclosed in
a postpaid, properly addressed wrapper in a post office or official depository under the exclusive
care and custody of the United States Postal Service.
General Provisions 25
(D) Where the official determines that the period of time stated in the original warning
citation is not sufficient for abatement based upon the work required or based upon a schedule
agreed upon with the violator for abatement, the official may amend the warning citation to
provide for additional time. The warning citation shall specify that a second citation shall incur a
civil penalty, together with costs, and attorney fees.
(E) Upon failure of the violator to obey the warning citation, a civil citation shall be issued
by the official and either served personally on the violator, or the violator's duly designated
agent, or registered agent if a corporation, or by depositing a copy in the post office for mailing
by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the violator at the violator's
dwelling house or usual place of abode. The citation shall direct the violator to pay the citation
to the Finance Department within 15 days of the date of service of the citation. The violation for
which the citation is issued must have been corrected by the time the citation is paid, otherwise
further citations shall be issued.
(F) Appeals from a citation for a violation of the zoning ordinance shall be made to the
Board of Adjustment and the violator must file written notice of such appeal with the Board of
Adjustment within ten days from the date of the service of the citation. Except in any case where
the ordinance which is violated specifically grants to the Board of Adjustment other powers in
considering appeals and such appeal is applied for, the Board of Adjustment in considering
appeals of a citation shall have power only in the manner of administrative review and
interpretation where it is alleged that the official has made an error in the application of this
code, in the factual situation as it relates to the application of the code, or both.
(G) Except for appeals from citations for violations of the zoning ordinance, appeals shall
be made to the City Manager and the violator must file written notice of such appeal with the
City Manager within ten days from the date of the service of the citation.
(H) Unless the terms of an ordinance exempt it from the operation of this section, each day
upon which a violation of the ordinance shall continue or occur shall constitute a separate and
distinct offense.

10 Eden – Administration
§ 2-58 NOMINATION AND APPOINTMENT POLICY.
The intent of this nomination and appointment policy is not to restrict or limit the appointment of
qualified people to the various boards and commissions that comprise the city planning organization.
Rather, the intent is to aid the City Council in the location, selection and appointment of qualified
people and to provide a structure in which each Council member and the Mayor has the opportunity to
make a nomination to each board and commission. It is only for this purpose that this policy is drafted.
(A) Each member of the City Council shall have the opportunity to make one nomination to each
board and commission that comprises the planning organization in accordance with the membership
requirements of the applicable board or commission. (i.e., Planning Board, Board of Adjustment,
Historic Preservation Commission, Community Appearance Commission and Tree Board).
(B) The Mayor shall have the opportunity to make one nomination to each board and commission
that comprises the planning organization in accordance with the membership requirements of the
applicable board or commission.
(C) With the exception of the Planning Board and the Board of Adjustment, nominations are not
limited to the ward of the nominator and a City Council member and the Mayor may nominate a person
that resides in the planning and zoning jurisdiction of the city.
(D) As required by ordinance, the Planning Board shall be composed of one member from each
ward and one member chosen at large from the planning and zoning jurisdiction. Each City Council
member shall have the opportunity to nominate one person from his or her ward to the Planning Board
and the Mayor shall have the opportunity to nominate one person from the planning and zoning
jurisdiction.
(E) As required by the zoning ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall be composed of seven
members chosen at large from the city and one member chosen at large from the planning and zoning
jurisdiction. Each City Council member shall have the opportunity to nominate one person from the
city and the Mayor shall have the opportunity to nominate one person from the planning and zoning
jurisdiction.
(F) The City Council shall nominate two members to the Planning Board and two members to the
Board of Adjustment from the extraterritorial jurisdiction. Extraterritorial jurisdiction members shall be
appointed by the County Commissioners in accordance with applicable ordinance requirements and
state law.
(G) All appointments to the boards and commissions, except those appointed by the County
Commissioners, shall be approved by the City Council as required by ordinance.
(H) Beginning in 1992, the staff will supply attendance and performance reports of all boards and
commissions in September of each year.
(I) A public awareness program shall be instituted making the public more aware of the board's
and commission's duties and responsibilities and of the opportunity for appointment to the various
boards and commissions. An application process shall be part of the program and shall serve as a
source of information for possible future appointments. The application process shall in no way limit
or restrict the nomination and appointment process.
Planning Organization 11
(J) Guidelines outlining the qualities needed in an appointee for a particular board or commission
shall be prepared by staff and made available to the City Council and the Mayor.
(K) An effort shall be made to appoint persons to the boards and commissions such that the
makeup of each board and commission will more closely reflect the demographics of the city and the
needs and interests of that particular board or commission. (See guidelines as referenced above).
(Ord. passed 3-17-92)
DIVISION 2 CITY COUNCIL
§ 2-61 GENERAL POWERS AND DUTIES.
The City Council, as the governing body of the city, acts in its legislative capacity when it adopts
ordinances and amendments; appropriates funds; approves acquisition, construction, and disposition of
public facilities; and oversees administration of the city. In its quasi-judicial or administrative capacity
it issues special-use permits under the zoning ordinance.
(Ord. passed 3-17-92)
Statutory reference:
Municipal authority, see G.S. § 160A-381
DIVISION 3 PLANNING BOARD
§ 2-66 CREATED.
The City of Eden Planning Board is hereby created pursuant to G.S. Chapter 160A-361 and the
provisions of this article.
(Ord. passed 3-17-92)
§ 2-67 MEMBERSHIP AND VACANCIES.
(A) The Planning Board shall consist of ten members. Seven members shall be citizens and
residents of the city and shall be appointed by the City Council which shall appoint one member from
each ward. Two members shall be citizens and residents of the extraterritorial area described in an
ordinance adopted November 21, 1978, pursuant to G.S. § 160A-362, and shall be appointed by the
County Board of Commissioners in accordance with G.S. § 160A-362. One member shall be
nominated by the Mayor and shall be appointed at large from the planning and zoning jurisdiction of
the city by the City Council. If despite good faith efforts, residents of the extraterritorial area cannot be
found to fill the seats reserved for extraterritorial residents, then the County Board of Commissioners
may appoint other residents of the county (including residents of the City of Eden) to fill these seats. If
the County Board of Commissioners fails to make these appointments within 90 days after receiving a
resolution from the City Council requesting that they be made, then the City Council may make the
appointments. Extraterritorial members shall have equal rights, privileges, and duties with the other
members of the Board and may vote on all matters coming before the Board.
12 Eden - Administration
(B) The members shall be appointed for terms of three years, with the exception of the initial ten
members. Four of the initial members shall be appointed for a term of one year; three for two years;
and three for three years. Vacancies occurring for reasons other than expiration of terms shall be filled
as they occur for the period of the unexpired term. If a city member moves outside the city, or if an
extraterritorial member moves outside the planning and zoning jurisdiction, that shall constitute a
resignation from the Board effective upon the date a replacement is appointed.
(Ord. passed 3-17-92)
§ 2-68 ABSENCE AND ATTENDANCE.
It shall be the duty of all Planning Board members to inform the administrative assistant of the
Board of any anticipated absence and notification shall be immediately after receipt of the agenda. A
member who misses three consecutive meetings or more than 30% of the meetings in a calendar year
loses his status as a member of the Board until reappointed or replaced by the governing body of his
respective unit. Absences due to sickness, death or other emergencies of like nature shall be regarded
as proved absences and shall not affect the member's status on the Board; except, that in the event of a
long illness or other such case for prolonged absence the member may be replaced.
(Ord. passed 3-17-92; Am. Ord. passed 5-17-94)
§ 2-69 RULES OF CONDUCT FOR MEMBERS.
Members of the Planning Board may be removed for cause by the City Council, including
violation of the rules stated below.
(A) Faithful attendance at all Board meetings and conscientious performance of the duties
required of Board members shall be considered a prerequisite of continuing membership on the Board.
(B) Each member of the Board shall be familiar with all statutes, laws, ordinances and rules of
procedure relating to the Board as time and circumstances permit.
(C) It shall be the duty of every Board member to avoid even the appearance of conflict of
interest. Therefore, no member shall vote on, discuss, debate, advocate, influence, or otherwise
participate before the Board in any matter that would substantially affect, directly or indirectly, his or
her personal financial interests or the financial interests of a member of his household. This prohibition
includes formal or informal consideration of the matter by the Board, whether conducted in public or
private. This provision does not prohibit participation in advisory decisions that will have a similar
effect on all citizens of the planning area or in which the financial interest is so insignificant or remote
that it is unlikely to affect the member's official action in any way. In applying this rule the following
procedure shall govern:
(1) A member who has a conflict of interest shall disqualify himself and withdraw from
participation in the matter. The member shall not sit with the Board during the consideration and
discussion of that matter.
Planning Organization 13
(2) Withdrawal from participation in any matter is necessary only in those specific cases in
which a conflict arises. There shall be no attempt to exclude entire categories of consideration because
of the business or profession with which a member is associated.
(3) Any Board member may seek an opinion from the City Attorney as to the applicability of
this section to a particular decision or set of facts. The response to such a request shall be made to the
member making the request, and a copy shall be provided to the chairman of the Board. By majority
vote, the Board may seek the opinion of the City Attorney as to the applicability of this section to a
particular decision or set of facts.
(4) If an opinion is received from the City Attorney that a member has an impermissible
conflict of interest pursuant to a particular decision or set of facts and the member does not disqualify
himself or herself, the Board may by majority vote (not considering the vote of the member with the
alleged conflict) disqualify that member from all participation in the matter involved.
(D) Members of the Board shall not commit themselves on any question scheduled to be
considered by the Board prior to the consideration of the matter at a duly authorized meeting. Members
shall use discretion in discussing with individuals scheduled agenda items which are later to be voted
on by the Board.
(Ord. passed 3-17-92)
§ 2-70 ORGANIZATION, RULES, MEETINGS AND RECORDS.
The Planning Board shall elect a chair and create and fill such offices as it may determine. The
term of the chair and other officers shall be one year, with eligibility for reelection. The Director of the
Planning and Inspections Department or his designated appointee shall act as the administrative
assistant to the Board, and subject to the direction of the chair, shall be responsible for taking minutes
of all meetings, conducting all correspondence of the Board, supervising all clerical work of the Board,
maintaining a file of all studies, plans, reports, recommendations and actions of the Board, as well as,
providing other technical and professional assistance to the Board. The administrative assistant shall
not be eligible to vote on any matter. The Board shall adopt rules for transaction of its business and
shall keep a record of its members' attendance and of its resolutions, discussions, findings and
recommendations, which shall be a public record. The Planning Board shall establish a regular
meeting schedule and shall meet frequently enough so that it can take action in conformity with its

fields. The members shall be appointed for a term of three years with the exception of the eight initial
members. Two of the initial members shall be appointed for a term of one year; three for two years;
and three for three years. Vacancies occurring for reasons other than expiration of terms shall be filled

(Ord. passed 3-17-92; Am. Ord. passed 6-19-01)
§ 2-93 ABSENCE AND ATTENDANCE.
It shall be the duty of all Historic Preservation Commission members to inform the administrative
assistant of the Commission of any anticipated absence and notification shall be immediately after
receipt of the agenda. A member who misses three consecutive meetings or more than 30% of the

§ 2-94 RULES OF CONDUCT FOR MEMBERS.
Members of the Historic Preservation Commission may be removed for cause by the City Council,
including violation of the rules stated below.
(A) Faithful attendance at all Commission meetings and conscientious performance of the duties
required of Commission members shall be considered a prerequisite of continuing membership on the
Commission.
(B) Each member of the Commission shall be familiar with all statutes, laws, ordinances and rules
of procedure relating to the Commission as time and circumstances permit.
(C) It shall be the duty of every Commission member to avoid even the appearance of conflict of
interest. Therefore, no member shall vote on, discuss, debate, advocate, influence, or otherwise
participate before the Commission in any matter that would substantially affect, directly or indirectly,
his or her personal financial interests or the financial interests of a member of his household. This
prohibition includes formal or informal consideration of the matter by the Commission, whether
conducted in public or private. This provision does not prohibit participation in advisory decisions that
will have a similar effect on all citizens of the planning area or in which the financial interest is so
insignificant or remote that it is unlikely to affect the member's official action in any way. Furthermore,
members of the Commission shall disqualify themselves from participation in quasi-judicial decisions
in which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Therefore, members shall refrain from all
participation in any matter in which they have a personal bias or prejudice, or a personal or financial
relationship with any of the parties or the parties' representatives. In applying this rule the following
procedure shall govern:
(1) A member who has a conflict of interest shall disqualify himself and withdraw from
participation in the matter. The member shall not sit with the Commission during the consideration and
discussion of that matter.
(2) Withdrawal from participation in any matter is necessary only in those specific cases in
which a conflict arises. There shall be no attempt to exclude entire categories of consideration because
of the business or profession with which a member is associated.
(3) Any Commission member may seek an opinion from the City Attorney as to the
applicability of this section to a particular decision or set of facts. The response to such a request shall
be made to the member making the request, and a copy shall be provided to the chairman of the
Commission. By majority vote, the Commission may seek the opinion of the City Attorney as to the
applicability of this section to a particular decision or set of facts.
20 Eden - Administration
(4) If an opinion is received from the City Attorney that a member has an impermissible
conflict of interest pursuant to a particular decision or set of facts and the member does not disqualify
himself or herself, the Commission may by majority vote (not considering the vote of the member with
the alleged conflict) disqualify that member from all participation in the matter involved.
(D) No Commission member shall vote on any matter that decides an application unless he has
attended the hearing on that application.
(E) Members of the Commission shall not commit themselves on any question scheduled to be
considered by the Commission prior to the consideration of the matter at a duly authorized meeting.
Members shall use discretion in discussing with individuals scheduled agenda items which are later to
be voted on by the Commission.
(F) Members of the Commission shall not express individual opinions on the proper judgement of
any application with any parties thereto before that case is determined. Violation of this rule shall be
cause for dismissal from the Commission.

§ 2-100 DESIGNATION OF HISTORIC DISTRICTS.
(A) A historic district is hereby established as a district which overlaps with other zoning districts,
the extent and boundaries of which are indicated on the zoning map for the city and its environs. The
historic district now contains, and may in the future contain several different residential, commercial
and industrial zoning classifications, and all uses permitted in any such district, whether by right or as a
special use, shall be permitted in the historic district.
(B) No historic district or districts shall be designated until:
(1) The Historic Preservation Commission shall have prepared and adopted rules of
procedure for the transaction of its business and its organization not inconsistent with this ordinance.
(2) An investigation and report describing the significance of the buildings, structures,
features, sites or surroundings included in any such proposed district, and the description of the
boundaries of such district has been prepared, and
(3) Principles and guidelines have been prepared and adopted for constructing, altering,
restoring, moving or demolishing properties designated as a part of a district, that are not inconsistent
with this ordinance.
(4) The Department of Cultural Resources, acting through the State Historic Preservation
Officer or his or her designee, shall have made an analysis of and recommendations concerning such
report and description of proposed boundaries. Failure of the department to submit its written analysis
and recommendations to the City Council within 30 calendar days after a written request for such
analysis has been received by the Department of Cultural Resources shall relieve the municipality of
any responsibility for awaiting such analysis and said City Council may at any time thereafter take any
necessary action to adopt or amend its zoning ordinance.
(5) The City Council may also, in its discretion, refer the report and the proposed boundaries
to any other interested body for its recommendation prior to taking action to amend the zoning
ordinance. With respect to any changes in the boundaries of such district subsequent to its initial
establishment, or the creation of additional districts within the jurisdiction, the investigative studies and
reports required by subdivision (3) of this section shall be prepared by the Commission and shall be
referred to the Planning Board for its review and comment according to procedures set forth in the
zoning ordinance. Changes in the boundaries of an initial district or proposal for additional districts
shall also be submitted to the Department of Cultural Resources in accordance with the provisions of
subdivision (4) of this section.
(6) On receipt of these reports and recommendations the city may proceed in the same
manner as would otherwise be required for the adoption of amendment of any appropriate zoning
ordinance provisions.

historical, prehistorical, architectural or cultural importance and to possess integrity of design, setting,
workmanship, materials, feeling and/or association.
(B) The ordinance shall describe each property designated in the ordinance, the name or names of
the owner or owners of the property, those elements of the property that are integral to its historical,
architectural, or prehistorical value, including the land areas of the property so designated and any
other information the City Council deems necessary. For each building, structure, site, area or object
so designated as a historic landmark, the ordinance shall require that the waiting period set forth in
G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 19, Part 3C and § 2-117 of this article be observed prior to its demolition.
For each designated landmark the ordinance may also provide for a suitable sign on the property

there to shall be given to the Codes Inspector. The fact that a building, structure, site, area or object has
been designated a landmark shall be clearly indicated on all tax records as maintained by the city as
may be appropriate for such period as the designation remains in effect.

sign shall be erected, altered, restored, moved or demolished on such landmark or within such district
until after an application for a certificate of appropriateness as to exterior features has been submitted
to and approved by the Commission. The city shall require such a certificate to be issued by the
Commission prior to the issuance of a building permit or other permit granted for the purposes of
constructing, altering, moving or demolishing structures, which certificate may be issued subject to

spaces shall be limited to specific interior features of architectural, artistic or historical significance in
publicly owned landmarks; and of privately owned historic landmarks for which consent for interior

guidelines to require the reconstruction or restoration of individual or original buildings or prohibit the
demolition, except as provided in § 2-117(3) of this article, or removal of same or to impose
architectural styles from particular historic periods. In considering new construction on a landmark or
in a historic district the Commission shall encourage contemporary design which is harmonious with
the character of the district.
(C) The following criteria shall be considered, when relevant, along with companion design
guidelines and the guidelines of the Secretary of the Interior in reviewing an application for a
certificate of appropriateness:
(1) Lot coverage, defined as the percentage of lot area covered by primary structures.
(2) Setback, defined as the distance from the lot lines to the building(s).

§ 2-117 DELAY IN DEMOLITION OF LANDMARKS AND BUILDINGS WITHIN HISTORIC
DISTRICTS.
(A) An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition or destruction of
a designated landmark or a building, structure, or site within the district may not be denied except as
provided in subsection (C) below. However, the effective date of such a certificate may be delayed for
a period of up to 365 days from the date of approval. The maximum period of delay authorized by this
section shall be reduced by the Commission where it finds that the owner would suffer extreme
hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use or return from such property by virtue of the
delay. During such period the Commission shall negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in
an effort to find a means of preserving the building or site. If the Commission finds that a building or
site within the historic district has no special significance or value toward maintaining the character of
the district, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal. If the
Commission or Planning Board has voted to recommend designation of a property as a landmark or
designation of an area as a district, and final designation has not been made by the City Council, the
demolition or destruction of any building, site or structure located on the property of the proposed
landmark or in the proposed district may be delayed by the Commission or Planning Board for a period
of up to 180 days or until the City Council takes final action on the designation, whichever occurs first.
(B) The City Council may enact an ordinance to prevent the demolition by neglect of any
designated landmark or any building or structure within an established historic district. Such ordinance
shall provide appropriate safeguards to protect property owners from undue economic hardship.
(C) An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition or destruction of
a building, site or structure determined by the State Historic Preservation Officer as having statewide
significance as defined in the criteria of the National Register of Historic Places may be denied except
where the Commission finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived
of all beneficial use or return by virtue of the denial.

participation in the matter. The member shall not sit with the Commission during the consideration and

applicability of this section to a particular decision or set of facts. The response to such a request shall
be made to the member making the request, and a copy shall be provided to the chairman of the
Commission. By majority vote, the Commission may seek the opinion of the City Attorney as to the
applicability of this section to a particular decision or set of facts.
(4) If an opinion is received from the City Attorney that a member has an impermissible
conflict of interest pursuant to a particular decision or set of facts and the member does not disqualify
himself or herself, the Commission may by majority vote (not considering the vote of the member with
the alleged conflict) disqualify that member from all participation in the matter involved.

considered by the Commission prior to the consideration of the matter at a duly authorized meeting.

(3) It shall be the duty of every Commission member to avoid even the appearance of conflict of
interest. Therefore, no member shall vote on, discuss, debate, advocate, influence, or otherwise
participate before the Commission in any matter that would substantially affect, directly or indirectly,
his or her personal financial interests or the financial interests of a member of his household. This
prohibition includes formal or informal consideration of the matter by the Commission, whether
conducted in public or private. This provision does not prohibit participation in advisory decisions that
will have a similar effect on all citizens of the Eden planning area or in which the financial interest is
so insignificant or remote that it is unlikely to affect the member's official action in any way. In
applying this rule, the following procedure shall govern:
Planning Organization 43
(a) A member who has a conflict of interest shall disqualify himself and withdraw from
participation in the matter. The member shall not sit with the Commission during the consideration and
discussion of that matter.
(b) Withdrawal from participation in any matter is necessary only in those specific cases in which a
conflict arises. There shall be no attempt to exclude entire categories of consideration because of the
business or profession with which a member is associated.
(c) Any Commission member may seek an opinion from the City Attorney as to the applicability of
this section to a particular decision or set of facts. The response to such a request shall be made to the
member making the request, and a copy shall be provided to the chairman of the Commission. By
majority vote, the Commission may seek the opinion of the City Attorney as to the applicability of this
section to a particular decision or set of facts.
(d) If an opinion is received from the City Attorney that a member has an impermissible conflict of
interest pursuant to a particular decision or set of facts and the member does not disqualify himself or
herself, the commission may, by majority vote (not considering the vote of the member with the
alleged conflict) disqualify that member from all participation in the matter involved.
(4) Members of the Commission shall not commit themselves on any question scheduled to be
considered by the Commission prior to the consideration of the matter at a duly authorized meeting.
Members shall use discretion in discussing with individuals scheduled agenda items which are later to
be voted on by the Commission.

2012)
§ 2-251 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
The City Manager, or designee, is authorized to conduct an investigation of an individual’s criminal
history when required by the City Code. The individual shall upon request provide fingerprints and all
other necessary personal identification, including a birth certificate, social security number, and drivers
license, if available, so the city manager or designee, may cause a thorough search to be made of local
and state criminal records to determine if the individual has a history of criminal convictions by use of
the Division of Criminal Information Network (DCIN). The City of Eden police department shall
provide the findings from the use of the DCIN to the city manager, provided that all necessary
agreements with the State Bureau of Investigation Criminal Information and Identification Section
have been executed. (Ord. passed 10-21-08) (Am. Ord. passed 10-16-2012)
§ 2-252 PROCEDURE FOR EVALUATION.
(A) If the Criminal History Record Inquiry (CHRI) received from the City of Eden Police Department
indicates the existence of a possible record, the City Manager or designee shall verify existence of a
63

64 Eden - Administration
record by either obtaining a certified public record or by submitting a fingerprint card of the individual
to the State Bureau of Investigation Criminal Information and Identification Section for verification
that the CHRI record belongs to the individual.
(B) If any criminal history check verifies a prior record for the individual, the applicable clerk
of court shall be contacted to obtain the record. The City of Eden shall pay the cost of obtaining a
criminal history record check; and other than for employment or volunteer purposes, the subject
individual shall reimburse the City for said cost.
(C) Any evaluation of a criminal history record for an individual will take into account the
nature, circumstances, and time frame of the offense as it relates to the purpose for which the search
was originally required.
§ 2-253 CONFIDENTIALITY.
The information provided by the individual and the information obtained by the criminal history
check is sensitive information, and parties handling the information shall comply with all laws and
regulations concerning non-public confidential information.

(C) Tethering: It shall be unlawful for any person to tether a dog in a manner as to cause
injury, strangulation or entanglement of the animal on fences, trees, or other manmade or natural
obstacles; or to a fixed-point; or that is under four (4) months of age; or that is sick or injured. It
shall be unlawful to fail to provide any dog with adequate space. "Adequate space" means sufficient
space to allow each dog to easily stand, sit, lie, turnabout, and make all other normal body
movements in a comfortable, normal position for the dog and interact safely with other animals in
the enclosure.
When a dog is tethered, "adequate space" means a tether that permits the above actions and is
appropriate to the age and size of the dog. The tether must be attached to the dog by a properly
applied collar, halter, or harness configured so as to protect the dog from injury and prevent the dog
or the tether from becoming entangled with other objects or animals, or from extending over an
object or edge that could result in the strangulation or injury of the dog.
Fixed. Tethered dogs must be attached to a swiveled ground anchor by a coated cable wire at
least fifteen (15) feet in length and of sufficient strength to restrain the dog without breaking
Chains, ropes, twine, cords and non-cable wire are not acceptable types of tethers. All tethers
must have swivels attached at both ends to prevent twisting. The area shall be free of garbage
and other debris that can harm the dog. There shall be no fences or objects within the radius
of the tether that the dog can get hung upon. The tether must be arranged so as to be free
from obstacles that may limit the movable length of the tether. Tethers must be attached to a
safe and secure harness or collar. Under no circumstances shall the tether be placed directly
around the dog’s neck. Tethers are never to be used in conjunction with training collars such
as choke or pinch prong style collars. Shelter and water must be present and always within
reach of a tethered dog. If a tethered dog cannot reach its shelter or water due to a tangled or
shortened tether or if the tether does not meet the requirements of this section, the owner or
keeper of the dog is considered to be in violation.
Running cable line or "trolley system." A running cable line (minimum of fifteen (15) feet in
length) must be firmly secured to fixed anchor points (i.e. posts, trees or fences) and attached
at least four (4) feet but not more than seven (7) feet above ground. The tether shall be
attached to the running cable line and must have a swivel at both ends to prevent
entanglement and must have a stopper device attached near each end of the running cable line
to prevent the cable wire tether from entangling around the anchor points. The running cable
line must be of sufficient strength to support the tether cable wire and restrain the dog without
breaking. Tethers must be attached to a safe and secure harness or collar. Under no
circumstances shall the tether be placed directly around the dog’s neck. Tethers are never to
be used in conjunction with training collars such as choke or pinch style collars. Only one (1)
animal may be tethered to a single running cable line or trolley system. Shelter and water
must be present and always within reach of the tethered dog. If the tethered dog cannot reach
the shelter or water due to a tangled or shortened tether, or if the running cable line or trolley
system does not meet the requirements of this section, the owner or keeper of the dog is
considered to be in violation.
(D)Adequate Shelter: No person owning or responsible for any animal shall fail to provide the
animal with proper shelter, protection from the weather or humanely clean conditions as prescribed
in this section.
In General 7
Adequate shelter means provision of and access to shelter that is suitable for the species, age,
condition, size, and type of each animal; provides adequate space for each animal; is safe and
protects each animal from injury, rain, sleet, snow, hail, direct sunlight, the adverse effects of
heat or cold, physical suffering, and impairment of health; is properly cleaned; enables each
animal to be clean and dry, except when detrimental to the species; and, for dogs and cats
provides a solid surface, level resting platform, pad, floor mat, or similar device that is large
enough for the dog or cat to lie on in a normal manner and can be maintained in a sanitary
manner. Adequate shelters for a dog or cat should consist of (3) walls, a top and a floor.
Under this chapter, shelters whose wire, grid, or slat floor (i) permit the animal’s feet to pass
through the openings, (ii) sag under the animal’s weight, or (iii) otherwise do not protect the
animal’s feet or toes from injury are not adequate shelter. Crawl spaces under building/decks,
under or in a vehicle, made from materials easily degraded by the elements, carriers or crates
designed for temporary housing are not defined as adequate shelter. When sunlight is likely
to cause heat exhaustion of an animal tied or confined outside, sufficient shade by natural or
artificial means shall be provided to protect the animal from direct sunlight.
(E) Adequate Food & Water
Adequate food: The provision at suitable intervals, of a quantity of wholesome foodstuff
suitable for the species and age, sufficient to maintain a reasonable level of nutrition in each
animal. Such foodstuff shall be served in a receptacle, dish, or container that is physically
clean.
Adequate water – Means provision of and access to clean, fresh, potable water of a drinkable
temperature which is provided in a suitable manner, in sufficient volume, and a suitable
intervals, to maintain normal hydration for the age, species, condition, size and type of each
animal; and is provided in clean, durable receptacles which are accessible to each animal and
are placed so as to minimize contamination of the water by excrement and pests or an
alternative source of hydration consistent with generally accepted husbandry practices.
(F) Properly fitted collars required. An owner of a dog or cat shall not permit injury or inflict
pain upon such animal from an improperly fitting or embedded collar.
(G) Any act in which an animal found to have been treated in a manner inconsistent with this
Article is made unlawful by this section and may be taken up and impounded by the Animal Control
Officer. Redemption of such animal may be made by the owner thereof upon compliance with the
requirements of § 3-68; provided, however, that the Animal Control Officer may impose such other
requirements for redemption as are appropriate to ensure treatment of such animal dog that complies
with this section.

§ 4-88 PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION; NOTICE; HEARING.
(A) Whenever a petition is filed with the Director by a public authority or by at least five residents
of the jurisdiction charging that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, or
whenever it appears to the Director, upon inspection, that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for
human habitation, the Director shall, if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges,
issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such dwelling or dwelling unit
a complaint stating the charges and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the Director
(or his designated agent) at a place therein fixed, not less than ten nor more than 30 days after the
serving of said complaint. The owner or any party in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the
complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the
complaint. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in

as applicable. Upon compliance with the requirements of any order issued based upon such complaint
and hearing the Codes Inspector shall direct the Clerk of Superior Court to cancel the notice of lis

§ 4-89 PROCEDURE AFTER HEARING.
(A) If, after such notice and hearing, the Director determines that the dwelling under consideration
is unfit for human habitation in accordance with the standards herein set forth, the Director shall state
in writing his findings of fact in support of that determination and shall issue and cause to be served
upon the owner thereof an order:
(1) Unfit for human habitation, but subject to correction at a reasonable cost. If the Director
determines that said dwelling is unfit for human habitation, the order shall require the owner, within a
time specified, to repair, alter, and improve such dwelling so as to render it fit for human habitation.
Such order may also direct and require the owner to vacate and close the dwelling until such repairs,
alterations, and improvements have been made and/or the unsafe and dangerous character of such
dwelling has been corrected.
(2) Dilapidated dwellings. If the Director determines that said dwelling is dilapidated, the
order shall require the owner, within a specified period of time, to either vacate and repair, alter or
improve such dwelling so as to bring it into compliance with the standards described herein, or to
vacate and close the dwelling, and to remove or demolish the dwelling. However, notwithstanding any
other provision of law, if the dwelling is located in a historic district of the city and the Historic
Preservation Commission determines, after public hearing as provided by ordinance, that the dwelling
is of particular significance or value toward maintaining the character of the district, and the dwelling
Human Habitation Standards 35
has not been condemned as unsafe, the order may require that the dwelling be vacated and closed
consistent with G.S. § 160A-400.14(a).
(B) Whenever a determination is made pursuant to subsection (A) of this section that a dwelling
must be vacated and closed, or removed or demolished, under the provisions of this section, notice and
order shall be given by first-class mail to any organization involved in providing or restoring dwellings
for affordable housing that has filed a written request for such notices. A minimum period of 45 days
from the mailing of such notice shall be given before the removal or demolition by action of the
Director, to allow the opportunity for any organization to negotiate with the owner to make repairs,
lease, or purchase the property for the purpose of providing affordable housing. The Director or Clerk
shall certify the mailing of the notices, and the certification shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud.
Only an organization that has filed a written request for such notices may raise the issue of failure to
mail such notices, and the sole remedy shall be an order requiring the Director to wait 45 days before
causing removal or demolition.
(Ord. passed 5-15-95)
§ 4-90 FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ORDER; OWNER.
(A) If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter or improve the dwelling, the Director
may:
(1) Cause such dwelling to be repaired, altered or improved, and pending such repairs,
alterations or improvements, may order such dwelling vacated and closed.
(2) Cause to be posted on the main entrance of any dwelling so closed a placard with the
following words: “This building is unfit for human habitation; the use or occupation of this building for
human habitation is prohibited and unlawful.” Occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a
Class 1 misdemeanor.
(B) If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the dwelling, the Director
may:
(1) Cause such dwelling to be vacated and closed, removed or demolished.
(2) Cause to be posted on the main entrance of any dwelling so closed a placard with the
following words: “This building is unfit for human habitation; the use or occupation of this building for
human habitation is prohibited and unlawful.” Occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a
Class 1 misdemeanor.
(C) The duties of the Director set forth in subsections (A) and (B) shall not be exercised until the
City Council, by ordinance, shall have ordered the Director to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this
article with respect to the particular property or properties which the Director shall have found to be
2017 S-40
36 Eden - Building Regulation and Codes Enforcement
unfit for human habitation and which property or properties shall be described in the ordinance. No
such ordinance shall be adopted to require demolition of a dwelling until the owner has first been given
a reasonable opportunity to bring it into conformity with this article. Such ordinances shall be recorded
in the office of the Register of Deeds of Rockingham County and shall be indexed in the name of the
property owner in the grantor index.
(D) If the Director shall have issued an order, ordering a dwelling to be repaired or vacated and
closed, as provided in Section 4-89(1), and if the dwelling has been vacated and closed for a period of
one year pursuant to the order; then if the City Council shall find that the owner has abandoned the
intent and purpose to repair, alter or improve the dwelling in order to render it fit for human habitation
and that the continuation of the dwelling in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the
health, safety, morals and welfare of the municipality in that the dwelling would continue to
deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants, would
attract persons intent on criminal activities, would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of
property values in the area, and would render unavailable property and a dwelling which might
otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent and affordable housing in
this State, then in such circumstances, the City Council may, after the expiration of such one year
period, enact an ordinance and serve such ordinance on the owner, setting for the following:
(1) If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it fit for human habitation can
be made at a cost not exceeding fifty percent (50%) of the then current value of the
dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner either repair or demolish and remove
the dwelling within 90 days; or
(2) If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it fit for human habitation
cannot be made at a cost not exceeding fifty percent (50%) of the then current value of the
dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to demolish and remove the dwelling
within 90 days.
This ordinance shall be recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Rockingham County and
shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. If the owner fails to comply
with this ordinance, the Director shall effectuate the purpose of the ordinance.
(E) The amount of the cost of repairs, alterations or improvements, or vacating and closing, or
removal or demolition by the Director shall be a lien against the real property upon which the cost was
incurred, which lien shall be filed, have the same priority, and be collected as the lien for special
assessment provided by G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 10. If the dwelling is removed or demolished by
the Director, he shall sell the materials of such dwelling, and any personal property, fixtures or
appurtenances found in or attached to the dwelling, and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against
the cost of the removal or demolition and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the Superior
Court of Rockingham County by the Director, shall be secured in a manner directed by the court, and
shall be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of the
court.

(A) If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling, the Director may file a civil
action in the name of the city to remove such occupant. The action to vacate the dwelling shall be in
the nature of summary ejectment and shall be commenced by filing a complaint naming as
parties-defendant any person occupying such dwelling.
(B) The Clerk of Superior Court of Rockingham County shall issue a summons requiring the
defendant to appear before a magistrate at a certain time, date and place not to exceed ten days from the
issuance of the summons to answer the complaint. The summons and complaint shall be served as
provided in G.S. § 42-29. The summons shall be returned according to its tenor, and if on its return it
appears to have been duly served, and if at the hearing the Director produces a certified copy of an
ordinance adopted by the City Council pursuant to § 4-90, subsection (c) of this article, authorizing the
Director to proceed to vacate the occupied building, the magistrate shall enter judgment ordering that
the premises be vacated and that all persons be removed. The judgment ordering that the dwelling be
vacated shall be enforced in the same manner as the judgment for summary ejectment entered under
G.S. § 42-30.
(C) An appeal from any judgment entered hereunder by the magistrate may be taken as provided
in G.S. § 7A-228, and the execution of such judgment may be stayed as provided in G.S. § 7A-227. An
action to remove an occupant of a dwelling who is a tenant of the owner may not be taken in the nature
of a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant to this section unless such occupant was served with
notice at least 30 days before the filing of the summary ejectment proceeding that the City Council has
ordered the Director to proceed to exercise his duties under § 4-90, subsections (A) and (B) of this
article, to vacate and close, or to remove and demolish the dwelling.

deemed sufficient if the registered or certified mail is unclaimed or refused, but the regular mail is not
returned by the post office within ten days after the mailing. If regular mail is used, a notice of the
pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises affected.

ascertained by the Director in the exercise of reasonable diligence, or, if the owners are known but have
refused to accept service by registered or certified mail, and the public officer makes an affidavit to that
effect, then the serving of the complaint or order upon the owners or other persons may be made by

§ 4-125 LIMITATIONS ON ORDERS AND ORDINANCES – HISTORIC LANDMARK
OR HISTORIC DISTRICT.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, if the non-residential building or structure is
designated as a local historic landmark, listed in the National Register of Historic Places, or
located in a locally designated historic district or in a historic district listed in the National
Register of Historic Places and the city council determines, after a public hearing, that the nonresidential
building or structure is of individual significance or contributes to maintaining the
character of the district, and the non-residential building or structure has not been condemned as
unsafe, an order issued by the Director pursuant to Section 4-124(c) and an ordinance approved
by city council pursuant to section 4-124 (d) may only require that the non-residential building or
structure be vacated and closed until it is brought into compliance with the minimum standards

the building or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or vacated and closed and the
building or structure has been vacated and closed for a period of two (2) years pursuant to the
ordinance or order, then if the city council finds that the owner has abandoned the intent and
purpose to repair, alter, or improve the building or structure and that the continuation of the
building or structure in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health, safety, and
welfare of the city in that it would continue to deteriorate, would create a fire or safety hazard,
would be a threat to children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities, or
would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in the area, then city
council may, after the expiration of the two (2) year period, adopt an ordinance and serve such
ordinance on the owner, setting forth the following:
(1) The ordinance shall require that the owner either (i) demolish and remove the nonresidential

by regular mail. When the manner or service is by regular mail in conjunction with registered or
certified mail, and the registered or certified mail is unclaimed or refused, but the regular mail is
not returned by the post office within ten (10) days after mailing, service shall be deemed

the date thereof, and such certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. If regular mail is
used, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises
thereby affected.
(b) If the identities of any owner or the whereabouts of persons are unknown and cannot be
ascertained by the Director in the exercise of reasonable diligence, and the Director makes an
affidavit to that effect, then the serving of the complaint or order upon the unknown owners or
other persons may be made by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the city at

the Director pursuant to section 4-123(d)(d) or section 4-132 shall be a lien against the real
property upon which such costs were incurred. Such lien shall be filed, have the same priority,
and be enforced and the costs collected as provided by Article 10, Chapter 160A of the North
Carolina General Statutes. The amount of the costs shall also be a lien on any other real property
of the owner located within the city limits except for the owner's primary residence. The
additional lien provided in this subdivision is inferior to all prior liens and shall be collected as a
money judgment.

credit the proceeds of the sale, if any, against the cost of the removal or demolition, and any
balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court by the Director, shall be secured in a
manner directed by the court, and shall be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be
entitled thereto by final order or decree of the court. Nothing in this section shall be construed to

Director may file a civil action in the name of the city to remove the occupant. The action to
vacate shall be in the nature of summary ejectment and shall be commenced by filing a complaint
naming as parties-defendant any person occupying the non-residential building or structure. The

magistrate at a certain time, date, and place not to exceed 10 days from the issuance of the
summons to answer the complaint. The summons and complaint shall be served as provided in
G.S. 42-29. The summons shall be returned according to its tenor, and if on its return it appears
to have been duly served and if at the hearing the Director produces a certified copy of an
ordinance adopted by the city council pursuant to G.S. 160A-493(f) and Section 4-123(d)(d) to
vacate the occupied non-residential building or structure, the magistrate shall enter judgment
ordering that the premises be vacated and all persons be removed. The judgment ordering that the
non-residential building or structure be vacated shall be enforced in the same manner as the
judgment for summary ejectment entered under G.S. 42-30. An appeal from any judgment
entered under this subsection by the magistrate may be taken as provided in G.S. 7A-228, and the
execution of the judgment may be stayed as provided in G.S. 7A-227. An action to remove an
60 Eden - Building Regulation and Codes Enforcement

nature of a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant to this subsection unless the occupant was
served with notice, at least thirty (30) days before the filing of the summary ejectment
proceeding, that the City Council has ordered the Director to proceed to exercise his duties under
G.S. 160A-493(f) and Section 4-127 to vacate and close or remove and demolish the nonresidential

Director and with the Board of Adjustment a notice of appeal which shall specify the
grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the
Director shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon
which the decision appealed from was made. When the appeal is from a decision of the
Director refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, the Director’s
decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a
decision of the Director requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall
have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the board, unless the
Director certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal is filed, that by reason of the facts
stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant) a suspension of
the requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the
requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted
Non-Residential Building Maintenance Standards 61
for due cause shown upon not less than one (1) day’s written notice to the Director, by the
board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G. S. 160A-446 (f) and
Section 4-123.
(2) The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals, shall give
notice to all the parties, and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party
may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The board may reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make such decision
and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all
the powers of the Director, but the concurring vote of four-fifths of the members of the
board shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the Director. The
board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case when practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of this
article, to adapt the application of the article to the necessities of the case to the end that
the spirit of the article shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and
substantial justice done.

pay plan. All employees covered by the pay plan shall be paid at a rate listed within the salary range
established for the respective position classification, except for employees in trainee status or employees
whose existing salaries are above the established maximum rate following transition to a new pay plan.
(B) The pay plan is intended to provide equitable compensation for all positions, reflecting
differences in the duties and responsibilities, the comparable rates of pay for positions in private and public
employment in the area, changes in the cost of living, the financial conditions of the city, and other factors.
To this end, from time to time the City Manager or designee shall make comparative studies of all factors

affecting the level of salary ranges. When major adjustments encompassing numerous positions are
needed, or when a general adjustment is needed to the pay plan, the City Manager shall recommend
such changes in salary ranges as appear to be warranted to the City Council. The City Council shall
adopt the “Assignment of Classes to Grades and Ranges,” including any minor adjustments made by
the City Manager during the previous budget year, annually as part of the budget process.
(C) The City Manager shall have the right to make minor individual salary adjustments to various
job classifications and individuals based upon job performance or comparable data for similar positions
in similarly sized communities subject to the appropriation and availability of funds for this purpose in
the annual operating budget. A minor adjustment in salary shall not exceed more than 8% in a given
fiscal year; and any adjustment in salary in excess of 8% shall be approved by the City Council.

schedule, must be prepared by the department head. “Trainee” salaries may be no more than two grades
below the minimum salary established for the position for which the person is being trained. A new
employee designated as “trainee” shall be regarded as a probationary employee.

§ 10-3.6 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND PERFORMANCE PAY INCREASES.
Supervisors or department heads should fill out performance evaluations on each full-time
employee annually on the employee's anniversary date or job date. In addition, supervisors or
department heads are responsible for informal evaluation conferences during the course of the year to

§ 10-3.8 SALARY EFFECT OF PROMOTIONS, DEMOTIONS, TRANSFERS,
RECLASSIFICATIONS, REASSIGNMENTS, SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS AND

(A) Promotions.
(1) When an employee is promoted, the employee's salary shall normally be advanced to the
minimum level of the new position, or to a salary which provides an increase of at least 5% over the
employee's salary before the promotion, provided, however, that the new salary may not exceed the
maximum rate of the new salary range. The purpose of the promotion pay increase is to recognize and
compensate the employee for taking on increased responsibility.
(2) When a city employee bids and receives a position that was advertised inside or outside
the city for a certain starting salary, they cannot receive any starting pay other than what would be
equal to what all applicants would receive with equal qualifications. In no event shall they make more
than the maximum of that position until the City Council approves the change.
(B) Demotions. When an employee is demoted the salary shall be decreased by at least 5%.
(C) Transfers. The salary of an employee transferred to a position in the same class or to a
position in a different class within the same salary range shall not be changed by the transfer.
2014 S32
12 Eden - Personnel
(D) Reclassifications. An employee whose position is reclassified to a class having a higher pay
range shall receive a pay increase of 5% or an increase to the minimum of the new pay range,
whichever is higher. If the position is reclassified to a lower pay range, the employee's salary shall
remain the same. If the employee's salary is above the maximum established for the new range, the
salary of that employee shall be maintained at the current level until the range is increased above the
employee's salary.
(E) Reassignment. An employee who is reassigned to a position in a higher pay range shall
receive a pay increase of 5% or an increase to the minimum of the new pay range, whichever is higher.
If the employee is reassigned to a position in a lower pay range, the employee's salary may be retained
at the discretion of the City Manager if the current salary is within the new pay range. In the event the
employee's salary is above the maximum of the new pay range, the employee's salary will be decreased
to the maximum of the new pay range.
(F) Special assignment. When an employee's pay is increased to compensate the employee for
additional duties and responsibilities, the employee's pay will be accordingly decreased when such
employee is relieved of those additional duties and responsibilities.
(G) Certifications. If an employee receives certification from a state or nationally recognized
agency, the employee will receive a 5% increase in salary. The certification must be approved in
writing by the City Manager prior to the employee seeking certification. A certification shall be
deemed acceptable when the employee provides a copy of the certification to their respective
department head and to the Human Resources Department. Increases in salaries are subject to § 10-
3.10 of this article.

a pay increase of at least 5% or to the minimum step of the new range, whichever is higher. When a
class of positions is assigned to a lower salary range, the salaries of employees in that class will remain
unchanged. If this assignment to a lower salary range results in an employee being paid at a rate above
the maximum step established for the new class, the salary of that employee shall be maintained at that
level until such time as the employee's salary range is increased above the employee's current salary.

§ 10-3.11 OVERTIME PAY PROVISIONS.
(A) Employees of the city can be requested and may be required to work overtime hours as
necessitated by the needs of the city and determined by the department head, with the prior approval of
the City Manager. The standard workweek (168 consecutive hours) for the city is Wednesday, 12:01
a.m. to Tuesday 12:00 midnight. With approval of the City Manager, the standard workweek may be
changed at the request of the department head(s).
(B) To the extent that local governmental jurisdictions are so required, the city will comply with
the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The City Manager, assisted by the personnel specialist, shall
determine which jobs are “non-exempt” and are therefore subject to the Act in areas such as hours of
work and work periods, rates of overtime compensation, and other provisions. Non-exempt employees
will be paid at a straight time rate for hours up to the FLSA established limit for their position (usually
40 hours in a 7-day period; hours for public safety personnel may be different). Hours worked by nonexempt
employees beyond the FLSA established limit will be compensated in either time or pay at the
appropriate overtime rate. Compensatory time may be granted if requested by the employee and
approved by the Department Head. In no event shall the amount of compensatory time exceed the
maximum accumulation of compensatory time for each department, except that in emergency and/or
special situations the City Manager may approve additional compensatory time over and above the
maximum allowed. Non-exempt employees who have accumulated the maximum amount of
compensatory time will be paid for all hours worked. Maximum accumulation of compensatory time
shall be set as follows:
Public safety—Police
240 hours
Public safety—Fire
240 hours
Non-exempt personnel
80 hours
Exempt personnel
60 hours
(C) In determining eligibility for overtime in a work period, only hours actually worked shall be
considered; in no event will vacation, sick leave, compensatory time taken, or holidays be included in
the computation of hours worked for FLSA purposes. Whenever practicable, departments will
schedule time off on an hour-for-hour basis within the applicable work period for non-exempt
employees, instead of paying overtime. When time off within the work period cannot be granted,
overtime worked will be paid in accordance with the FLSA.
(D) In emergency situations, where employees are required to work long and continuous hours,
the City Manager may approve compensation at time and one half for those hours worked and/or grant
time off with pay for rest and recuperation to ensure safe working conditions.
2014 S32
14 Eden - Personnel
(E) Employees in positions determined to be “exempt” from the FLSA (as executive,
administrative, or professional staff) will not receive pay for hours worked in excess of their normal
work periods. These employees will be granted compensatory leave by their department heads where
the convenience of the department allows and in accordance with procedures established by the City
Manager. Such compensatory time is not guaranteed to be taken and ends without compensation upon
separation from the organization.

§ 10-3.12 CALL-BACK AND STANDBY PAY.
The city provides a continuous 24 hour a day, seven day a week service to its customers.
Therefore, it is necessary for certain employees to respond to any reasonable request for duty at any
hour of the day or night. One of the conditions of employment with the city is the acceptance of a share
of the responsibility for continuous service, in accordance with the nature of each job position. If an
employee fails to respond to reasonable calls for emergency service, either special or routine, the
employee shall be subject to disciplinary actions up to and including dismissal.
(A) Call-back. Non-exempt full-time employees will be guaranteed a minimum payment of two
hour's wages for being called back to work outside of normal working hours. “Call-back” provisions do
not apply to previously scheduled overtime work or employees who are called to work while serving in
a “on call” capacity. Hours worked when responding to emergency call-back will be compensated at
time and one-half.
(B) On call. Non-exempt full-time employees required to be on “on call” duty will be paid for
eight hours of work for each week (approximately 128 hours, excluding work time) of on call time they
serve. On call compensation for less than one full week shall be determined by the ratio of .062 hours
of pay per one hour of on call time. Hours actually worked while on call are calculated beginning when
the employee reports to the work site and are added to the regular total of hours worked for the week.
On call time is defined as that time when an employee is required and must remain near an established
telephone or within the restricted beeper range.

§ 10-7.19 MILITARY LEAVE.
Regular employees who are members of an Armed Forces Reserve organization or National Guard
shall be granted ten workdays per year for military leave without pay. On rare occasions due to training
being scheduled on a federal fiscal year basis, an employee may be required to attend two periods of
training in one calendar year. For this purpose only, an employee shall be granted an additional ten
days of military leave during the same calendar year without pay. Provided that, if the compensation
received while on military leave is less than the salary that would have been earned during this same
period as a city employee, the employee shall receive partial compensation equal to the difference the
base salary earned during this same period as a city employee. The effect will be to maintain the
employee's salary at the normal level during this period. If such duty is required beyond this ten
workdays, the employee shall be eligible to take accumulated leave or be placed in a leave without pay
status, and the provisions of that leave shall apply. While taking military leave without pay or with
partial pay, the employee's leave credits and other benefits shall continue to accrue as if the employee

the nearest approximation of the seniority, status, and pay which the employee otherwise would have
been provided, if available.
(Ord. passed 5-17-94)
§ 10-7.21 CIVIL LEAVE.
(A) A city employee called for jury duty or as a court witness for the federal or state governments,

witness fees or travel allowance awarded by that court for court appearances in connection with official
duties. While on civil leave, benefits and leave shall accrue as though on regular duty.
(B) Should a person be scheduled for civil leave on a day when he or she is on a second or third

§ 10-7.23 FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE POLICY (FMLA).
(A) Employees who have worked for the city for at least 12 months and at least 1,250 hours
during the prior 12-month period may take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave (FMLA leave) for the
following reasons:
36 Eden - Personnel
(1) Both birth or care of a child of the employee;
(2) Placement of a child into the employee's family by adoption or by a foster care
arrangement;
(3) Care of the employee's spouse, child or parent who has a serious health condition; or
(4) Inability of the employee to perform the functions of the employee's position due to a
serious health condition.
(B) Any employee using sick leave, vacation leave or compensatory time for any FMLA purpose
will have that paid leave counted toward their 12 weeks of FMLA leave.
(C) Any FMLA leave taken by an employee during the preceding 12-month period will be used to
determine the amount of available leave pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act.
(D) The right to family leave for the birth or placement of a child in an employee's family may
only be taken within the 12 months after the date of the birth or placement of the child. In the case of
unpaid leave for the birth or placement of a child, intermittent leave or working a reduced number of
hours is not permitted, unless both the employee and the City Manager agree in writing. If both
spouses are employed by the city, the combined leave shall not exceed 12 weeks.
(E) For purposes of this policy, a serious health condition means an illness, injury, impairment or
physical or mental condition that involves:
(1) Any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with or consequent to in-patient care
in hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility;
(2) Any period of incapacity requiring absence from work or other regular daily activities for
more than three calendar days that also involves continuous treatment by or under the supervision of a
health care provider;
(3) Continuous treatment by or under the supervision of a healthcare provider for a chronic
long-term health condition that is incurable or so serious that if not treated would result in a period of
incapacity of more than three calendar days; or
(4) Prenatal care.
(F) In the case of unpaid leave for serious health conditions, the leave may be taken intermittently
or on a reduced hours basis only if such leave is medically necessary. Where an employee requests
intermittent leave or leave on a reduced hours basis due to a family member's or the employee's own
serious health condition, the City Manager has the option, in their sole discretion, to require the
employee to transfer to a temporary alternative job for which the employee is qualified and which
better accommodates the intermittent leave or reduced hours leave than the employee's regular job. The
temporary position will have equivalent pay and benefits as the employee's regular job.
Holidays and Leaves of Absence 37
(G) In order to be paid employees are required to use their available sick, vacation or
compensatory time during the 12-week family leave period. That portion of the family leave of absence
which is vacation time, compensatory time or sick time will be in accordance with city pay policies.
The employee will be notified in writing that their vacation, sick and/or compensatory time will be
counted towards the 12 weeks of family leave. If written notice is not given to the employee by the date
of expiration of the leave, the leave will not be counted towards the employee's available 12 weeks of
family leave.
(H) When the necessity of leave is foreseeable due to the expected birth or placement of a child,
the employee must provide the city with at least 30 days notice of the employee's intention to take
leave. If the date of birth or placement of a child requires the employee's leave to begin in less than 30
days, the employee must provide notice as soon as practical. Where the necessity of leave is due to a
family member's or employee's own serious health condition and is foreseeable based on a planned
medical treatment, the employee must:
(1) Give at least 30 days notice, or soon as practicable, if treatment starts in less than 30 days;
and
(2) Make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the
operation of the city, subject to the approval of the health care provider.
(I) Where the need of leave is unforeseeable, the employee must give notice as soon as practical.
Any leave request based on a family members or employee's own serious health condition must be
supported by certification from a healthcare provider. The employee must provide a copy of the
certification to the city in a timely manner. Certification from the healthcare provider must contain the
following:
(1) The date the serious health condition began;
(2) The possible duration of the condition; and
(3) The appropriate medical facts regarding the condition.
(J) If the leave is based on the care of a spouse, child or parent, a statement that the employee is
needed to provide the care and an estimate of the amount of time that need will continue;
(K) If the leave is based on the employee's own serious health condition, a statement that the
employee is unable to perform the functions of his/her job; and
(L) In the case of intermittent leave or leave on a reduced hours basis for planned medical
treatment, the date the treatment is expected to be given and the duration of the treatment.
(M) During family leave of absence, the city will continue to pay the health insurance premiums
for the employee; the employee must continue to pay his/her share of the dependent premium. Failure
of the employee to pay his/her share of the health insurance premium may result in loss of dependent
coverage. If the employee does not return to work after the expiration of the leave, the employee will
be required to reimburse the city for payment of health insurance premiums during family leave, unless
38 Eden - Personnel
the employee does not return because of the presence of a serious health condition which prevents the
employee from performing his or her job or circumstances beyond the employee's control.
(N) During unpaid leave, no benefits will be accrued.
(O) The city may require an employee on FMLA to report periodically on his/her status and the
intention of the employee to return to work. Also, periodic recertification of the medical condition may
be required. An employee taking family leave due to the employee's serious health condition will be
required to provide certification that the employee is able to resume work prior to returning to work.
(P) Employees who return to work from family leave of absence within or on the business day
following the expiration of the 12 weeks are entitled to return to their job or an equivalent position
without loss of pay or benefits.
(Q) In the event the employee cannot return to work at the end of the 12 weeks and the employee
has exhausted all paid leave, the employee may, at that time, request a leave without pay. The request
will be reviewed by the City Manager and the employee will be notified as soon as practical if the
request is approved or denied.
(R) Applications for family leave of absence must be submitted in writing and signed by the
employee's immediate supervisor or department head. Applications should be submitted at least 30
days before the leave is to commence or as soon as possible if 30 days notice is not possible.
Appropriate forms must be submitted to the Human Resource Department to initiate family leave or
return to work.

(A) In the event of a death in an employee's immediate family, the City Manager or designee shall
provide up to three days bereavement leave. In order to receive bereavement pay, the employee must
attend the funeral of the relative.
(B) “Immediate family” shall be defined as spouse, mother, father, guardian, children, sister,
brother, grandparents, grandchildren, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece plus the various combinations of half,
step, in-law and adopted relationships that can be derived from those named.

committee.
(B) Each member of the Committee shall be familiar with all statutes, laws, ordinances and rules
of procedure relating to the Committee as time and circumstances permit.
(C) It shall be the duty of every committee member to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of
interest. Therefore, no member shall vote on, discuss, debate, advocate, influence, or otherwise
participate before the committee in any matter that would substantially affect, directly or indirectly, his
or her personal interests or the financial interests of a member of his or her household. This prohibition
includes formal or informal consideration of the matter by the committee, whether conducted in public
or private. This provision does not prohibit participation in advisory decisions in which the personal
interest is so insignificant or remote that it is unlikely to affect the member's official action in any way.
In applying this rule the following procedure shall govern:
(1) A member who has a conflict of interest shall disqualify himself or herself and withdraw
from participation in the matter. The member shall not sit with the Committee during the consideration
and discussion of that matter;
(2) Withdrawal from participation in any matter is necessary only in those specific cases in
which a conflict arises. There shall be no attempt to exclude entire categories of consideration because
of the department/division with which a member is associated;
(3) Any committee member may seek an opinion from the Staff/City Attorney as to the
applicability of this section to a particular decision or set of facts. The response to such a request shall
be made to the member making the request, and a copy shall be provided to the chairman of the
committee and the City Manager.
(4) If an opinion is received from the Staff/City Attorney that a member has an impermissible
conflict of interest pursuant to a particular decision or set of facts and the member does not disqualify
himself or herself, the Committee may by majority vote (not considering the vote of the member with
the alleged conflict) disqualify that member from all participation in the matter involved.

are in the public interest. The consent of the city to such transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld.

cost-sharing arrangement shall consist of the following:
(1) On the request of five or more potential subscribers desiring service, the grantee shall prepare,
at its cost, an engineering survey and cost analysis to determine the cost of plant extension required to
provide service to each subscriber from the closest point where available quality signals exist.
(2) The cost of construction shall be allocated based on the following formula: If a request for
extension of service into a residential area requires the construction of cable plant which does not pass at
least 35 potential subscribers per strand or trench mile, the grantee and subscribers will each bear their
proportionate share of construction costs. For example, if there are 25 subscribers per strand mile or trench
mile, the grantee's share will equal 25/50th or one-half of construction cost. The remaining cost will be
shared equally by each subscriber. After completion of the project, should additional subscribers request
cable television service, the pro-rata shares shall be recalculated. Each new subscriber shall pay the new
pro-rata share, and all prior subscribers shall receive pro-rata refunds. At such time as there are 35
potential subscribers per mile, the subscribers shall receive their pro-rata share of construction costs. In any
event, at the end of two years from the completion of a project, the subscribers are no longer eligible for
refunds, and the amounts paid in construction costs will be credited to the plant account of the grantee.
(3) The average cost of line extension shall be recalculated annually and based upon then-current
costs for labor and materials.
(4) Subscribers utilizing the cost-sharing plan for extensions shall be reimbursed pro-rata for their
contribution or a proportional share thereof, if additional subscribers are connected to the respective
network extension.
(C) In cases of new construction or property development where utilities are to be placed underground,
the developer or property owner shall give the grantee reasonable notice of such construction or
development and of the particular date on which open trenching will be available for the grantee's
installation of conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals to be provided at the grantee's expense. The
grantee shall also provide specifications as needed for trenching. Costs of trenching and easements
required to bring service to the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner. Except for
the notice of the particular date on which trenching will be available to the grantee, any notice provided to
the grantee by the city of a preliminary plant request shall satisfy the requirement of reasonable notice if
sent to the local general manager or system engineer of the grantee prior to approval of the preliminary
plant request.

DIVISION 5 CONSERVATION
§ 16-81 DEFINITION.
The following term when used in this division, shall have the meaning ascribed to it in this
section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
WATER SHORTAGE shall be deemed to exist when the ordinary demands and requirements
of water consumers served by the city cannot be satisfied without depleting the water supply to or
below a critical level, the level at which the continued availability of water for human consumption,
sanitation, and fire protection is jeopardized. Situations also occur that can interrupt the availability of
water supply or its distribution to our customers. This Water Shortage Response Plan has been
developed to allow the City of Eden to adapt to these situations and continue to supply water to our
customer. These situations can be cause by drought, storms, water line breaks, power failures, or
harmful acts of human beings. This plan will set forth protocol for how the City of Eden Water System
will respond to these situations.

§ 16-85 MEASURES TO BE IMPLEMENTED AT VARIOUS STAGES OF WATER
CONSERVATION
Water Conservation will be encouraged at all times. The following water use habits are to be
recommended in an ongoing public information campaign to reduce wasting of water:
1) Check for leaks in toilets at least once a year by putting a few drops of food coloring in the
storage tank. If the color comes through to the toilet bowl without flushing, the toilet needs
adjustment or repair.
2) Repair leaking faucets whenever they develop.
3) Store water for drinking in the refrigerator to avoid trying to run it cool at the tap. The
storage also eliminates chlorine taste that some customers find objectionable in drinking
water.
4) Use shower for bathing or reduce the depth of water used for tub bath. Limit the length of
each shower.
5) Do not leave faucets running while shaving or rinsing dishes.
6) Install water flow restrictive devices in showerheads.
7) Install water-saving devices such as plastic bottles or commercial units in toilet tanks,
unless you already have a new water-saving type unit.
8) Always wash full loads in clothes washers and dishwashers.
9) Do not use the toilet for a trash basket; make every flush count.
10) Commercial and industrial customers should review their water uses and where feasible
install recycle systems. The savings on water and sewer bills will often pay for the
installation in a reasonable period.
The following water conservation stages, associated recommendations, and mandatory measures may
be instituted by the City Manager when a Water Shortage exists:
Stage 1 Water Supply Alert Conservation. Continue all recommendations of Continuous Water
Conservation and increase the level of conservation effort by publicizing the following measures:
1) Limit use of clothes washers and dishwashers and when used, operate fully loaded.
2) Limit flushing of toilets by multiple usages.
3) Limit lawn watering and only then, when grass shows signs of withering. Apply water as
slowly as possible to achieve deep penetration.
4) Water shrubbery the minimum required, reusing household water when possible.
5) Limit car washing to the minimum.
6) Limit wash-down of outside impervious areas such as sidewalks, patios, etc.
7) Limit hours of operation of water-cooled air conditioners if possible.
8) Limit non-essential water use for commercial and industrial activities
9) Encourage a goal of 10% reduction in water use by all customers
10) Begin 5% Water Conservation Surcharge on Customer Water Rate
28 Eden - Utilities

§ 16-89 RETURN TO NORMAL WATER SUPPLY CONDITIONS
When the Water Shortage conditions have abated and the water supply situation is returning to normal,
water conservation measures employed during the Water Supply Alert Conservation, Water Supply
Warning Conservation, Mandatory Conservation and Emergency Conservation can be decreased in the
reverse order of implementation. Permanent measures directed toward long-term monitoring and
conservation should be implemented or continued.

§ 16-90 VARIANCE FROM WATER CONSERVATION STAGES
Applications to apply for a variance from Various Water Conservation Stages are available from the
Environmental Services Director Office. Completed application will be submitted to the
Environmental Services Director’s office. Applications will be reviewed and decisions will be made
by a committee composed of the City Manager, the Environmental Services Director, and the Water
Plant Superintendent. Decisions will be final and will be granted on the following criteria:
1) Impact on the City’s Water demand
2) Essential use of drinking water
3) How long would a variance be needed
4) Does an alternative water source exist
5) Social and economical importance
6) Prevention of structural damage
(Ord. passed 5-18-10)
§ 16-91 REVIEW OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WATER CONSERVATION STAGES
The effectiveness of conservation stages will be evaluated in a timetable appropriate to the reason for
invoking the conservation stages. For example a large water main break would be evaluated hours as
to how fast elevated storage is being depleted. In a drought situation, the water source availability
would be evaluated daily versus the service water demand, to see if the conservation stages are keeping
the service water demand less than source availability.

§ 16-164 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
The City of Eden prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes without notification to and approval
by the POTW Director.
(A) Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State Hazardous Waste Authorities, in writing, of
any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous
waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set
forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous,
batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per
calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent
such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents
in the wastestream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following
twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days before the discharge
commences. The user shall not begin the discharge until receiving written approval from the City of
Eden. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste
discharge. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under § 16-160 of this
division. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by
users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of
§§ 16-156, 16-158, and 16-159 of this division.
(B) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (A), above, during a calendar month in
which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are
acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.
Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste
do not require additional notification.
(C) In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional
characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user
must notify the POTW Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and
State Hazardous Waste Authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the
effective date of such regulations.

(D) In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program
in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
(E) This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be
discharged by this division, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.

(D) The applicant shall pay the difference between the cost of the extension of services and the
percentage that will be paid by the city based upon the formulas set forth in § 16-219(B) of this code.
The tax rate for the then current fiscal year of the city shall be used in the computation of estimated
additional real property tax revenues for the specified period of years. The difference shall be paid by
the applicant prior to the extension of the water and sewer lines or the awarding of contracts for such
extension.
(E) The method of calculation of the increase in real property taxes on the property shall be as
follows:
(1) A calculation shall be made for the real property taxes that would have been ordinarily
assessed and collected on the property had it remained unimproved during the number of years
specified in § 16-219(B). The value of the unimproved property for this calculation shall be the value
of the real property for Rockingham County real property tax purposes for the year the project
commences as determined on January 1 of such year. The total amount of taxes that would have been
collected had the property remained unimproved shall be calculated by applying the then current tax
rate to the value of the unimproved property as of January 1 of the year the project commences and
multiplying the resulting amount by the appropriate number of years as specified in § 16-219(B).
(2) A calculation shall be made of the real property taxes that will be assessed and collected
on the improved property during the required number of years based upon the applicant's estimate
pursuant to § 16-219(C).
(3) Adjustment to the sum paid prior to the commencement of the project or awarding of
contracts for such project pursuant to § 16-219(D) shall be made as follows: In the event the added tax
value to the property is determined by the County Tax Department to be less than the applicant's
estimate, the applicant shall be liable to the city for the difference between the total of real property
taxes that would been payable to the city over the specified number of years and the actual taxes that
would be collected based on the county's evaluation. The applicant shall pay the difference to the city,
if any, within the 60-day period immediately following the date the County Tax Department determines
the assessment valuation of such improvements. In the event such payment is not received within the
60-day period, the city shall proceed with all remedies available to it under North Carolina law for
collection.

14 Eden - Watershed Protection
(c) 1. In addition to the development allowed under paragraphs (a) and (b) new
development and expansions may be developed under the 10/70 provisions. This means that up to 10% of
the acreage designated as protected area for the Smith River and Dan River watersheds, may be developed
with up to 70% built-upon area (impervious surface). This shall be approved on a project by project basis
subject to the provisions below.
2. Projects must, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize built-upon surface area,
direct stormwater away from surface waters and incorporate best management practices to minimize water
quality impacts. For the purpose of calculating built-upon area, total project area shall include total acreage
in the tract on which the project is to be developed.
A. Only projects within the protected area (PA) of either the Smith or Dan River
watersheds under the jurisdiction of the city of may qualify. There shall be no transfer of development
rights between the Smith and Dan River Watersheds. There shall be a maximum acreage permitted for the
Smith River Watershed Protected Area and a separate maximum for the Dan River Watershed Protected

runoff control for control of the first one inch of runoff from all built upon area.
C. No project that does not have access to public sewer shall qualify for the 10/70
provision. Approval may be granted subject to connection to public sewer provided such connection is
made within one year from the date the approval is granted. When a building permit for the site is issued or
the subdivision plat for a development is recorded, an allocation shall be assigned. Expiration of a building
permit shall terminate the allocation. If in the case of a subdivision plat a building permit is not issued
within one year from the date of recording the allocation shall be terminated. In all cases unless
construction has been initiated and is proceeding, the allocation shall be terminated after one year.
D. Allocation shall be made by the City Council upon recommendation from the
Watershed Administrator and the Planning Board. Each project shall be considered on its own merit based
upon its impact to the local economy, its impact to the city's water reclamation program, the potential level
of hazard to the water supply, soil conditions, drainage ways, slope, undisturbed areas, proximity to
waterways, and whether it is an expansion of an existing development or a new development. New
development shall receive a higher priority than expansions of existing development. The City Council may
consider any other factors that it deems relevant in its decision making.
E. No existing use that is prohibited by this article or is non-conforming to any
other city land use regulation shall be allowed to expand using the 10/70 provision.

§ 17-41 CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT.
(A) Minimum lot sizes are not applicable to single-family cluster development projects; however, the
total number of lots shall not exceed the number of lots allowed for single-family detached developments in
§ 17-40. Built-upon area or stormwater control requirements of the project shall not exceed that allowed for
the critical area or balance of watershed, whichever applies.
(B) All built-upon area shall be designed and located to minimize stormwater runoff impact to the
receiving waters and minimize concentrated stormwater flow.
(C) The remainder of the tract shall remain in a vegetated or natural state. Where the development has
an incorporated property owners association, the title of the open space area shall be conveyed to the
association for management. Where a property association is not incorporated, a maintenance agreement
shall be filed with the property deeds.
(Ord. passed 6-24-93) Penalty, see § 17-4
§ 17-42 BUFFER AREAS REQUIRED.
(A) A minimum 100-foot vegetative buffer is required for all new development activities that exceed
the low density option; otherwise, a minimum 30-foot vegetative buffer for development activities is
required along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions of U.S.G.S. 1:24,000 (7.5 minute)
scale topographic maps or as determined by local government studies. Desirable artificial streambank or
shoreline stabilization is permitted.
(B) No new development is allowed in the buffer except for water dependent structures and public
projects such as road crossings and greenways where no practical alternative exists. These activities should
minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from the surface waters and maximize the utilization
of stormwater Best Management Practices.
(Ord. passed 6-24-93) Penalty, see § 17-4
§ 17-43 RULES GOVERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF WATERSHED AREA
BOUNDARIES.
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of the watershed areas, as shown on the watershed map,
the following rules shall apply:
(A) Where area boundaries are indicated as approximately following either street, alley, railroad or
highway lines or centerlines thereof, such lines shall be construed to be said boundaries.
(B) Where area boundaries are indicated as approximately following lot lines, such lot lines shall be
construed to be said boundaries. However, a surveyed plat prepared by a registered land surveyor may be
submitted to the city as evidence that one or more properties along these boundaries do not lie within the
watershed area.
16 Eden - Watershed Protection
(C) Where the watershed area boundaries lie at scaled distance more than 25 feet from any parallel lot
line, the location of watershed area boundaries shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the
watershed map.
(D) Where the watershed area boundaries lie at a scaled distance of 25 feet or less from any parallel lot
line, the location of watershed area boundaries shall be construed to be the lot line.
(E) Where other uncertainty exists, the Watershed Administrator shall interpret the watershed map as
to location of such boundaries. This decision may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.
(Ord. passed 6-24-93)

§ 17-74 ESTABLISHMENT OF WATERSHED REVIEW BOARD.
The Board of Adjustment is hereby established as the Watershed Review Board.
(Ord. passed 6-24-93)
§ 17-75 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
(A) Administrative review. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from any decision
or determination made by the Watershed Administrator in the enforcement of this chapter.
(B) Variances. The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to authorize, in specific cases, minor
variances from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interests where, owing to
special conditions, a literal enforcement of this chapter will result in practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardship, so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and
substantial justice done. In addition, the city shall give notice of the pending variance to all other local
governments having jurisdiction in and all other entities obtaining water from the designated watershed
where the variance is being considered and the city shall allow a reasonable comment period for all such
local governments and entities.
(1) Applications for a variance shall be made on the proper form obtainable from the Watershed
Administrator and shall include the following information:
(a) A site plan, drawn to a scale of at least one inch to 40 feet, indicating the property lines of
the parcel upon which the use is proposed; any existing or proposed structures; parking areas and other
built-upon areas; surface water drainage. The site plan shall be neatly drawn and indicate north point, name
and address of person who prepared the plan, date of the original drawing, and an accurate record of any
later revisions.
(b) A complete and detailed description of the proposed variance, together with any other
pertinent information which the applicant feels would be helpful to the Board of Adjustment in considering
the application.
(c) The Watershed Administrator shall notify in writing each local government having
jurisdiction in the watershed. Such notice shall include a description of the variance being requested. Local
governments receiving notice of the variance request may submit comments to the Watershed
24 Eden - Watershed Protection
Administrator prior to a decision by the Board of Adjustment. Such comments shall become a part of the
record of proceedings of the Board of Adjustment.
(2) Before the Board of Adjustment may grant a variance, it shall make the following three
findings, which shall be recorded in the permanent record of the case, and shall include the factual reasons
on which they are based:
(a) There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the
strict letter of the chapter. In order to determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardships, the Board must find that the five following conditions exist:
1. If he complies with the provisions of the chapter, the applicant can secure no
reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, his property. Merely proving that the variance would
permit a greater profit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the Board in
granting a variance. Moreover, the Board shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible
deviation from the terms of the chapter that will make possible the reasonable use of his property.
2. The hardship results from the application of the chapter to the property rather than
from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship.
3. The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its size,
shape, or topography, which is different from that of neighboring property.
4. The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or
unknowingly violates the chapter, or who purchases the property after the effective date of the chapter, and
then comes to the Board for relief.
5. The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather than the result of
conditions that are widespread. If other properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the
restriction, then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others, and would not promote
equal justice.
(b) The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the chapter and
preserves its spirit.
(c) In the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured and
substantial justice has been done. The Board shall not grant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any
respect impair the public health, safety, or general welfare.
(3) In granting the variance, the Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location,
character, and other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as it may deem advisable in
furtherance of the purpose of this chapter. If a variance for the construction, alteration or use of property is
granted, such construction, alteration or use shall be in accordance with the approved site plan.
Administration, Enforcement and Appeals 25
(4) The Board of Adjustment shall refuse to hear an appeal or an application for a variance
previously denied if it finds that there have been no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances
bearing on the appeal or application.
(5) A variance issued in accordance with this section shall be considered a watershed protection
permit and shall expire if a building permit or watershed occupancy permit for such use is not obtained by
the applicant within six months from the date of the decision.
(6) If the application calls for the granting of a major variance, and if the Board of Adjustment
decides in favor of granting the variance, the Board shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing with
all deliberate speed. The preliminary record of the hearing shall include:

GENERAL PROVISIONS
An Ordinance Establishing Zoning Regulations For the City Of Eden And Its Extraterritorial Zoning Area And Providing For the Administration, Enforcement, And Amendment Thereof And Creating A Board Of Adjustment In Accordance With The Statutes Of North Carolina Governing Municipal Zoning.
SECTION 11.21 PURPOSE, AUTHORITY, JURISDICTION AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE
(a) Purpose - The zoning regulations and districts as herein set forth have been made in accordance with a comprehensive plan and designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewage, schools, parks and other public requirements.

SECTION 11.22 GENERAL PROVISIONS
3
The regulations set forth in this Ordinance affect all land, every building and every use of land and/or building, and shall apply as follows:
(a) New Uses or Construction - After the effective date of this Ordinance, all new construction or use of land or structures shall conform to the use and dimensional requirements for the district in which it is to be located.
(b) Conforming Uses - After the effective date of this Ordinance, land or structures, or the uses of land or structures which conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located may be continued, provided that any structural alteration or change in use shall conform with the regulations herein specified.
(c) Nonconforming Uses - After the effective date of this Ordinance, pre-existing land or structures, or uses of land or structures which would be prohibited under the regulations for the district in which it is located, shall be considered as nonconforming. Nonconforming structures or uses may be continued provided they conform to the following provisions:
(1) Minimum Single Lot Requirements -Where the owner of a lot at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance or his successor in title thereto does not own sufficient land to enable him to conform to the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance, such lot may be used as a building site for a single-family residence in a district in which residences are permitted; provided that the minimum side and front yard requirements set out in this Ordinance for the district in which the residence is located are conformed to; and provided further that any permitted use serviced by a private septic tank system shall have a minimum lot area of not less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet.
(2) Minimum Multi-Lot Requirements -Where there exists two (2) or more adjoining lots under single ownership with dimensions smaller than that required in the zoning district in which they are located, such lots shall be considered as a single lot or several lots which meet the minimum requirements of this Ordinance for the district in which such lots are located. The area dimensional requirements of this Ordinance shall not apply to two (2) or more adjoining lots in a single ownership provided 1/ the subdivision was recorded by the Rockingham County Registrar of Deeds prior to July 16, 1968; and 2/ that the proposed permitted uses are to be connected to the principal sewer system. If the proposed permitted uses are to be serviced by a septic tank system, the parcels shall be resubdivided with each lot having no less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet.
(3) Extension of Nonconforming Uses - Nonconforming uses shall not hereafter be enlarged or extended in any way.
(4) Change of Nonconforming Uses - Any nonconforming use may be changed to any con-forming use, or with the approval of the Board of Adjustment, to any use more in character with the uses permitted in the district. In permitting such change, the Board of Adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(5) Cessation of Nonconforming Uses - If active operations of a nonconforming use are discontinued for a continuous period of six (6) months, such nonconforming use shall thereafter be used only for a conforming use.
(6) Repair and Alteration of Nonconforming Uses - Normal maintenance and repair in a building occupied by a nonconforming use is permitted provided it does not extend the nonconforming use.
SECTION 11.22 GENERAL PROVISIONS
4
(7) Damage or Destruction of Nonconforming Uses - Any nonconforming use, other than a single-family detached structure as described in paragraph (10) below, which has been damaged by fire or other causes, may be repaired and used as before, unless such building or structure has been declared by the Zoning Administrator to have been damaged to an extent exceeding sixty (60) percent of its assessed value at the time of destruction. If the building is damaged to a degree greater than sixty (60) percent, future use of the building and site must be in conformance with the zoning district regulations for the area.
(8) Nonconforming Manufactured Home Parks - Existing manufactured home parks at the effective date of this ordinance, that do not meet all of the standards for such use that are set forth elsewhere in this ordinance, shall be considered nonconforming. Such uses shall not expand in any way beyond the existing developed areas, but shall be allowed to remove and replace the units on spaces existing within the existing park, provided that the total number of units does not exceed the number existing at the effective date of this ordinance and provided that the existing waste treatment system is functioning properly.
(9) Temporary Nonconforming Uses of Land - Temporary nonconforming uses of land for carnivals, manufactured homes, and similar uses may be permitted according to the provisions of Section 11.28, (b), (1).
(10) Single-Family Detached Structures May Be Enlarged or Replaced - Any single-family residential detached structure used for residential purposes that is the sole principal use of land and is maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure or one of a larger size. The nonconforming structure may be repaired or replaced regardless of the extent of the damage that the original structure may or may not have received. Provided however, that the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to such matters as minimum yard and parking requirements.
(11) In residential districts where a lot is devoted to a residential use permitted in the residential district and is situated between two (2) adjoining lots, each of which a principal residential building located on the lot, then the front and side and rear yard requirements of the principal structure may be modified. The front, side or rear yards of the principal residential structure to be erected or remodeled shall be determined by either (i) averaging the front, side or rear yards of the adjoining lots, or (ii) making the front, side or rear setbacks the same as one of the adjoining lots. If one of the adjoining sides is vacant, then the setbacks will be averaged based upon all principal residential structures on the same side of the street of the block in which the proposed development is to take place. No proposed building may be less than twenty (20) feet from the street right-of-way line of the front of the principal structure. No side yard setback shall be less than five (5) feet in any circumstances. No rear yard shall be less than ten (10) feet in any circumstances.
(d) Open Space Requirements - No part of a yard, court or other open space provided around any building or structure for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this Ordinance shall be included as part of a yard or other open space required under this Ordinance for another building or structure. Every part of a required yard shall be open and unobstructed from its lowest level to the sky, except for the ordinary projection of sills, chimneys, flues, buttresses, ornamental features, and eaves; provided, however, that none of the aforesaid projections shall project into a minimum side yard more than one-third (1/3) of the width of such yard nor more than twenty-four (24) inches whichever is the least. Open or lattice enclosed fire escapes, fire proof outside stairways, and balconies opening upon fire towers projecting into a yard not more than five (5) feet shall be permitted where placed so as not to obstruct light and ventilation.

5
(e) Reduction of Lot and Yard Areas Prohibited - No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this Ordinance shall be reduced in size or area below the minimum requirements set forth in this Ordinance. Yards or lots created after the effective date of this Ordinance shall meet at last the minimum requirements established by this Ordinance.
(f) Public Access to Property - Every building or structure hereafter erected shall be located on a lot and said lot shall abut a public street, highway, road or other public way.
(1) Flag Lots shall meet the following requirements:
(2) A flag lot shall contain only one (1) single family dwelling and its uninhabited accessory structures.
(3) The maximum flagpole length shall be three hundred (300) feet.
(4) The minimum flagpole width shall be twenty-five (25) feet.
(5) The flagpole portion of the lot shall not be used to calculate area, width, depth, coverage, and setbacks of the lot.
(6) Where public water is available, any building on the flag lot must be within five hundred (500) feet of a fire hydrant. The distance shall be measured along the street, then in a straight line to the building location.
(7) Where public sewer is available, occupied buildings on the flag shall have a gravity service line or the sewer pump requirement shall be noted on the plat.
(8) The use of a single driveway to serve adjoining flag lots or to serve a flag lot and an adjoining conventional lot is permitted and encouraged.
(9) The plats recorded for flag lots shall contain a notation that the City of Eden will provide sanitation services only on the dedicated right-of-way. City service vehicles except in emergencies will not travel on the flag pole portion of the lot.
(g) Projection Into Public Streets and Street Rights-of-Way - No signs, or other structures shall project beyond any curb line of any street or if no curb exists, within ten (10) feet of the traveled portion of the right-of-way.
(h) Group Housing Developments - Group housing developments as defined in the definition section of this Ordinance are permitted only in the zoning districts where group housing developments are listed as a permitted use.
(i) Interpretation of District Boundaries - When uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
(1) Delineation - District boundary lines are generally intended to be along or parallel to property lines, lot lines, the center line of streets, alleys, railroads, easements, other rights-of-way, and creeks, streams, or other water channels. In the absence of specified distances on the map, dimensions or districts shall be determined by scaling the distance on the Official Zoning Map.
SECTION 11.22 GENERAL PROVISIONS

(2) Zoning Board of Adjustment -When the street or property layout existing on the ground is at variance with that shown on the Official Zoning Map, the Board of Adjustment shall interpret the district boundaries of this Ordinance.
(j) Interpretation of Regulations - Regulations of this Ordinance shall be enforced and interpreted according to the following rules:
(1) Permitted Uses - Uses not designated as permitted uses shall be prohibited. Additional uses, when in character with the district, may be added to the Ordinance by amendment. When a use is permitted in a certain district or districts, it is the general intent of this Ordinance that, upon creation or designation of that district, such permitted use is in harmony with the area and in general conformity with the plan of development of Eden and its environs.
(2) Minimum Requirements - The provisions of this Ordinance shall be considered minimum requirements for the promotion of the public safety, health, and the general welfare. When there is inconsistency between provisions in this Ordinance and state and federal regulations, the stricter requirement shall apply.
(k) Conflict With Other Regulations - It is not intended by this Ordinance to interfere with, abrogate or annul any easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties, provided, however, that where this Ordinance imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or premises or upon the height of buildings, or required larger open spaces than are imposed or required by other ordinances, rules, regulations or by easements, covenants, or agreements, the provisions of this Ordinance shall govern.
(l) Severability of Ordinance - If for any reason one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or parts of this Ordinance are held invalid by the Courts, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remaining provisions of this Ordinance. The City Council hereby declares that it would have passed this Ordinance and each section, subsection, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared invalid.
(m) Remedies - In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building, structure, or land is used in violation of this Ordinance, the Building Inspector or any appropriate authority of the City or any adjacent, nearby or neighboring property owner who would be affected by such violation in addition to other remedies may institute injunction, mandamus or other appropriate action in proceeding to prevent the occupancy of such building, structure or land.
(n) Penalties for Violating Any Provision of This Ordinance - Any person, firm or corporation violating any provision of this Ordinance, or who shall violate or fail to comply with any order made thereunder; or who shall continue to work upon any structure after having received written notice from the Building Inspector to cease work shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punishable by a fine not to exceed fifty ($50) dollars or imprisoned not exceeding thirty (30) days. Each day such violation shall be permitted to exist shall constitute a separate offense. Notice of violation shall be sufficient if directed to such owner, the agent of the owner or the contractor and left at his known place of residence or place of business.

(4) If an opinion is received from the city attorney that a member has an impermissible conflict of interest pursuant to a particular decision or set of facts and the member does not disqualify himself or herself, the board may by majority vote (not considering the vote of the member with the alleged conflict) disqualify that member from all participation in the matter involved.
(d) No board member shall vote on any matter that decides an application or appeal unless he has attended the public hearing on that application or appeal.
(e) No board member shall discuss any case with any parties thereto before the hearing on that case; provided, however, that members may receive and/or seek information pertaining to the case from any member of the board or its administrative assistant before the hearing.

The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.

Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this section shall not be required to meet the requirements of this section except for all Federal Regulations relating to this subject and the North Carolina State Building Code.
(2) General Guidelines.
(a) Principal or Accessory Use. Antennas and towers may be considered principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of a tower or antenna provided that it complies with district regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed and antennas that are installed in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
(b) Inventory of Existing Sites. Each applicant for an administrative or a special use permit shall provide to the Planning and Inspections Department an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the City of Eden or within one-quarter (1/4) mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height and design of each tower.

(3) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment may be of a neutral color that is identical to or closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(4) Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the Board of Adjustment may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
(3) Federal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Changes to the height and lighting requirements would require additional review by the Board of Adjustment. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner’s expense.
(4) Building Codes; Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable state and local building codes and the applicable standards for

(a) Wireless Towers in the City of Eden Planning Jurisdiction must be setback a distance equal to the height of the tower from any property line. To encourage the construction of monopole structures, monopole towers may have a 20 percent reduction in the required setbacks. In no case shall the tower be constructed any closer to the property line than the setback requirements as set forth in the underlying zoning district. Said setback reductions shall only be allowed upon a professional engineering certification which states that the structure’s construction will cause the tower to crumble inward so that in the event of collapse no damage to structures on adjacent lots will result.
(b) Attached Antennas. Attached antennas shall meet the setback provisions of the underlying zoning district in which they are located. However, an attached antenna may extend up to 30 inches horizontally beyond the edge of the attachment structure so long as the antenna does not encroach upon an adjoining parcel.

(4) Preexisting Towers and Antennas. Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this section shall not be required to meet the requirements of this section except for all Federal Regulations relating to this subject and the North Carolina State Building Code.
(b) General Guidelines.
(1) Principal or Accessory Use. Antennas and towers may be considered principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of a tower or antenna provided that it complies with district regulation, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements. The dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed and antennas that are installed in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
(2) Inventory of Existing Sites. Each applicant for an administrative or a special use permit shall provide to the Planning and Inspections Department an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the City of Eden or within one-quarter (1/4) mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height and design of each tower. Applicants are encouraged to submit an inventory of potential future tower sites within the jurisdiction of the City of Eden. The Planning and Inspections Department may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits under this ordinance or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction; provided, however, that the department is not, by sharing such information in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable.

(c) Aesthetics; Lighting. The provisions set out in this section shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this ordinance.
(1) Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or be subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2) At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall to the extent possible use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
(3) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to or closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(4) Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the Board of Adjustment may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
(d) Federal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Changes to the height or lighting requirements would require additional review by the Board of Adjustment. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner’s expense.
(e) Building Codes; Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable state and local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If upon inspection by the City of Eden Planning and Inspections Department, it is concluded that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to person or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the City of Eden shall revoke or not issue a certificate of occupancy and either not permit power to such facility

(1) Tower Facilities in the City of Eden Planning Jurisdiction must be setback a distance equal to the height of the tower from any property line. To encourage the construction of monopole structures, monopole towers may have a 20 percent reduction in the required setbacks. In no case shall the tower be constructed any closer to the property line than the setback requirements as set forth in the underlying zoning district. Said setback reductions shall only be allowed upon a professional engineering certification which states that the structure’s construction will cause the tower to crumble inward so that in the event of collapse no damage to structures on adjacent lots will result.
(2) Attached Antennas. Attached antennas will meet the setback provisions of the underlying zoning district in which they are located. However an attached antenna may extend up to 30 inches horizontally beyond the edge of the attachment structure so long as the antenna does not encroach upon an adjoining parcel.

In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer. Vegetation that causes interferences with antennas or inhibits access to tower facility may be trimmed or removed.
(q) Existing Vegetation. Existing vegetation on a tower facility site may be used in lieu of required landscaping where approved by the Zoning Administrator.
(r) Minimum Site Disturbance. Grading for the new Wireless Communication Facility shall be minimized and limited only to the area necessary for the new facility.
(s) Signs. No signs or logos, for which sign permits are required by this ordinance shall be allowed on any tower, antenna or related device.
(t) Parking. Wireless Communication Facilities shall have a minimum of two (2) off-street parking spaces.
(u) Removal of Abandoned Wireless Communication Facilities. Any Wireless Communication Facility that is not operated as a commercial wireless communication site or by a government agency or by an emergency service provider, for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned and the owner of such facility shall remove the same within 60 days of the notice thereof. Applicants to construct any such facility shall provide a performance bond for the cost of the removal of such facility in favor of the City of Eden.

Such fee shall be established by the City Council.
(b) ACTION BY THE PLANNING BOARD – The following action shall be taken by the Planning Board.
(1) Planning Board Consideration – Subsequent to initial adoption of a Zoning Ordinance, all proposed amendments to the Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Map shall be submitted to the Planning Board for review and comment. If no written report is received from the Planning Board within thirty (30) days of referral of the amendment to the Board, the City Council may proceed in its consideration of the amendment without the Planning Board report. The City Council is not bound by the recommendations, if any, of the Planning Board.
The Planning Board may hold separate public hearings or may sit concurrently with the public hearing held by the City Council.
(2) Planning Board Statement – The Planning Board shall advise and comment on whether the proposed amendment is consistent with any comprehensive plan that has been adopted and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable. The Planning Board shall provide a written recommendation to the City Council that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate by the Planning Board, but a comment by the Planning Board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the City Council.

25 days before the date fixed for the public hearing. In computing such period, the date of publication is not to be included but the day of the hearing shall be included. Notice may also be made by posting the property or mailing notices to the owners of the surrounding property.
When a Zoning Map amendment is proposed, the city shall prominently post a notice of the public hearing on the site proposed for rezoning or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way. When multiple parcels are included within a Zoning Map amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is not required, but the city shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to interested persons.
In the event that either the Planning Board or the City Council should decide to amend a map amendment request to include additional parcels of land, notices shall be sent certified mail with a return receipt requested to those property owners whose property would be added to the map amendment request and subject to being rezoned.
The first class mail notice shall not be required if the Zoning Map amendment directly affects more than fifty (50) properties, owned by a total of at least fifty (50) different property owners, and the city elects to use the expanded published notice provided for in this subsection. In this instance, the city may elect to either make the mailed notice or may, as an alternative, elect to publish notice of the hearing, but provided that each advertisement shall not be less than one-half of a newspaper page in size. The advertisement shall only be effective for property owners who reside in the area of general circulation of the newspaper which publishes the notice. Property owners who reside outside of the newspaper circulation area, according to the address listed on the most recent property tax listing for the affected property, shall be notified by first class mail.
(2) City Council Action – Before taking such lawful action as it may seem advisable, the City Council shall consider the Planning Board’s recommendation on each proposed Zoning Amendment. If no written report is received from the Planning Board within thirty (30) days of referral of the amendment to the Board, the petitioner may take the proposal to the Council without a recommendation from the Board and the City Council may proceed in its consideration of the amendment without the Planning Board report. The City Council, at the close of the public hearing may defer taking lawful action on the proposed amendment until it has sufficient time to consider any new evidence or suggestions presented at the public hearing. The City Council may approve or deny the amendment or approve a more restrictive zoning district. The City Council is not bound by the recommendations, if any, of the Planning Board.
No City Council member shall vote on any Zoning Map or text amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the member.
Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the City Council shall adopt a statement describing whether its action is consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan and explaining why the Council considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest.
(3) Protests – In case of a qualified protest against a Zoning Map amendment, that amendment shall not become effective except by favorable vote of three-fourths of all the members of the City Council. For the purposes of this section, vacant positions on the Council and members who are excused from voting shall not be considered ‘members of the Council’ for calculation of the requisite supermajority.

To qualify as a protest under this section, the petition must be signed by the owners of either (i) twenty percent (20%) or more of the area included in the proposed change or (ii) five percent (5%) of a 100 foot wide buffer extending along the entire boundary of each discrete or separate area proposed to be rezoned. A street right-of-way shall not be considered in computing the 100 foot buffer area as long as the street right-of-way is 100 feet wide or less. When less than an entire parcel of land is subject to the proposed Zoning Map amendment, the 100 foot buffer shall be measured from the property line of that parcel. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the city may rely on the county tax listing to determine the owners of potentially qualifying areas.
No protest against any change in or amendment to the Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Map shall be valid or effective unless it be in the form of a written petition actually bearing the signatures of the requisite number of property owners and stating that the signers do protest the proposed change or amendment, and unless it shall have been received by the City Clerk in sufficient time to allow the city at least two normal work days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, before the date established for a public hearing on the proposed change or amendment to determine the sufficiency and accuracy of the petition. The City Council may by ordinance require that all protest petitions be on a form prescribed and furnished by the city, and such form may prescribe any reasonable information deemed necessary to permit the city to determine the sufficiency and accuracy of the petition. A person who has signed a protest petition may withdraw his or her name from the petition at any time prior to the vote on the proposed zoning amendment. Only those protest petitions that meet the qualifying standards at the time of the vote on the zoning amendment shall trigger the supermajority voting requirement.
The foregoing provisions concerning protests shall not be applicable to any amendment which initially zones property added to the territorial coverage of the ordinance as a result of annexation or otherwise, or to an amendment to an adopted (i) special use district, (ii) conditional use district, or (iii) conditional district if the amendment does not change the types of uses that are permitted within the district or increase the approved density for residential development, or increase the total approved size of nonresidential development, or reduce the size of any buffers or screening approved for the special use district, conditional use district or conditional district.

(2) A second application for rezoning to a different district on the same property may be filed within a one (1) year period from final action on the initial application.
(3) No more than two (2) rezoning applications shall be filed for a given property within any one (1) year period.

ARTICLE 1. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
SECTION A. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
Municipal: The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3, 5, and 8 of Article 19 of Chapter 160A; and Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental the responsibility units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Council of the City of Eden, North Carolina, does ordain as follows:
SECTION B. FINDINGS OF FACT.
(1) The flood prone areas within the planning jurisdiction of the City of Eden are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
SECTION C. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
(1) restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
(2) require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3) control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4) control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and
(5) prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
SECTION D. OBJECTIVES.
The objectives of this ordinance are:
(1) to protect human life and health;
(2) to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE
328
(3) to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4) to minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
(5) to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;
(6) to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas; and
(7) to ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area.

SECTION 11.31 SIGNS
(a) PURPOSE
The purpose of this chapter is to establish regulations and standards for the construction, maintenance, and removal of signs. The City of Eden, under the zoning authority granted to the City, desires to regulate signs within the planning jurisdiction in order to accomplish the following objectives:
(1) To promote the general health, safety and welfare by removing distracting signs not needed to identify a business location;
(2) To protect the public investment in the creation, maintenance, safety and appearance of its streets and highways;
(3) To create a more attractive environment for tourists and business interests in the locality;
(4) To preserve and increase the value of commercial and residential buildings in the area by creating a more visually harmonious environment; and
(5) To identify on-premise business sites.
(b) APPLICABILITY
A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created, or maintained in the planning jurisdiction only in conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions, and other requirements of this ordinance.
(c) PERMITS REQUIRED
Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7 (Signs Exempt) and subsection 8 (Signs That Do Not Require a Permit) of this chapter, no sign shall be erected, moved, enlarged, or substantially altered except in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance.
Signs may be erected, moved, enlarged, or substantially altered only in accordance with a sign permit issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer. Such permit applications and permits shall be governed by the same provisions of this ordinance applicable to development permits.
(d) COMPUTATIONS
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sight height:
(1) Sign Area
The area of a sign shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets other applicable ordinance requirements and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
(2) Multi-faced Sign Area
SIGNS
356
The sign area for a sign with more than one (1) face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from one (1) point. When two (2) identical sign faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one (1) of the faces.
(3) Height
The height of a sign, or portion thereof, erected within 30 feet of a street right-of-way shall be computed as the distance from the nearest adjacent street grade to which the sign is oriented and on which the lot has frontage to the top of the highest component of the sign or sign structure. The height of all signs erected farther than 30 feet from a street right-of-way shall be the distance from the finished grade level where the sign is erected to the top of the sign or sign structure. Finished grade shall be the grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for he purpose of locating the sign.
(4) Lots with Multi-frontage
Lots fronting on two (2) or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street lot frontage. However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot’s total sign area allocation that is derived from the street frontage.
(e) SIGNS PROHIBITED

(1) Abandoned signs.

(8) Signs on vehicles or trailers that are parked in a location which is visible to the public and for a period of time which indicates that the principal use of the vehicle or trailer is for advertising rather than transport.

373
SECTION 11.32 WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES. Wireless Communication Facilities shall be permitted in all zoning districts provided the use meets all of the requirements of this ordinance for the district in which such proposed tower is located. This section is designed to encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas and to minimize the total number of towers in the jurisdiction, to encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites, to encourage the location, design and erection of such towers, to the extent possible, where the impact on the community is minimal and to enhance the ability of service providers of the wireless communication industry to provide quality service to the jurisdiction.
(1) District Height Limitations. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location of towers, and antennas that are installed at a height in excess of, the height limitations specified for each district.
(2) Public Property. Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the City of Eden shall be exempt from the requirements of this ordinance, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the Eden City Council.
(3) Amateur Radio. This section shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that complies with the height requirement for the district in which it is located and is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator.
(4) Preexisting Towers and Antennas. Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this section shall not be required to meet the requirements of this section except for all Federal Regulations relating to this subject and the North Carolina State Building Code.
(5) General Guidelines.
(a) Principal or Accessory Use. Antennas and towers may be considered principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of a tower or antenna provided that it complies with district regulations, including but not limited to set-back requirements, lot coverage requirements and other such requirements. The dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots.
(b) Inventory of Existing Sites. Each applicant for an administrative or special use permit shall provide to the Planning and Inspections Department an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the City of Eden or within one-quarter (1/4) mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height and design of each tower.

(2) At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall to the extent possible use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
(3) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to or closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(4) Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the Board of Adjustment may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
(6) Federal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Changes to the height or lighting requirements would require additional review by the Board of Adjustment. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner’s expense.
(7) Building Codes; Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable state and local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If upon inspection by the City of Eden Planning and Inspections Department, it is concluded that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to person or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the City of Eden shall revoke or not issue a certificate of occupancy and either not permit power to such facility or discontinue power to the facility until such time as the deficiencies are deemed corrected.
(8) Coverage Need. Need of coverage shall be demonstrated by the wireless provider.
(9) Land Form Preservation. Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer. Vegetation that causes interference with antennas or inhibits access to tower facility may be trimmed or removed. Provided however, no tree may be trimmed or removed on property owned by the City of Eden without a review by the City of Eden Tree Board.
(10) Existing Vegetation. Existing vegetation on a tower facility site may be used in lieu of required landscaping where approved by the Zoning Administrator.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
389
SECTION 11.34 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
Development activities tend to increase the volume of stormwater runoff due to the elimination of pervious surfaces through paving and the construction of buildings and other structures. Stormwater runoff impacts the public health, safety and welfare by flooding private and public property, by discharging pollutants, such as oils and greases, into receiving water bodies, and by making public streets and roads unsafe. Therefore, applicants for development authorization in which the total impervious surface will exceed 20,000 square feet, shall not be entitled to a zoning compliance permit until such time as the applicant has submitted a stormwater management plan demonstrating compliance with this section.
(1) PLAN PROTECTION
The stormwater management plan shall be prepared, signed and sealed by a registered or licensed North Carolina professional with qualifications appropriate for the type of system required and to the degree they are permitted to do so under the law.
(2) CONCEPTUAL STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN
The Purpose of a conceptual stormwater management plan is to demonstrate the likelihood that a development undergoing site plan review or special use review will meet the standards for stormwater management contained in this section. When a conceptual stormwater management plan is required, the following requirements shall apply:
(a) The plan shall show the location of proposed improvements, shall only include stormwater related features, and shall not be shown on any other plan such as a site plan, an erosion control plan, or a landscape plan.
(b) Calculations, including all assumptions of the pre- and post-development stormwater runoff rate in cubic feet per second generated by the peak runoff from a ten-year storm.
(c) Identification of drainage areas.
(d) A general layout of stormwater drainage features within the development.
(e) If applicable, a statement describing the feature or features proposed to limit the post development stormwater runoff rate to the pre-development stormwater runoff rate, and the proposed location and size of feature(s).
(f) Location of the point(s) of discharge of the stormwater system.
(g) Location of connection(s) to the City stormwater sewer system, if applicable.
If in the opinion of the City Engineer, the conceptual stormwater management plan does not adequately address the requirements of the stormwater resolution, additional information may be required.
(3) CONTENTS OF FINAL STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN
Final stormwater management plans shall contain the following elements:
(a) A plan showing all pre- and post-development features with (1) a table listing and describing each feature and whether or not it is impervious, (2) each feature’s area in square feet or acres and the percent each feature represents of the total area, and (3) identification and delineation of all drainage areas and point(s) of discharge of the stormwater system. This
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
390
plan shall be drawn in a suitable east to read scale and shall be a separate document and not part of any other plan.
(b) Topographic contours or spot elevations for all pre- and post-development areas. Topographic contours or spot elevations shall clearly show pre- and post-development drainage patterns.
(c) Calculations showing the pre- and post-development rate of stormwater runoff in cubic-feet-per second generated by the peak runoff rate from a ten-year storm.
(d) Details of proposed stormwater drainage structures, infiltration areas, retention ponds or detention ponds including as appropriate pertinent elevations, sections, outlet details, area capacity curves, identifying labels, and other information as required by the City Engineer.
(e) Details and logical calculations and tables showing all design assumptions, methods of analysis, the pre- and post-development runoff qualities, capacities of proposed structures, slopes, sizes, identifying labels, and other information as required by the City Engineer.
(4) STANDARDS FOR REVIEW
Unless the applicant has been approved to discharge stormwater runoff into an existing City stormwater runoff into an existing City stormwater facility with sufficient capacity to accommodate increased flows attributable to the proposed development as provided below, the stormwater management plan shall be designed so that the post-development rate of stormwater runoff, shall not exceed the pre-development rate of stormwater runoff. The stormwater management plan may propose retention either on-site or off-site or by means of a combination of on-site and off-site. If any or all of the stormwater from a design storm is proposed to be retained off-site, such shall be done only under express terms of a recorded easement.
(5) DISCHARGE INTO CITY STORMWATER FACILITY
An applicant may request authorization to discharge stormwater runoff from a proposed development into an existing City stormwater facility. Upon determination that there is sufficient capacity in the City stormwater facility to accommodate the runoff associated with the proposed development, as well as existing and other anticipated runoff, the City Manager, or his designee, may authorize the applicant to discharge into the City facility. All costs associated with such discharge, including installation of necessary storm sewers, shall be borne by the applicant.
(6) INSTALLATION OF STORMWATER SYSTEM
The stormwater system shall be installed in substantial conformity with the plans. If there are significant deviations from the design, a revised plan showing the deviations shall be submitted in time to permit the review and approval of the plans before any construction work affected by such deviations is begun. Upon completion of construction, a registered professional appropriate for appropriate for the type of stormwater system designed must certify in writing to the City Engineer that the system was inspected during construction and was constructed in substantial conformity with the approved plans, and shall submit a suitable plan clearly marked “As-Built” showing the system as constructed. No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued until these requirements are met and the as-built plan has been approved. If a development has been approved for construction in phases, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be requested for each phase as long as all other requirements are met. The as-built plan described above will be required at the completion of all phases.

391
(7) MAINTENANCE OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES
The owner of a stormwater management facility shall be responsible for maintenance of that facility unless the City accepts maintenance as provided below. This responsibility shall be noted on the final plat and deeds for any affected lots.
Any detention or retention facilities approved under this ordinance shall be subject to inspection by the City Engineer at least annually and the owner shall pay an annual inspection fee the amount of which shall be determined by resolution of City Council. The owner shall correct any deficiencies within 30 calendar days of written notification thereof. Failure to correct deficiencies or to pay the annual inspection fee shall constitute a violation of this ordinance.
Whenever an existing or future private stormwater management facility is proposed to serve a development undergoing site plan or special use review, the following shall be provided the Zoning Administrator prior to issued of a certificate of occupancy.
(a) A written inspection and maintenance agreement in a form acceptable to the City Attorney and executed by the applicant and the owners of the facility, which shall bind the parties thereto and all subsequent owners, successors and assigns, and provide for the following:
(i) The maintenance of the facility. If a party other than the applicant assumes primary responsibility for the maintenance of the facility, the applicant shall guarantee the maintenance of the facility and assume ultimate responsibility thereof.
(ii) Access to the facility at reasonable times for inspection by the City and/or its agents or representatives.
(iii) That if an order directing the correction, repair, replacement, or maintenance of the facility or of any portion thereof is not satisfactorily complied with within a reasonable period of time, as deemed appropriate by the City Engineer, the City may, after notice to the owner, enter the land and perform all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition, and may assess the owners of the subject property with the cost of said work, which cost shall be a lien on such property and may be collected as provided in NCGS Section 160A-193. Notice shall be provided five (5) calendar days prior to entry and performance of necessary work by the City. Notice shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the owner by hand-delivery, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any other means allowed by Rule 4 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.
The owners of all property served by the facility shall be jointly and severally responsible to the City for the maintenance of the facility and liable for any costs incurred by the City pursuant to said agreement, and all such properties are jointly and severally subject to the imposition of liens for said costs.
