PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Apex, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2004 Code, as supplemented through April 19, 2011, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2004 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SRT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indices which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This republication was under the direct supervision of Dennis Sinnett, Vice President, Supplement Department, and Regina Sosinski, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Donna B. Hosch, Town Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

Sec. 2. The purpose of this act is to revise the charter of the Town of Apex and to consolidate herein certain acts concerning the property, affairs and government of the Town.

Sec. 8. If any provisions of this act or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this act which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this act are declared to be severable. 
Sec. 9.

Sec. 2.6. - Ordinances and resolutions. 
(a)  Generally. The adoption, amendment, repeal, pleading or proving of Town ordinances and resolutions shall be in accordance with applicable provisions of the General Statutes of North Carolina not inconsistent with this charter. Except as otherwise provided by law, all ordinances shall become effective upon adoption; provided, an ordinance may, by its own terms, specify some other time upon which it shall take effect. The enacting clause of all Town ordinances shall be: "Be it ordained by the Town Council of the Town of Apex." 
(b)  Platting of proposed street lines. From and after the time of adoption of a major street plan by the Town Council and the Department of Transportation pursuant to provisions of General Statutes section 136-66.2, the Town Council shall have power to request, make, or cause to be made, from time to time, surveys for the exact locating of the lines of new, extended, widened or narrowed streets and highways in the whole or any portion of the Town and the area within its outside zoning and subdivision control jurisdiction. Personnel making such surveys are empowered to enter upon lands, make examinations or surveys, and place and maintain necessary monuments thereon, at reasonable times and with due care for the property. A plat or plats of the area or areas thus surveyed shall be prepared on which are indicated the locations of the lines recommended as the planned or mapped lines of future streets, street extensions, street widenings, or street narrowings. The preparation of such plat or plats shall not in and of itself constitute or be deemed to constitute the opening or establishment of any streets or the taking or acceptance of any land for street purposes. 
(c)  Adoption of official map; hearing; notice. Following the preparation of such plats, the Town Council may officially adopt a map or maps of planned new streets and highways, extensions, widenings, narrowings, or vacations of streets within the Town and the territory within its extraterritorial zoning and subdivision control jurisdiction. Before taking any such action, the Town Council shall hold a public hearing thereon, notice of the time and place of which shall have been given once a week for two (2) successive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the Town and by posting such notice at four (4) public places in the Town and at four (4) public places within the affected area outside the corporate boundaries. Such notice shall be published or posted for the first time not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the date fixed for said hearing. Following adoption of such map or maps the Town Council shall certify a copy to the Register of Deeds of Wake County, which copy shall be duly filed. The placing of any street or street line upon any official map or maps shall not in and of itself constitute or be deemed to constitute the opening or establishment of any street or the taking or acceptance of any land for street purposes. 
(d)  Right of Town to acquire property before improvement. From and after the time of adoption and certification to the Register of Deeds of any such map or maps, it shall be unlawful to build upon any land within the lines of proposed streets shown thereon or to repair or otherwise improve any existing buildings within such lines until the Town Council shall have been given an opportunity to purchase or otherwise acquire the property for street purposes as provided by this section. To that end, any person proposing to build upon such land or to make repairs or improvements to any existing building on such land shall, in writing, notify the Town Council of the nature and estimated cost of such building, repairs or improvements. The Town Council shall then determine whether it will take necessary steps to acquire the land prior to construction of said building or the making of said repairs or improvements. If the Town Council fails, within sixty (60) days from the receipt of such notice, to acquire, adopt a formal resolution directing an appropriate officer to acquire, or institute condemnation proceeding to acquire the property, then the owner or other person giving notice may proceed to erect the building or to make the repairs or improvements described in such notice. The building inspector is authorized to withhold and refrain from issuing, for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days from receipt by the Town Council of the notice herein prescribed, any building permit for the erection of any building within the lines, or for the making of any repairs or improvements to existing buildings within such lines. 
(e)  Failure to give written notice; bar to recovery for value of improvements. If any person, firm or corporation builds upon any land included within the proposed street lines, or repairs or otherwise improves that part of any existing building within such lines without giving the Town Council an opportunity to acquire the property free from improvements, as provided in this section, the Town Council shall not be required to pay for the value of such building, repairs, or improvements in any proceeding subsequently brought to acquire the land for the purpose shown on the officially adopted map or maps. 
(f)  Failure of the town to act; no limit to subsequent condemnation. The failure of the Town Council to take action under subsection (d) of this section within sixty (60) days after notice shall not have the effect of limiting the right of the Town Council at any subsequent time to condemn the land in question. In such case, however, the owner shall be entitled to full compensation as now provided by law for the building, repairs, or improvements made after the failure of the Town Council to take action within the prescribed period.

The ordinance creating the conditional use district may not set forth exceptions that are less stringent than those of the referenced general use district, but may provide (by way of illustration without limitation) that only one or a few of the uses permitted within the referenced general use district shall be permissible within the conditional use district, or that increased setback distances shall apply within the conditional use district. 
(c)  A conditional use zoning district may be applied to particular property only upon the submission by the property owner or a person acting on his behalf of a petition seeking an amendment to the official zoning map to have the zoning classification of his property changed to such conditional use zoning district.

Sec. 6.4. - Overlay districts. 
(a)  In addition to the authority conferred in Article 19 of Chapter 160A of the General Statutes, the Town may provide within its land use ordinance for the creation and amendments of overlay zoning districts in accordance with the provisions of this section and the applicable law. These overlay districts may be applied to certain designated areas within which development should be made subject to certain restrictions over and above those applicable to the underlying general use districts. 
(b)  Overlay districts may be established in designated areas where critical concern is recognized for protection of natural systems (such as the groundwater, surfacewater, drainageways, flood hazard areas, areas of poor soils, etc.), and for promotion of quality in manmade systems (such as preserving or improving scenic views along major thoroughfares, etc.), or for achieving other public objectives (such as infill development or other forms of revitalization) in specially designated areas. 
(c)  Within these overlay districts, any development that occurs must be in compliance not only with the regulations applicable to the underlying general use districts but also with the additional requirements of the overlay districts. In instances of conflict, the overlay district regulations shall take precedence. 
Sec. 6.5. - Additional eminent domain powers. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of G.S. 40A-1, in the exercise of its authority of eminent domain for the acquisition of property interests (including, without limitation, fee simple title, rights-of-way, and easements) to be used for: (i) water lines and treatment facilities; (ii) sewer lines and treatment facilities; (iii) electric distribution and transmission facilities; and (iv) opening, widening, extending, or improving public streets and roads, the town may use the procedure and authority prescribed in G.S. Article 9 of Chapter 136, as now or hereafter amended; provided further, that whenever therein the words "Secretary" or "Secretary of Transportation" appear, they shall be deemed to include the "Town Manager", and whenever therein the word "highway" appears, it is deemed to include "public works" in accordance with this section, provided further that nothing herein shall be construed to enlarge the power of the town to condemn property already devoted to public use. Provided further, just compensation for the acquisition of fee simple title, or a perpetual easement, pursuant to this section, to be used for street or road right-of-way, shall be no less than (i) one dollar ($1.00) per square foot of real property taken, or (ii) the prorated ad valorem tax value of the parent tract, whichever is less. Just compensation for the acquisition of fee simple title or a perpetual easement pursuant to this section to be used for electric distribution and transmission facilities shall be no less than: (i) fifty cents ($0.50) per square foot of real property taken, or (ii) one-half the prorated ad valorem tax value of the parent tract, whichever is less. The powers granted by this section are in addition to and supplementary to those powers granted by any local or general law. 
(S.L. 1987, Ch. 170, § 1; Amend. of 7-16-03; S.L. 2003-88, § 1, 5-29-03; S.L. 2007-37, § 2, 5-8-07) 
Sec. 6.6. - [Regulating subdivision funds in lieu of parkland or open space dedication.] 
    In addition to authority granted by G.S. 160A-372, the town of Apex, in the exercise of its powers to regulate the subdivision of land subject to its jurisdiction, is authorized to determine the amount of funds to be paid as a fee in lieu of parkland or open space dedication by using a formula based upon a charge per dwelling unit of the development or subdivision without reference to property tax value; provided that this charge may vary depending on the size or type of the dwelling unit; and further provided that the collection, maintenance, and use of such funds are otherwise consistent with G.S. 160A-372. In no event may a fee in lieu of parkland or open space dedication that is required for a development of a subdivision exceed the fair market value of the land area that would have otherwise been required to be dedicated. For the purpose of this section, fair market value is to be determined with respect to a development or subdivision, at the time the initial development application submittal is made to the Town of Apex. 
(S.L. 1995, Ch. 722, § 1) 
Sec. 6.7. - [Approval of site plans.] 
    As a part of its zoning regulations, the Town of Apex shall have the same authority to condition the approval of site plans upon the dedication or reservation of property, the making of public improvements, or the payment of fees in lieu of dedication, reservation, or public improvements as the Town of Apex has under its powers to regulate the subdivision of land. For purposes of this section, "site plan" excludes single family detached residences.

When subsequent ordinances repeal any chapter, section or subsection or any portion thereof, such repealed portions may be excluded from said Code by omission from reprinted pages. 
    Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code may be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section of this Code in substantially the following language: "That section _______ of the Code of Ordinances is hereby amended to read as follows: _______ (Set out new provisions in full) _______." 
    When the governing body desires to enact an ordinance of a general and permanent nature on a subject not heretofore existing in the Code, which the governing body desires to incorporate into the Code, a section in substantially the following language may be made a part of the ordinance: 
    "Section _______. It is the intention of the governing body, and it is hereby ordained that the provisions of this ordinance shall become and be made a part of the Code of Ordinances and the sections of this ordinance may be renumbered to accomplish such intention." 
    All sections, articles, chapters or provisions of this Code desired to be repealed shall be specifically repealed by section or chapter number, as the case may be.

Sec. 1-8. - General penalty; enforcement of ordinances; continuing violations. 
(a)  Unless otherwise specifically provided, violation of any provision of this Code or any other ordinance shall be a misdemeanor or an infraction as the case may be, as provided by section 14-4 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, and punishable as provided therein. 
(b)  Violation of any provision of this Code or any other ordinance shall subject the offender to a civil penalty to be recovered by the town in a civil action in the nature of debt if the offender does not pay the penalty within a period of time prescribed by the court after such offender has been cited for such violation. 
(c)  Any provision of this Code or any other ordinance may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. In such case, the General Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application of the town for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law. 
(d)  Any provision of this Code or any other ordinance that makes unlawful a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced by injunction and order of abatement, and the General Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders. When a violation of such a provision occurs, the town may apply to the appropriate division of the General Court of Justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of the property. The action shall be governed in all respects by the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including the Rules of Civil Procedure in general and Rule 65 in particular. In addition to an injunction, the court may enter an order of abatement as a part of the judgment in the cause. An order of abatement may direct that buildings or other structures on the property be closed, demolished or removed; that fixtures, furniture or other movable property be removed from buildings on the property; that grass and weeds be cut; that improvements or repairs be made; or that any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with this Code or such ordinance. If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, such defendant may be cited for contempt, and the town may execute the order of abatement. The town shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic's and materialman's lien. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by the clerk of superior court in an amount approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith. 
(e)  The provisions of this Code and any other ordinance may be enforced by any one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this section. 
(f)  Except as otherwise specifically provided, each day's continuing violation of any provision of this Code or any other ordinance shall be a separate and distinct offense.

(d)  The use of electronic means to publish legal notices of public hearings shall not supersede any state law that requires notice by mail to certain classes of persons or the posting of signs on certain property. 
(e)  This section does not apply to public hearings covered by the Unified Development Ordinance (UDO) because the UDO has its own section allowing publication by electronic means.

The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the code enforcement officer. 
(b)  Procedure after hearing. After the notice and hearing, the code enforcement officer shall state in writing such official's determination whether the dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, and, if so, whether it is deteriorated or dilapidated. 
(1)  If the code enforcement officer determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is deteriorated, such officer shall state in writing the findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served on the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter and improve the dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this article within a specified period of time, not to exceed 90 days. The order may also direct and require the owner to vacate and close the dwelling or dwelling unit until the repairs, alterations, and improvements have been made.

(c)  Failure to comply with order. 
(1)  In personam remedy. If the owner of any deteriorated dwelling or dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the code enforcement officer to repair, alter or improve the same within the time specified therein or if the owner of a dilapidated dwelling shall fail to comply with an order of the code enforcement officer to vacate, close, remove or demolish the same within the time specified therein, the code enforcement officer shall submit to the town council at its next regular meeting a resolution directing the town attorney to petition the superior court for an order directing the owner to comply with the order of the code enforcement officer, as authorized by the General Statutes.

Sec. 5-145. - General requirements. 
(a)  Soil erosion and sedimentation control plan, letter of soil erosion and sedimentation control plan approval and certificate of compliance required. No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity which uncovers more than 20,000 square feet without having a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan approved by the town as evidenced by receipt of a letter of soil erosion and sedimentation control plan approval. Applicants shall receive a letter of soil erosion and sedimentation control plan approval only after all required tree protection fencing is installed and inspected. Before installing any approved erosion and sedimentation control measures the applicant must have received the letter of soil erosion and sedimentation control plan approval. No land disturbing activity, other than the installation of the erosion and sedimentation control measures, shall be started until the town issues a certificate of compliance to the applicant. A certificate of compliance will be signed once all the measures shown on the approved soil erosion and sedimentation control plan are installed, inspected and approved. Sites must follow the approved soil erosion and sedimentation control plan which includes the construction sequence. Grading and development of sites, including single-family residential lots, not exceeding 20,000 square feet shall meet the requirements of subsection (b) of this section. 
(b)  Grading and development of sites including single-family residential lots not exceeding 20,000 square feet in surface area shall implement and maintain control measures to restrain erosion and prevent off-site sediment migration. No person shall initiate any land disturbing activity under 20,000 square feet without submitting an erosion and sedimentation control installation and maintenance agreement for residential lots. Minimum required measures will include: silt fencing (steel posts, woven wire, and silt fence geotextile fabric), construction entrances, and downstream rock check dams in ditch lines. Disturbed areas shall not be left exposed after 15 working days or 30 calendar days of completion of any phase of grading. No footing inspection by the building inspection division shall be approved without proper installation of the required sedimentation and erosion control measures. 
(c)  Protection of property. Persons conducting land-disturbing activity shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and private property from damage caused by such activity. 
(d)  More restrictive rules shall apply. Whenever conflicts exist between federal, state, or local laws, ordinance or rules, the more restrictive provision shall apply. 
(e)  Applicants shall post a performance guarantee as provided by section 5-162 of the Apex Town Code. 
(f)  Construction site waste management plan. The development of all sites requiring a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan must adhere to the requirements as stated in the construction site waste management plan. 
(Ord. of 7-16-96, § 5; Ord. No. 05-0719-11, § 1, 7-19-05; Ord. No. 09-0804-07, § 1, 8-4-09; Ord. No. 2015-0915-36, § 2, 9-15-2015) 
Sec. 5-146. - Basic control objectives. 
    A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan may be disapproved pursuant to section 5-157 of this article if the plan fails to address the following control objectives: 
(1)  Identify critical areas. On-site areas which are subject to severe erosion, and off-site areas which are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special attention. 
(2)  Limit time of exposure. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time In any event, areas left exposed will, within 15 working days or 30 calendar days of completion of any phase of grading, whichever period is shorter, be planted or otherwise provided with ground cover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion. 
(3)  Limit exposed areas. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time. 
(4)  Control surface water. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of exposure. 
(5)  Control sedimentation. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted so as to prevent off-site sedimentation damage. 
(6)  Manage stormwater runoff. When the increase in the velocity of stormwater runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans are to include measures to control the velocity to the point of discharge so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and increased sedimentation of the stream. Measures are to be implemented to ensure that post-development stream velocities of the receiving watercourses do not exceed the pre-development velocities as defined in section 5-149 of this article. 
(Ord. of 7-16-96, § 6; Ord. No. 05-0719-11, § 1, 7-19-05) 
Sec. 5-147. - Mandatory standards for land-disturbing activity. 
    No land-disturbing activity subject to the control of this article shall be undertaken except in accordance with the following mandatory standards: 
(1)  Buffer zone. 
a.  No land-disturbing activity during periods of construction or improvement to land shall be permitted in proximity to a lake or natural watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided along the margin of the watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the 25 percent of the buffer zone nearest the land-disturbing activity. This subdivision shall not apply to a land-disturbing activity in connection with the construction of facilities to be located on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse. Refer to section 6.1, watershed protection overlay districts, of the town's UDO for primary and secondary buffers. 
b.  Unless otherwise provided, the width of a buffer zone is measured horizontally from the top of the bank (nearest the land-disturbing activity) of the stream or waterbody to the nearest edge of the disturbed area. The 25 percent of the strip nearest the land-disturbing activity must contain natural or artificial means of confining visible siltation. 
(2)  Graded slopes and fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no greater than the angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or other adequate erosion control devices or structures. In any event, slopes left exposed will, within 21 calendar days of completion of any phase of grading, whichever period is shorter, be planted or otherwise provided with groundcover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion. 
(3)  Groundcover. Whenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on a tract compromising more than 20,000 square feet, if more than 20,000 square feet is uncovered, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install such sedimentation and erosion control devices and practices as are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of said tract, and shall plant or otherwise provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after completion of construction or development. All seeding and mulch activities shall be stabilized with a tackifier, netting or other suitable material that secures the mulch. Except as provided in section 5-148(b)(5) of this article, provisions for a ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be accomplished 15 working days or 30 calendar days following completion of construction or development whichever period is shorter. 
(4)  Prior plan approval. No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity on a tract if more than 20,000 square feet is to be uncovered unless, 30 or more days prior to initiating the activity, a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for such activity is filed with and approved by the town as outlined in section 5-145. 
(5)  Fill material. Unless a permit from the state department of environment and natural resources division of solid waste management to operate a landfill is on file for the official site, acceptable fill material shall be free of organic or other degradable materials, masonry, concrete and brick in sizes exceeding 12 inches, and any materials which would cause the site to be regulated or a landfill by the state. 
(6)  The land-disturbing activity shall be conducted in accordance with the approved soil erosion and sedimentation control plan. 
(Ord. of 7-16-96, § 7; Ord. No. 05-0719-11, § 1, 7-19-05; Ord. No. 07-0821-12, § 2, 8-21-07) 
Sec. 5-148. - Design and performance standards. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) herein, erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices shall be so planned, designed, and constructed as to provide protection from the calculated maximum peak rate of runoff from the 25-year storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the USDA Soil Conservation Service's "National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices," or other acceptable calculation procedures. 
(b)  In high quality water (HQW) zones the following design standards shall apply: 
(1)  Uncovered areas in HQW zones shall be limited at any time to a maximum total area within the boundaries of the tract of 20 acres. Only the portion of the land-disturbing activity within a HQW zone shall be governed by this section. Larger areas may be uncovered within the boundaries of the tract with the written approval of the director. 
(2)  Erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices within HQW zones shall be so planned, designed and constructed to provide protection from the run off of the 25-year storm which produces the maximum peak rate of run-off as calculated according to procedures in the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service's "National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices" or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of this state or the United States or any generally recognized organization or association. 
(3)  Sediment basins within HQW zones shall be designed and constructed such that the basin will have a settling efficiency of at least 70 percent for the 40 micron (0.04 mm) size soil particle transported into the basin by the runoff of that two-year storm which produces the maximum peak rate of runoff as calculated according to procedures in the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service's "National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices" or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of this state or the United States or any generally recognized organization or association. 
(4)  Newly constructed open channels in HQW zones shall be designed and constructed with side slopes no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical if a vegetative cover is used for stabilization unless soil conditions permit a steeper slope or where the slopes are stabilized by using mechanical devices, structural devices, or other acceptable ditch liners. In any event, the angle for side slope shall be sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion. 
(5)  Ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be provided for any portion of a land-disturbing activity in a HQW zone within 15 working days or 60 calendar days following completion of construction or development, whichever period is shorter. 
(Ord. of 7-16-96, § 8; Ord. No. 05-0719-11, § 1, 7-19-05; Ord. No. 07-0821-12, § 3, 8-21-07) 
Sec. 5-149. - Stormwater outlet protection. 
(a)  Intent. Stream banks and channels downstream from any land disturbing activity shall be protected from increased degradation by accelerated erosion caused by increased velocity of runoff from the land disturbing activity. 
(b)  Performance standards. Persons shall conduct land-disturbing activity so that the post construction velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse to the discharge point does not exceed the greater of: 
(1)  The velocity established by the table in subsection (d) of this section; or 
(2)  The velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse prior to development. 
If conditions (1) or (2) of this subsection cannot be met, then the receiving watercourse to and including the discharge point shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity anywhere the velocity exceeds the prior to development velocity by ten percent. 
(c)  Acceptable management measures. Measures applied along or in combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are no objectionable secondary consequences. The commission recognizes that the management of stormwater runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and bank erosion is a developing technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce successful results. Some alternatives are to: 
(1)  Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas rendered impervious. 
(2)  Avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in lieu of closed drains and high velocity paved sections. 
(3)  Provide energy dissipaters at outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities to the point of discharge. These may range from simple rip-rapped sections to complex structures. 
(4)  Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving cross sections and/or providing erosion-resistant lining. 
(5)  Upgrade or replace the receiving device structure or watercourse such that it will receive and conduct the flow to a point where it is no longer subject to degradation from the increased rate of flow or increased velocity. 
(6)  Energy dissipaters and outlet structures shall not be constructed in riparian buffer areas unless no practical alternative exists. In any event, there shall be no direct discharge of stormwater into watercourses. 
(d)  Exceptions. This rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated that stormwater discharge velocities will not create an erosion problem in the receiving watercourse. 
(e)  Maximum permissible velocities. The following is a table for maximum permissible velocity for stormwater discharges:

(Ord. of 7-16-96, § 9; Ord. No. 05-0719-11, § 1, 7-19-05) 
Sec. 5-150. - Borrow and waste areas. 
    When the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is also the person conducting the borrow or waste disposal activity, areas from which borrow is obtained and which are not regulated by the provisions of the Mining Act of 1971, and waste areas for surplus materials other than landfills regulated by the department's division of solid waste management shall be considered as part of the land-disturbing activity where the borrow material is being used or from which the waste material originated. When the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is not the person obtaining the borrow and/or disposing of the waste, these areas shall be considered a separate land-disturbing activity. 
(Ord. of 7-16-96, § 10; Ord. No. 05-0719-11, § 1, 7-19-05) 
Sec. 5-151. - Access and haul roads. 
    Temporary access and haul roads, other than public roads, constructed or used in connection with any land-disturbing activity shall be considered a part of such activity. 
(Ord. of 7-16-96, § 11; Ord. No. 05-0719-11, § 1, 7-19-05) 
Sec. 5-152. - Operations in lakes or natural watercourses. 
    Land-disturbing activity in connection with construction in, on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse shall be planned and conducted in such a manner as to minimize the extent and duration of disturbance of the stream channel. The relocation of a stream, where relocation is an essential part of the proposed activity, shall be planned and executed so as to minimize changes in the stream flow characteristics, except when justification for significant alteration to flow characteristic is provided. 
(Ord. of 7-16-96, § 12; Ord. No. 05-0719-11, § 1, 7-19-05) 
Sec. 5-153. - Responsibility for maintenance. 
    During the development of a site, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install and maintain all temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation control measures as required by the approved soil erosion and sedimentation control plan or any provision of this article, the Act, or any order adopted pursuant to this article or the Act. After site development, the landowner or person in possession or control of the land shall install and/or maintain all necessary permanent erosion and sediment control measures, except those measures installed within a road or street right-of-way or easement accepted for maintenance by a governmental agency. 
(Ord. of 7-16-96, § 13; Ord. No. 05-0719-11, § 1, 7-19-05) 
Sec. 5-154. - Additional measures. 
    Whenever the town determines that significant sedimentation is occurring as a result of land-disturbing activity, despite application and maintenance of protective practices, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity will be required to and shall take additional protective action. 
(Ord. of 7-16-96, § 14; Ord. No. 05-0719-11, § 1, 7-19-05) 
Sec. 5-155. - Existing uncovered areas. 
(a)  All uncovered areas existing on the effective date of this article which resulted from land-disturbing activity, exceed 20,000 square feet, are subject to continued accelerated erosion, and are causing off-site damage from sedimentation, shall be provided with a ground cover or other protective measures, structures, or devices sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion and control off-site sedimentation. 
(b)  The town will serve upon the landowner or other person in possession or control of the land a written notice of violation by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any means authorized under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4. The notice will set forth the measures needed to comply and will state the time within which such measures must be completed. In determining the measures required and the time allowed for compliance, the authority serving notice shall take into consideration the economic feasibility, technology, and quantity of work required, and shall set reasonable and attainable time limits of compliance. 
(c)  The town reserves the right to require preparation and approval of a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan (with appropriate fees) in any instance where extensive control measures are required. 
(d)  This rule shall not require ground cover on cleared land forming the future basin of a planned reservoir. 
(Ord. of 7-16-96, § 15; Ord. No. 05-0719-11, § 1, 7-19-05) 
Sec. 5-156. - Procedures related to soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. 
(a)  In determining the area to be disturbed, lands under one or diverse ownership being developed as a unit will be aggregated. If the combined total area of aggregated lots in any subdivision equals 20,000 square feet by one owner, a grading fee and a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan will be required even if the lots are not contiguous. 
(b)  A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan may be disapproved if implementation of the plan would result in a violation of rules adopted by the environmental management commission, other town rules, or for failure to pay fees or fines owed to the town. 
(c)  The town will establish a fee schedule and payment shall be required. 
(d)  All proposed soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall be filed with the town accompanied by appropriate fees and a copy shall be simultaneously submitted to the Wake Soil and Water Conservation District, at least 30 days prior to the anticipated commencement of the proposed activity. The town shall forward to the director of the division of water quality a copy of each soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for a land-disturbing activity that involves the utilization of ditches for the purpose of de-watering or lowering the water table of the tract, pursuant to G.S. 113A-57(4). 
(e)  All applicants shall file two copies of the soil erosion and sedimentation control plan with the town, at least 30 days prior to the anticipated beginning of such activity and shall keep a copy of the approved plan on file at the job site. After approving the plan, if the town either upon review of such plan or on inspection of the job site, determines that a significant risk of accelerated erosion or off-site sedimentation exists, the town will require a revised soil erosion and sedimentation control plan. Pending the preparation of the revised plan, work shall cease or shall continue under conditions outlined by the town public works and utilities director. 
(f)  Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans may be disapproved unless accompanied by an authorized statement of financial responsibility and ownership. This statement shall be signed by the person financially responsible for the land-disturbing activity or his attorney in fact. The statement shall include the mailing and street addresses of the principal place of business of: (1) the person financially responsible; (2) the owner of the land; and (3) any registered agents. If the person financially responsible is not a resident of North Carolina, a North Carolina agent must be designated in the statement for the purpose of receiving notice of compliance or noncompliance with the plan, the Act, this article, or rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this article as well as for service of civil summonses and complaints. If the applicant is not the owner of the land to be disturbed, the draft soil erosion and sedimentation control plan must include the owner's written consent for the applicant to submit a draft soil erosion and sedimentation control plan and to conduct the land-disturbing activity. 
(g)  The Wake Soil and Water Conservation District shall review the soil erosion and sedimentation control plan and submit any comments and recommendations to the town within 20 days after the soil and water conservation district received the soil erosion and sedimentation control plan or within any shorter period of time as may be agreed upon by the soil and water conservation district and the town. Failure of the soil and water conservation district to submit its comments and recommendations within 20 days or within any agreed upon shorter period of time shall not delay final action on the plan. 
(h)  The town will review each complete soil erosion and sedimentation control plan submitted to them and within 30 days of receipt thereof will notify the person submitting the plan that it has been approved, approved with modifications, approved with performance reservations, or disapproved. Any type of approval shall be indicated by the town's executing the letter of plan approval to the applicant. The letter of plan approval is issued only after the tree protection fencing (if applicable to the project) is inspected and approved by the town's planning and community development department. Failure to either approve, approve with modifications, approve with performance reservations, or disapprove a completed soil erosion and sedimentation control plan within 30 days of receipt shall be deemed approval. Disapproval of a plan must specifically state in writing the reasons for disapproval. The town must approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove a revised plan within 15 days of receipt, or it is deemed to be approved. If, following commencement of a land-disturbing activity pursuant to an approved soil erosion and sedimentation control plan, the town determines that the plan is inadequate to meet the requirements of this article, the town may require any revision of the plan that is necessary to comply with this ordinance. Failure to approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove a revised erosion control plan within 15 days of receipt shall be deemed approval of the plan. If land disturbing activities are not initiated within one year from the date of the letter of plan approval, plan approval shall expire and a new plan submittal is required. The approval of an soil erosion and sedimentation control plan is conditioned upon the applicant's compliance with federal and state water quality laws, regulations and rules pursuant to G.S. 113A-61(b)(1). Documentation of compliance with federal and state water quality laws, rules and regulations from the regulating agency shall be submitted at the request of the plan reviewer. 
(i)  Any soil erosion and sedimentation control plan submitted for a land-disturbing activity for which an environmental document is required by the North Carolina Environmental Policy Act (G.S. 113A-1 et seq.) shall be deemed incomplete until a complete environmental document is available for review. The town shall promptly notify the person submitting the plan that the 30-day time limit for review of the plan pursuant to subsection (h) of this section shall not begin until a complete environmental document is available for review. 
(j)  The soil erosion and sedimentation control plan required by this section shall contain architectural and engineering drawings, maps, assumptions, calculations, and narrative statements appropriately sealed by the responsible designer as needed to adequately describe the proposed development of the tract and the measures planned to comply with the requirements of this article. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plan content may vary to meet the needs of specific site requirements. Detailed mandatory guidelines for plan preparation shall be drafted by the public works department of the town and may be obtained from the town on request. 
(k)  The town may disapprove a plan or draft plans if implementation of the plan would result in a violation of the rules adopted by the environmental management commission to protect riparian buffers along surface waters. The town may disapprove or revoke a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan upon a finding that an applicant, or a parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of the applicant: 
(1)  Is conducting or has conducted land-disturbing activity without an approved soil erosion and sedimentation control plan, or has received notice of violation of a plan previously approved by the commission or a local government pursuant to the Act and has not complied with the notice within the time specified in the notice; 
(2)  Has failed to pay a civil penalty assessed pursuant to the Act or a local ordinance adopted pursuant to the Act by the time the payment is due; 
(3)  Has been convicted of a misdemeanor pursuant to G.S. 113A-64(b) or any criminal provision of a local ordinance adopted pursuant to the Act; 
(4)  Has failed to pay appropriate fees required by the town; or 
(5)  Has failed to substantially comply with state rules or local ordinances and regulations adopted pursuant to the Act. 
    For purposes of this subsection an applicant's record may be considered for only the two years prior to the application date. 
    In the event that a plan is disapproved pursuant to this subsection, the town shall notify the director of such disapproval within ten days. The town shall advise the applicant and the director in writing as to the specific reasons that the plan was disapproved. 
(l)  Applications for amendment of a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan in written and/or graphic form may be made at any time under the same conditions as the original application. Until such time as said amendment is approved by the town the land-disturbing activity shall not proceed except in accordance with the soil erosion and sedimentation control plan as originally approved. 
(m)  No person may initiate a land-disturbing activity in accordance with an approved plan before notifying the town of the date that the land-disturbing will begin. 
(n)  When deemed necessary by the town, a preconstruction conference may be required. 
(o)  Any person engaged in land-disturbing activity who fails to file a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan in accordance with this article, or who conducts a land-disturbing activity except in accordance with provisions of an approved soil erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
(p)  The public works director may issue a stop work order to any person in violation of any section of this article. 
(q)  Fees. The town shall adopt and periodically update a fee schedule to cover the costs of administering the sediment and erosion control program. 
(Ord. of 7-16-96, § 16; Ord. No. 05-0719-11, § 1, 7-19-05; Ord. No. 07-0821-12, §§ 4-6, 8-21-07) 
Sec. 5-157. - Appeals. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the appeal of a disapproval or approval with modifications of a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be governed by the following provisions: 
(1)  The disapproval or modification of any proposed soil erosion and sedimentation control plan by the town shall entitle the person submitting the plan to a public hearing if such person submits written demand for a hearing to the town clerk within 15 days after receipt of written notice of disapproval or modification. 
(2)  Hearings held pursuant to this section shall be conducted by the town council within 30 days after the date of the town's receipt of the appeal or request for a hearing. 
(3)  The town council will render its final decision on any soil erosion and sedimentation control plan upon which a hearing is requested within 20 days of the close of the hearings record. 
(4)  If the town upholds the disapproval or modification of a proposed soil erosion and sedimentation control plan following the hearing, the person submitting the plan shall then be entitled to appeal the local government's decision to the state sedimentation control commission as provided in G.S. 113A-61(c) and title 15A NCAC 4B.0018(d). 
(b)  In the event that a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan is disapproved pursuant to section 5-156(k) of this article, the town shall notify the director of the division of land resources of such disapproval within ten days. The town shall advise the applicant and the director in writing as to the specific reasons that the plan was disapproved. The applicant may appeal the town disapproval of the soil erosion and sedimentation control plan pursuant to section 5-156 of this article directly to the commission. 
(Ord. of 7-16-96, § 17; Ord. No. 05-0719-11, § 1, 7-19-05) 
Sec. 5-158. - Inspections and investigations. 
(a)  Agents, officials, or other qualified persons authorized by the town will periodically inspect land-disturbing activities to ensure compliance with the Act, this article, or rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this article, and to determine whether the measures required in the soil erosion and sedimentation control plan are effecting in controlling erosion and sediment resulting from land-disturbing activity. Notice of the right to inspect shall be included in the letter of soil erosion and sedimentation control plan approval of each soil erosion and sedimentation control plan. 
(b)  No person shall willfully resist, delay, or obstruct an authorized representative, employee, or agent of the town while that person is inspecting or attempting to inspect a land-disturbing activity under this section. 
(c)  If, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activity has failed to comply with the Act, this article, or rules, or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this article, a notice of violation shall be served upon that person. The notice may be served by any means authorized under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4 or in the case of violations on single-family residential lots, be served by personnel service with a return of service form. 
The notice shall specify a date by which the person must comply with the Act, or this article, or rules, or orders adopted pursuant to this article, and inform the person of the actions that need to be taken to comply with the Act, this article, or rules or orders adopted pursuant to this article. However, no time period for compliance need be given for failure to submit a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for approval or for obstructing, hampering or interfering with an authorized representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. Any person who fails to comply within the time specified is subject to the civil and criminal penalties provided in this article. 
(d)  The town shall have the power to conduct such investigation as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land-disturbing activity. 
(e)  The town shall also have the power to require written statements, or the filing of reports under oath, with respect to pertinent questions relating to land-disturbing activity. 
(f)  The landowner, the financially responsible party, or the landowner's or the financially responsible party's agent shall perform an inspection of the area covered by the plan after each phase of the plan has been completed and after establishment of temporary ground cover in accordance with G.S. 113A-57(2). The person who performs the inspection shall maintain and make available a record of the inspection at the site of the land-disturbing activity. The record shall set out any significant deviation from the approved erosion control plan, identify any measures that may be required to correct the deviation, and document the completion of those measures. The record shall be maintained until permanent ground cover has been established as required by the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan. The inspections required by this subsection shall be in addition to inspections required by G.S. 113A-61.1. 
(Ord. of 7-16-96, § 18; Ord. No. 05-0719-11, § 1, 7-19-05; Ord. No. 07-0821-12, § 7, 8-21-07) 
Sec. 5-159. - Penalties. 
(a)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  Any person who violates any of the provisions of this article, or rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this article, or who initiates or continues a land-disturbing activity for which an soil erosion and sedimentation control plan is required except in accordance with the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved plan, is subject to a civil penalty. The maximum civil penalty for a violation is $5,000.00. Civil penalties may be assessed from the date of the violation. However, no penalty shall be assessed until the person alleged to be in violation has been notified of the violation as provided in subsection 5-158(c) of this article. If, after the allotted time period has expired, the violator has not completed corrective action a civil penalty may be assessed. Nevertheless, no time period for compliance need be given for failure to submit a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for approval, proceeding with the work before the letter of plan approval is signed by the town, or for obstructing, hampering or interfering with an authorized representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. Proceeding with work before the letter of soil erosion and sedimentation control plan approval is signed shall constitute grading without a permit. Each day of continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation. 
In addition to the civil penalty schedule listed below, the public works and utilities director may assess a one-time civil penalty of $5,000.00 on the day of the violation for off-site sedimentation damage especially in the case of damage to a body of water, wetlands or buffer. Moreover, any malicious or intentional destruction of silt fencing or other sedimentation and erosion control device will result in a one-time fine of up to $1,000.00. 
Civil penalties for specific violations may be assessed as follows: 
Grading without a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan or land-disturbing permit: $5,000.00 per day for failure to secure a valid, required land disturbing permit (certificate of compliance) prior to conducting a land-disturbing activity. 
Grading beyond the limits of a grading permit: $1,000.00 per day per 1/10 of a graded acre beyond the limits of an existing grading permit without the approval of an amended grading permit, but not to exceed $5,000.00 per day. 
Failure to protect: $5,000.00 per day for failure to take all reasonable measures to protect public property or private property, from damage caused by the failure to retain sediment on-site. 
Failure to follow soil erosion and sedimentation control plan: $3,000.00 per day for failure to conduct a land disturbing activity in accordance with the provisions of an approved erosion and sedimentation control plan. 
Failure to install devices: $5,000.00 per day for failure, when more than one acre is disturbed ($2,500.00 per day when 20,000 square feet or less than 20,000 square feet is disturbed), to install erosion and sedimentation control devices sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract(s) and prevent off-site sedimentation. 
Failure to maintain permanent and/or temporary measures: $2,500.00 per day for failure to maintain adequate erosion control measures. 
Failure to maintain properly slopes and fills: $2,500.00 per day for failure on graded slopes and fills to maintain an angle sufficient to retain vegetative cover or other adequate erosion control measures. 
Failure to protect exposed slopes: $2,500.00 per day for failure, within 15 working days or 30 calendar days of completion of any phase of grading, whichever period is shorter, to plant or otherwise provide exposed, graded slopes or fills with groundcover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion. 
Failure to provide adequate cover: $2,500.00 per day for failure, within 15 working days or 30 calendar days of competition of any phase of grading, whichever is shorter, to plant or otherwise provide exposed, graded slopes or fills with groundcover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion. 
Failure to correct a violation after notice: $5,000.00 per day for failure to correct violation within the time limitations established in a notice of violation. 
Failure to revise plan: $2,500.00 per day for failure to file an acceptable revised erosion and sedimentation control plan within the established deadline after being notified of the need to do so. 
Any other action or failure to act that constitutes a violation of this article: $2,500.00 per day for any other action or failure to act that constitutes a violation of this article. 
Failure to keep dirt and mud off public streets: $1,000.00 per day for failure to prevent the accumulation of more than one-fourth-inch of dirt, mud, both on public streets, or in public storm drainage, plus $500.00 per hour per wash truck if the street is cleaned by the town, its employees or its contractors. 
Failure to follow the construction site waste management plan is subject to $1,000.00 per day for failing to follow all aspects of the plan. 
An additional civil penalty of $1,000.00 per day shall be charged to any person assessed a civil penalty for any violation of this article within the prior two years. A person may be assessed a civil penalty from the date the violation is detected if the deadline stated is not met. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation. 
(2)  The town public works and utilities director shall determine the amount of the civil penalty to be assessed. In determining the amount of the penalty the town public works and utilities director shall consider the degree and extent of harm caused by the violation and the cost of rectifying the damage, the amount of money the violator saved by noncompliance, whether the violation was committed willfully, and the prior record of the violator in complying of failing to comply with this article. 
(3)  The town public works and utilities director shall provide notice of the civil penalty amount and basis for assessment to the person assessed. The notice of assessment shall be served by any means authorized under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4, and shall direct the violator to either pay the assessment or contest the assessment, within 30 days after receipt of the notice of assessment, by written demand for a hearing. 
(4)  A hearing on a civil penalty shall be conducted by the town board of adjustment within 30 days after the date of the written demand for the hearing. The board shall render its final decision on the civil penalty within 20 days after the close of the hearing record. Appeal from the final decision of the town board of adjustment shall be to the superior court of the county where the violation occurred, or the location of the violator's residence or principal place of business. 
(5)  If payment is not received within 30 days after demand for payment is made the town may institute a civil action to recover the amount of the assessment. The civil action may be brought in the superior court of the county where the violation occurred, or the violator's residence or principal place of business is located. Such civil actions must be filed within three years of the date the assessment was due. An assessment that is not contested is due when the violator is served with a notice of assessment. An assessment that is contested is due at the conclusion of the administrative and judicial review of the assessment.

As a condition of receiving electric service the owner of every residential property for which a building permit is issued after September 1, 1993 shall, prior to receiving a certificate of occupancy, install a load management device for said building. The load management device shall be furnished free of charge by the town. 
(1)  Initial installation. With respect to new residential construction, upon obtaining a building permit as required by state law, the owner or the owner's contractor shall install the original load management device in accordance with the town's specifications. 
(2)  Exemptions from installation. The following residential construction is exempt from the requirement of subsection (1): 
a.  Building permits for repairs and renovations to residential construction of less than $10,000.00. 
b.  The common areas of condominiums, cooperatives and homeowners associations. 
c.  The electric utilities director may exempt such systems as are technically not feasible for control by load management devices. 
(3)  No person shall prevent, alter or impede the operation of a load management device. Such action is a violation of the electric service agreement between the consumer and the town and subjects the offender in the case of an intentional violation to a penalty of $100.00, and in the case of an unintentional violation, a penalty of $25.00. Payment is due within ten days after written notice thereof. Payment of such a penalty shall be a condition of the continued provision of electric service. Any questions or requests regarding the function, operation or maintenance of the load management device shall be directed to the town. 
(4)  The town shall grant a credit against the electric bill for the use of load management devices, whether installed voluntarily or involuntarily, in such amount as the town council shall determine in its schedule of electric rates. 
(5)  After initial load management device installation, the town shall be responsible for maintenance and/or replacement of the load management device. Replacement of the device shall be at the town's discretion. When maintenance or replacement of the load management device is required, the property owner or tenant shall contact the town to request repair of the load management device unless the repair or maintenance is initiated by the town. Reasonable access shall be granted for said maintenance or replacement. 
(6)  In the event a private contractor or any other entity performing services at a location with a load management device disconnects the device, or in the event the device has already been disconnected, that private contractor or entity shall reconnect the load management device after the work is completed. The entity reconnecting the device shall contact the town electric department with any questions about the connection, disconnection, operation or function of the load management device. 
(7)  Customers that began receiving electric service prior to or on September 1, 1993 that do not have a load management device may request one from the town utilities department. The device shall be furnished by the town and installed free of charge. 
(8)  Customers may opt out of the load management program at any time by notifying the town. Any customer opting out of the program will no longer receive the monthly credits referenced in subsection (4) of this section. Removal of the load management device switch will be at the town's expense for the initial request only. Any future installations or removals following the initial request will be at the customer's expense.

(1)  The replacement charge shall be sufficient to replace any equipment in the sewers or sewage works owned by the town as required, in order to assure the continued peak performance of the equipment and to maintain the capacity for which the sewers and sewage works were designed and constructed. The service life for real and personal property shall be established by the director of public works in cooperation with the town auditors, in accordance with experience of the town, federal guidelines, and accepted accounting procedures. Each piece of equipment shall be evaluated annually to determine whether its useful life has been extended as a result of preventative maintenance programs or repairs. 
(2)  Yearly replacement costs for each piece of equipment shall be separated in accordance with their applicability to flow, BOD, and TSS. This breakdown shall be reviewed annually by the director of public works and approved by the town council. 
(3)  The yearly replacement costs attributable to flow, BOD, and TSS shall be divided by the previous year's total billable flow in 1,000 gallons, billable pounds of BOD and billable pounds of TSS, respectively, and totaled to obtain unit replacement charges. 
(d)  Toxic charges. For each user discharging toxics, the unit charge for toxics described in (b)(2) of this section shall be multiplied by the number of toxics assigned to be monitored by the town. To determine the toxics unit charge, the total cost attributable to all the toxics shall be divided by the total number of toxics assigned to be monitored by the town for the industries monitoring for toxics. 
(e)  Handling and sampling charges. A unit handling charge per bill to cover the cost of billing and collection shall be assessed against each user. The total administrative and overhead costs associated with billing and collection shall be determined by the town manager and assessed against each user; the manager will divide the total administrative and overhead costs by the forthcoming year's estimated total number of bills to be issued. Industrial users shall be charged an additional amount to cover the cost of wastewater monitoring, proportionate to the number of times per year their user class is sampled. This additional amount shall be determined as follows: The monitoring unit charge is obtained by dividing the total nontoxic sampling/analysis costs for all classes of industrial users by the number of industrial users in user class times the number of sampling/analyses per year for that user class. 
(f)  Additional charges. Additional charges shall be billed, as required, for the following: 
(1)  Actual costs incurred for user-requested samplings and analyses. 
(2)  Actual costs incurred for water meter inspection requested by the user or as required because of improper maintenance. 
(3)  Actual costs incurred for special handling not provided for elsewhere in this article. 
(4)  Actual costs incurred for handling a user's check returned because of insufficient funds. 
(Code 1973, § 21-58) 
Sec. 12-44. - Calculating wastewater treatment charges. 
(a)  All users. The basic wastewater treatment bill to be paid by all users shall consist of user charges for operation, maintenance, and replacement, using the unit charges from section 12-43(b) and (c), and user charges for billing and collection as described in section 12-43(e). The unit charges shall be applied to the user's billable flow, BOD, and TSS, respectively, according to the following formula: 
C u = C F + C v (V u ) __________n V t  
where the following definitions shall apply: 
C F 
= ;hg;Total Fixed Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Cost Per Unit of Time 
C V 
= ;hg;Total Variable Operation and Maintenance Cost Per Unit of Time (including Debt Service) 
C u 
= ;hg;A User's Charge for O&M Per Unit of Time 
V u 
= ;hg;Volume Contribution for a User Per Unit of Time 
V t 
= ;hg;Total Volume Contribution from All Users Per Unit of Time 
n 
= ;hg;Total Number of Sewered Customers 
(b)  Industrial and commercial users. 
(1)  In addition to the basic wastewater treatment bill described in subsection 12-43(a) of this section for the user charge system, wastewater treatment bills for industrial and commercial users shall consist of industrial waste monitoring charges and charges for toxics for each user discharging toxics, as described in section 12-43(d). 
(2)  The town shall periodically sample and analyze wastes from selected users in the industrial and commercial user classification to determine the BOD and TSS strengths of the wastes and these results shall be used as representative of wastes from all users in that classification for billing purposes unless the user's waste is classified by the director of public works as having special problems. At the request of the user, samples shall be made and analyzed on the same frequency as samples for the user's classification and that analysis shall be used as typical of that particular user's waste for billing purposes. Industries with wastes classified by the director of public works as having special problems shall, if directed by the director of public works, install, at the industry's own cost and in a structure located on the building service line, whatever sampling devices are required by the director of public works to obtain exact information about the waste. 
(3)  Industrial and commercial users may, at their own expense, install sewer meters, approved as to design and construction by the director of public works. Sewer flow thus metered shall be billable flow. 
(c)  Additional charges. Additional charges as described in section 12-43(f) shall, if required, be listed on the wastewater treatment bill. 
(Code 1973, § 21-59) 
Sec. 12-45. - Use of user charge proceeds. 
(a)  Monies. All user charge monies shall be placed in the sewer fund. Such monies shall be used only to cover the costs of operation and maintenance, replacement, toxics, handling and sampling and other costs as outlined in section 12-43. 
(b)  Expenditures. Expenditures shall be made from the user charge monies by the town manager in accordance with the detailed annual budget and ordinances authorized by the town council. 
(c)  Replacement reserve expenditures. Expenditures from the accrued replacement reserve on facilities shall be for making renewals to accommodate wear of physical elements and/or movable property that would result in an extended useful life or meet the anticipated useful life. 
(d)  Renewals. Renewals to accommodate wear of physical elements and/or movable property shall be capital expenditures that cause the annual estimate for accrued reserves from depreciation and replacement to be evaluated in terms of extended useful life as a result of preventive maintenance programs or of such renewals. The expenditures to overcome physical and/or functional obsolescence shall be capitalized against the element of the facility and charged to the fixed-assets groups of accounts as an improvement to such element. Future estimates of accrued reserve requirements shall be evaluated and reflected in the replacement reserve requirements. 
(e)  Audit. An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant selected by the town council. 
(Code 1973, § 21-62) 
Sec. 12-46. - Wastewater service bills-Periods; payment; delinquent accounts. 
(a)  Bill period. A bill shall be produced and submitted to each sewer user once every month on a billing cycle established by the town. 
(b)  Payment; delinquent accounts. Bills shall be due and payable as are bills for water rents set forth in sections 12-35 through 12-39. Delinquent accounts shall be collected pursuant to G.S. 160A-314.

Sec. 12-47. - Same-Collection of delinquent bills; interest; expenses; disconnection; deposit. 
(a)  Civil action. The town council may, at its discretion, file suit in a civil action to collect such amounts as are delinquent and due against the person legally obligated and shall collect, as well, all attorney's fees incurred by the town in filing the civil action. Such attorney's fees shall be fixed by order of the court. 
(b)  Interest. In addition to all penalties and costs attributable and chargeable to filing a civil action, the person liable shall be liable for interest upon all unpaid balances at the rate of 12 percent per annum. 
(c)  Filing fees. In all cases where the sewer user charge payment has become delinquent, there shall be added to the amount due the town such charges and expenses as are necessary and required to cover the cost of preparation of such notices and forms required to collect the same. In each instance, the town manager or a duly appointed employee of the town shall be authorized and directed to include such additional costs in the amount claimed due the town. 
(d)  Revocation of permits and disconnecting of service. The town council reserved the right to revoke discharge permits and to disconnect service to any user whenever wastewater treatment, or capital surcharge bills become delinquent. 
(e)  Deposit of future payments. All amounts charged under this section continue to be due hereunder, whether or not said sewer is disconnected, and no sewer shall be reconnected until the town is paid in full for all amounts due it, and in addition, there shall be paid to the town a deposit equal to an estimated amount of such charge for the next succeeding year. Such a deposit shall be held by the town in escrow, and will be returned upon satisfactory payment of all bills for a period of two years. 
(Code 1973, § 21-75) 
Sec. 12-48. - Capital reimbursement fees established. 
(a)  Applicability. A capital reimbursement fee shall be imposed with respect to new development to fund costs of capital improvements necessitated by and attributable to such new development and to recoup cost of existing facilities which serve such development. New development is defined as (1) the subdivision of land, (2) the construction, reconstruction, redevelopment, conversion, structural alteration, relocation, or enlargement of any structure which increases the number of service units, or (3) any use or extension of use of land which increases the number of service units. 
(b)  Unit of assessment. Capital reimbursement fees shall be assessed based on meter size using a formula calculated based on a written analysis performed in accordance G.S. Article 8 of Chapter 162A as may be amended from time to time. New developments requiring only water service or only sewer service shall be assessed the capital reimbursement fee based on the meter size associated with that service only. 
(c)  Rate of assessment. The capital reimbursement fee rate shall be as adopted from time to time by the town council in accordance with G.S. Article 8 of Chapter 162A. 
(d)  Procedural effect. Payment of a capital reimbursement fee shall have no effect on the development review and approval process for any proposed project required by the town or by any other government or agency thereof. 
(e)  Time of payment. Capital reimbursement fees must be paid before any of the following: 
(1)  For new development involving a subdivision of land, the capital reimbursement fee shall be collected at the time of plat recordation. 
(2)  All other new development, the capital reimbursement fee shall be collected at the time of application for connection of the development to the service or facilities. 
(f)  Alternate method of paying capital reimbursement fees; guaranteed capacity. An owner may pay capital reimbursement fees prior to the occurrences set out in subsection (e). This payment method shall reserve the capacity for the units paid so long as the town has the capacity requested, in preference to another owner who has not reserved the capacity. Capital reimbursement fees paid based on estimates which later prove to be either excessive or inadequate may be adjusted by the town with fees excessively paid being refunded without interest and with respect to inadequate fees by requiring that additional fees be paid. The prepayment of sewer capital reimbursement fees shall be limited to not more than 30,000 (gpd) in any 12-month period for any given subdivision or development. The 12-month period shall renew on the anniversary date of the council's approval of the subdivision or development plan. A person that has unused prepaid capital reimbursement fees on deposit with the town may request a non-cause based refund of unused prepaid capital reimbursement fees. Determination of whether to grant a non-cause based refund shall be made by the town council. A non-cause refund may be granted if, but only if, the following criteria are met: 
(1)  Granting the refund would not result in hardship to the town or to the fund into which the fees were paid; 
(2)  The funds have been on deposit with the town at least six months. 
(g)  Release from liability. When funds for water or wastewater capacity have been paid as provided in subsection (f), the town shall make such capacity available when required; if, however, the owner is prevented from using the capacity due to no fault of such owner and the town but because of action or laws or regulations of other governments or agencies thereof, or for other acts beyond the control of the owner and town, then the town shall refund the capital reimbursement fees so paid without interest and the town shall have no further responsibility to reserve said capacity. 
(h)  Obligation. Payment of capital reimbursement fees does not relieve the owner of the obligation to build water and sewer line extensions in accordance with town standards. 
(i)  A reimbursement agreement may be entered into between the town and developers consistent with the provisions of the "Policy Regarding Town Participation in Utility Projects" as adopted and amended from time to time by the town council. Such an agreement may be executed by the town manager on behalf of the town. 
(j)  Under exceptional circumstances involving projects of major scope, separate utility contracts may be executed between the town and the developer which may vary from the reimbursement provisions of this section. Prior to entering into a separate utility contract, the town council shall formulate a list of specific findings which indicates the exceptional circumstances that were determined to be present. Examples of factors to be considered in the findings are: number of acres to be served by the project, oversized requirements, distance to treatment facility, strategic location of property to be served, and finding that the property is part of a large, generally undeveloped homogeneous geographical feature such as a drainage basin within the town's water and sewer perimeter area where to construct a utility system under normal reimbursement provisions to serve only the needs of the initial developer would result in the expenditure of large additional sums by the town in paralleling or enlarging the facilities in order to accommodate projected development in the area.

(b)  Requirements to qualify for grant. Any person seeking a grant under this section shall submit an application on a form provided by the water resources department. In order for a grant to be awarded, the following requirements and conditions must be met: 
(1)  Grants shall only be awarded to new or expanded retail businesses that agree to locate or expand in the central business district, to open or complete the expansion within 90 days of the payment of a grant, and to operate there for at least one year; 
(2)  Grants shall only be awarded if the applicant incurs the obligation to pay water/sewer capital reimbursement fees in connection with constructing or renovating a building located in the central business district, in which the new or expanded retail business will be located (the "project"); 
(3)  The applicant must pay 25 percent of the water/sewer capital reimbursement fees which are due; and 
(4)  All renovations of existing buildings shall be in accordance with the standards of the Unified Development Ordinance, Section 6.3.1, the small town character overlay district, and the North Carolina Building Codes. 
(c)  Amount of matching grant. Matching grants under this section shall be in an amount equal to 75 percent of the water/sewer capital reimbursement fees that are due in connection with the construction or renovation of the building in which the new or expanded retail business will be located. 
(d)  Administration of grants. 
(1)  Applications for matching grants shall be processed by the water resources department, and it shall give the applicant a preliminary decision whether the applicant qualifies for the grant and the estimated amount of the grant. The planning director or a designee shall determine whether applications for renovations comply with the renovation standards of the UDO. No building permit shall be issued for a building permit application that does not comply with the renovation standards so long as a grant application is pending for a matching grant related to the project. 
(2)  If an applicant completes the construction or renovation described in the application and meets the requirements of this section, then the water resources department shall give final approval of the grant and calculate its amount. Grants receiving final approval shall not be paid directly to the applicant but shall be paid from the Town of Apex General Fund to the water/sewer fund in satisfaction of 75 percent of the water/sewer capital reimbursement fees due in relation to the applicant's project. The manner of payment shall be by such method as the director of finance deems appropriate. 
(3)  If a recipient of a matching grant fails to meet the recipient's obligation to open and operate the new or expanded retail business as provided in this section, then the matching grant may be revoked. The effect of revoking a matching grant shall be that the portion of the water/sewer capital reimbursement fees satisfied by the grant may be reinstated and that any certificate of occupancy granted in reliance upon the fees having been satisfied through the grant may be revoked. 
(4)  "Central business district" as used herein is defined in Section 12.2 of the UDO. 
(e)  Yearly limits on matching grants. The total of all matching grants awarded in a fiscal year shall not exceed $50,000.00. Within this limit, matching grants shall be awarded on a first come, first served basis determined by the date of application.

Sec. 12-96.8. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
    The town prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes without notification and approval of the POTW director. 
(1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days before the discharge commences. The user shall not begin the discharge until receiving written approval from the town. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 12-96.4 of this division. The notification requirement in this subdivision does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 12-96, 12-96.2, and 12-96.3 of this division. 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (1), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulation under subdivision 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this subdivision, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this division, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(Ord. No. 07-0821-10, § 1, 8-21-07; Ord. No. 2012-0221-03, § 7, 2-21-2012) 
Sec. 12-96.9. - Analytical requirements. 
    All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA and town. Analyses must be performed by a state certified lab for each parameter analyzed, if such certification exists for that parameter.

Sec. 12-96.10. - Grab and composite sample collection. 
(a)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(b)  Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other pollutants, as required by 40 CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the number of grabs necessary to be representative of the user's discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5), for additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and 90-day compliance reports. Additionally, the POTW director may allow collection of multiple grabs during a 24-hour period which are composited prior to analysis as allowed under 40 CFR 136. 
(c)  Composite samples. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected with a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW director. When authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented.

(Ord. No. 2012-0221-03, § 9, 2-21-2012) 
Subdivision 6. - Compliance Monitoring 

Sec. 12-97. - Monitoring facilities. 
(a)  The town requires the user to provide and operate at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the town may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(b)  There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.

Sec. 12-97.1. - Inspection and sampling. 
    The town will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this division is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the town, approval authority and EPA or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The town, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the town, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the town's, approval authority's, or EPA's access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this division. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access. 
(Ord. No. 07-0821-10, § 1, 8-21-07; Ord. No. 2012-0221-03, § 10, 2-21-2012) 
Sec. 12-97.2. - Search warrants. 
    If the town, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the town designed to verify compliance with this division or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the town, approval authority, or EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from the court having jurisdiction within the town. 
(Ord. No. 07-0821-10, § 1, 8-21-07; Ord. No. 2012-0221-03, § 10, 2-21-2012)

All other information which may be submitted by an industrial user to the POTW director in connection with any required reports shall also be available to the public unless the industrial user or other interested person specifically identifies the information as confidential upon submission and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the POTW director that the disclosure of such information or a particular part thereof to the general public would divulge methods or processes entitled to protection as trade secrets. 
(b)  Information provided by an industrial user to the POTW director that is determined to be entitled to confidential treatment shall be made available upon written request to the division of water quality or any state agency for uses related to the pretreatment program, the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, collection system permit, stormwater permit, and/or non-discharge permit, and for uses related to judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. 
(c)  Information and data received by the division or other state agency under subsection (b) above shall be subject to the processes set forth in G.S. 143-215.3C. 
(Ord. No. 07-0821-10, § 1, 8-21-07; Ord. No. 2012-0221-03, § 10, 2-21-2012) 
Subdivision 8. - Enforcement 

Sec. 12-99. - Administrative remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW director finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating this division, wastewater discharge permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained therein or any other pretreatment requirement the POTW director may serve upon such a person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days from the date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the town by the user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The POTW director is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection (d), below. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The POTW director may order any industrial user who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this division or is in noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the POTW director determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
    The POTW director shall review the evidence presented at the hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate. 
    A show cause hearing under this subdivision is not a prerequisite to the assessment of a civil penalty under section 12-99.1 nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW director under this subdivision subject to an administrative appeal under subdivision 10. 
(d)  Administrative orders. When the POTW director finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this division, permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement the POTW director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to do any of the following: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; 
(2)  Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in the order; 
(3)  Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a continuing or threatened violation; 
(4)  Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified time period. 
(e)  Emergency suspensions. The POTW director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater discharge permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit. 
    Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user's wastewater discharge permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the POTW director shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The POTW director shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the POTW director prior to the date of the above-described hearing. 
(f)  Termination of permit or permission to discharge. The POTW director may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
(1)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge; 
(2)  Failure to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
(3)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or 
(4)  Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to discharge, conditions of this division, or any applicable state and federal regulations. 
    Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater discharge permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 12-99.2 of this division why the proposed action should not be taken.

a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (b) of this section. 
(2)  The POTW director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (c)(1) of this section.

ARTICLE VI. - CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL 

Sec. 12-156. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to define the Town of Apex as the water purveyor in the elimination of all cross connections within its public potable water supply. This article shall apply to all consumers connected to the town's public potable water supply. This article will be periodically revised to maintain compliance with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act (P.L. 93-523), the North Carolina State Administrative Code (Title 15A, Subchapter 18C), and the North Carolina Plumbing Code as they pertain to cross connections with the public water supply. In accordance with G.S. 160A-312(b), the town is authorized to adopt "adequate and reasonable rules" to protect and regulate public enterprise systems such as water and wastewater systems. 
(b)  The purposes of this article are as follows: 
(1)  To protect the public potable water supply of the town from the possibility of contamination or pollution by containing within the consumer's water system such contaminants, waterborne health hazards and other significant pollutants which could backflow into the public water systems. 
(2)  To eliminate or control existing cross connections, actual or potential, between the consumer's potable water system(s) and non-potable water system(s), plumbing fixtures and industrial piping systems. 
(3)  To provide a continuing inspection program of cross connection control, which will systematically and effectively control all actual or potential cross connections, which may be installed in the future. 
(Ord. No. 03-0617-05, § 1, 6-17-03) 
Sec. 12-157. - Designation of responsibility. 
(a)  Health agency's responsibility. The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) has the responsibility for promulgating and enforcing laws, rules, regulations, and policies applicable to all water purveyors in the State of North Carolina in carrying out an effective cross connection control program. The division of environmental health has the primary responsibility: for ensuring that the water purveyor operates a public potable water system free of actual or potential sanitary hazards including unprotected cross connections; for ensuring that the water purveyor provides an approved water supply at the service connection to the consumer's water system; and, that the purveyor requires the installation, testing, and maintenance of an approved backflow prevention assembly on the service connection when required. 
(b)  Town of Apex's responsibility. Except as otherwise provided herein, the town is the water purveyor and is responsible for ensuring a safe water supply begins at the source and includes all of the public water distribution system, including the service connection, and ends at the point of delivery to the consumer's water systems. In addition, the town shall exercise reasonable vigilance to ensure that the consumer has taken the proper steps to protect the public potable water system. The town will determine the degree of hazard or potential hazard to the public potable water system, the degree of protection required, and will ensure proper containment protection through an ongoing inspection program. The town will identify all facilities where approved backflow prevention assemblies are required to be installed. When it is determined that a backflow prevention assembly is required for the protection of the public system, the town shall require the consumer, at the consumer's expense, to install an approved backflow prevention assembly at the service connection, to test that backflow prevention assembly immediately upon installation and thereafter at frequency as determined by the town, to properly repair and maintain assembly or assemblies and to keep adequate records of each test and subsequent maintenance and repair, including materials and/or replacement parts. The required testing date will be determined by the town and may be adjusted as necessary. But in no circumstance shall more than one annual test be required in a 12 month time period for lawn irrigation systems. 
(c)  Code enforcement officer's responsibility. The town has the responsibility to not only review building plans and inspect plumbing as it is installed, but they have the explicit responsibility of preventing cross connections from being designed and built into the plumbing system within its jurisdiction. Where the review of building plans suggests or detects the potential for cross connections being made an integral part of the plumbing system, the plumbing inspector has the responsibility, under the North Carolina Plumbing Code, for requiring that such cross connections be either eliminated or provided with backflow prevention equipment approved by the North Carolina Plumbing Code. 
    The inspector will inquire about the intended use of water at any point where it is suspected that a cross connection might be made or where one is actually called for by the plans. When such is discovered it shall be mandatory that a suitable, approved backflow prevention assembly approved by the North Carolina Plumbing Code, North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and the town be required by the plans and be properly installed. 
(d)  Consumer responsibility. The consumer has the primary responsibility of preventing pollutants and contaminants from entering his/her potable water system or the public potable water system. The consumer's responsibility starts at the point of delivery from the public potable water system and includes all of his/her water system. The consumer, at his/her expense, shall install, operate, test, and maintain approved backflow prevention assemblies as directed by the town. The consumer shall maintain accurate records of tests and repairs made to backflow prevention assemblies and shall maintain such records for a minimum period of three years. The consumer shall complete the town backflow prevention assembly survey with every request for a change of business name or occupancy, or when altering any space or system receiving town water. The consumer shall have the certified backflow tester submit the report(s) to the online cross connection control assembly tracking system (online system). Following any repair, overhaul, re-piping, or relocation of an assembly, the consumer shall have that backflow prevention assembly tested to ensure that it is in good operating condition and will prevent backflow. A certified backflow prevention assembly tester shall make tests, maintenance and repairs of backflow prevention assemblies. Failure to submit the test report(s) representing the site to the online system will subject the consumer to the enforcement actions and remedies provided in section 12-166 of this chapter. 
(e)  Certified backflow prevention assembly tester responsibility. When employed by the consumer to test, repair, overhaul, or maintain backflow prevention assemblies, a certified backflow prevention assembly tester (tester) will have the following responsibilities: 
(1)  Each person wishing to test, repair, overhaul, or maintain backflow prevention assemblies shall provide a certificate(s) to the town and the online system which sets forth that he/she has met the minimum qualification standards established by the town for certification as a backflow prevention assembly tester, as outlined in the definition of backflow prevention assembly tester in section 12-158. If at any time the tester(s) certification is revoked, suspended, or flagged as inactive, the tester(s) shall not submit any test report(s) to the town or the online system for approval. The tester(s) shall be considered inactive and subject to enforcement as outlined in section 12-166. 
(2)  The tester will be responsible for making competent inspections and for repairing, or overhauling backflow prevention assemblies and making reports of such repair to the consumer, the town and the online system. The tester shall provide the list of materials or replacement parts used to the online system during the online submittal procedure. The tester shall be equipped with and be competent to use all the necessary tools, gauges, manometers and other equipment necessary to properly test, repair, and maintain backflow prevention assemblies. It will be the tester's responsibility to ensure that original manufactured parts (OEM) are used in the repair of or replacement of parts in a backflow prevention assembly. It will be the tester's further responsibility not to change the design, material or operational characteristics of an assembly during repair or maintenance without prior approval of the town. A tester shall perform the work and be responsible for the competency and accuracy of all tests and reports. The tester shall provide a copy of all test and repair reports to the consumer, online system, and to the town within ten business days of any completed test or repair work. New commercial, domestic, fire and residential irrigation test report(s) that have not been previously recorded by the public works and utilities department shall be submitted to the public works and utilities department within ten days of completion. A tester shall maintain such records for a minimum period of three years. 
(3)  All certified backflow prevention assembly testers must obtain and employ backflow prevention assembly test equipment that has been evaluated and/or approved by the town before registering his or her equipment on the online system. All test equipment shall be registered with the town through the online system. All test equipment shall be checked for accuracy annually (at a minimum), calibrated, if necessary, and certified to the town through the online system as to such calibration, employing an accuracy/calibration method acceptable to the town. 
(4)  Copies of all passing test results shall be entered into the online system and a copy sent to the public works and utilities department. 
(5)  Each backflow tester or individual performing backflow testing within the town jurisdiction shall set up an account in the online system, supplying and maintaining required information pertaining to the testing company, testers, test kits and licenses. Each tester shall create a user name and password to be used on the online system. Each tester or individual shall adhere to all procedural policies and agree to all terms specified in the online system. 
(6)  For each backflow test report submitted by the testing company or individual via the online system, the testing company or individual will be required to pay a filing fee due at the time of submittal. All backflow test reports must be submitted electronically via the online system. The filing fee shall be paid directly to the firm acting as the town's authorized online system provider. The tester may elect to absorb the filing fee for competitive marketing purposes or pass it along to the assembly owner when invoicing for the test. 
(7)  Each backflow test report submitted by the testing company or individual via the online system shall be in a passing state or status. Test reports that fail shall be repaired and be in passing status before submitting to the online system. 
(8)  Only plumbers currently licensed in North Carolina are permitted to repair or replace a backflow prevention assembly. Backflow prevention assembly testers shall comply with all federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations while performing any testing activities in the town.

    Atmospheric type vacuum breaker or nonpressure type vacuum breaker means a device containing a float-check, a check seat, and an air inlet port. The flow of water into the body causes the float to close the air inlet port. When the flow of water stops the float falls and forms a check valve against back siphonage and at the same time opens the air inlet port to allow air to enter and satisfy the vacuum. A shutoff valve immediately upstream may be an integral part of the device. An atmospheric vacuum breaker is designed to protect against a non-health hazard (isolation protection only) under a back siphonage condition only. 
    Auxiliary intake means any piping connection or other device whereby water may be obtained from a source other than the town's public water supply. 
    Auxiliary water supply means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public water supply.

Sec. 17-1. - Planning board-Creation; composition. 
    A town planning board, hereinafter referred to as the "board," is created. It shall consist of eight members. The composition of the board shall reflect proportional representation of the town's extra-territorial jurisdiction. This shall be determined by estimating the population in the town's extra-territorial jurisdiction as a percentage of the population in the combined corporate limits and extra-territorial jurisdiction and multiplying this percentage by the total required regular membership (i.e., eight). The resulting product, rounded up to the nearest whole number, represents the required number of extra-territorial members on the board, appointed by the board of county commissioners of the county. The remainder of the members shall be citizens of the town recommended by the mayor and appointed by the town council. The membership composition shall be periodically adjusted to reflect changes in extra-territorial population. All members of the board shall have voting power on all matters of business. However, any member who is a party at interest to any matter under consideration by the board shall declare such interest prior to a vote of the board on the question and shall abstain from voting on the question. This provision shall not exempt such members from participation in discussions of the board on such matters prior to the vote. Terms of office of all members of the planning board shall be fixed by the town council. Three members shall be appointed for a term of three years, three members shall be appointed for a term of two years, and two members shall be appointed for a term of one year. As the terms of these eight members expire, new appointments for terms of three years shall be made. Vacancies occurring for reasons other than expiration of terms shall be filled as they occur by the town council or the county board of commissioners for the period of unexpired terms. Faithful attendance of the meetings of the board is considered as prerequisite for the maintenance of membership on the board.

2.3.3 Conditional Zoning Districts
A) Purpose
Conditional Zoning (CZ) Districts are zoning districts in which the development and use of property is subject to the predetermined ordinance standards applicable to the corresponding general use district as well as additional rules, regulations, and conditions, that are imposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district. A Conditional Zoning (CZ) District allows particular uses to be established only in accordance with site specific standards and conditions pertaining to each individual development project. All site-specific standards and conditions must be consistent with the objectives of these regulations, the adopted 2045 Land Use Map and adopted area plans. The review process established in this part provides for the accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a Conditional Zoning (CZ) District, subject to site-specific standards and conditions.
B) Uses
Conditional Zoning (CZ) Districts are established (Sec 3.2, Zoning Districts Established, bearing the designation -CZ) to correspond with each of the general use zoning districts. The uses permitted in a Conditional Zoning (CZ) District are, except as limited by the conditions imposed on the district, of the same character or type as the use or uses permitted in the corresponding general use district.

Sec. 2.3.16 / Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District
November 19, 2019 Article 2 - Page 74
F) Standards
1) In return for greater flexibility in site design requirements, the Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ is expected to deliver exceptional quality designs on a large-scale basis that:
a) facilitate the integration of a broad array of uses;
b) preserve and enhance critical environmental and natural resources, including water resources and ecosystem services in the stream network flowing through the district;
c) incorporate creativity in the design and configuration of buildings, roads, public space and infrastructure; and
d) employ innovative techniques and practices aimed at maximizing efficiency in the use of energy and materials.
In short, the Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ is expected to provide a high quality of life through the creation of a healthy, living landscape within a high-intensity mixed-use community.
2) The purpose, intent and scale of the Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ are unique from the other districts established in Sec. 3.2. Thus, the unique nature of the Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ necessitates alternative standards, regulations, specifications, details, designs, and criteria (the Sustainability Standards) to meet the spirit and intent of this Ordinance. These Sustainability Standards, which shall be set forth in the SD Plan and may be established pursuant to paragraph 3) hereafter, may:
a) specify the nature, density, maximums on development, minimums on development, development thresholds, and design characteristics proposed for the Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ;
b) address the relationship between building facades and the public realm, the form and mass of buildings in relation to one another, and the scale and types of streets and blocks;
c) facilitate a full diversity of building types, thoroughfare types, and public space types with appropriate characteristics for their respective locations;
d) facilitate the restoration and enhancement of the environment and natural resources through both accepted practice and innovative practices; and
e) modify and supersede the provisions of this Ordinance or any land development document referenced or incorporated therein, or other land development ordinances or policies of the Town. However, an SD Plan and development pursuant thereto shall conform to all applicable Town ordinances and policies, including the UDO, except to the extent that ordinances or policies, including the UDO, are varied in the approved SD Plan or in Sustainability Standards adopted pursuant to paragraph 3) hereafter. An SD Plan and the Sustainability Standards may not modify the requirement that an SD-CZ District include a minimum of 500 contiguous acres.

At any time, and from time to time:
a) with the consent of the Responsible Person, the Town Council may adopt additional or modified Sustainability Standards for an approved SD-CZ District following review and recommendation by the Planning Board;
b) where an SD Plan requires additional or modified Sustainability Standards for an approved SD-CZ District, site plan approval, subdivision approval, construction or grading shall not commence within such SD-CZ District unless and until the required Sustainability Standards are adopted as provided in the SD Plan; with the consent of the Responsible Person, the Town Council shall review and consider and may adopt such additional and modified Sustainability Standards following review and recommendation by the Planning Board;
c) as an amendment to this Ordinance, the Town Council may adopt elective Sustainability Standards for SD-CZ districts, which may, at the election of a Responsible Person, (i) be incorporated, in whole or in part, into an approved SD Plan for an existing SD-CZ district or (ii) be included within an SD Plan for a proposed SD-CZ district. In the case of an approved SD Plan, the elective Sustainability Standards so incorporated may provide that they serve as a supplement to the provisions of the SD Plan and serve as an alternative to the application of any inconsistent provisions of the Plan;
d) actions by the Town Council under the foregoing subsections 2.3.16(F)(3)(a), (b) and (c) shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 2.3.2 applicable to Amendments to the Text of this Ordinance. It is provided, however, that such actions may be proposed only by the Town Council, the Planning Director, or the Responsible Person; and
e) this Subsection 2.3.16 does not reduce any authority that the Town otherwise has to amend its UDO or an approved SD-CZ rezoning and SD Plan; the vested rights applicable to a SD-CZ rezoning and SD Plan shall be determined by other applicable law and by the provisions of a developer agreement if any.
G) SD Plan
To the degree necessary and appropriate, the SD Plan and the Sustainability Standards shall include, but shall not be limited to, requirements related to:
1) standards a) through d) set forth in the foregoing Section 2.3.16(F)(1);

After final approval of the adopting ordinance for the Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ designation and the SD Plan, the Planning Director shall amend the Official Zoning District Map to show a Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ designation.
I) Effect
Approval of an adopting ordinance for Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ designation and the SD Plan shall constitute an Official Zoning District Map designation and recognition by the Town that the landowner may proceed, consistent with the SD Plan, to develop the land. The next appropriate development approval for the land is a site plan or subdivision plan.
J) Deviation to SD Plan
When appropriate to further the goals of an approved SD-CZ District and its SD Plan, the Planning Director may approve deviations of up to ten percent (10%) with respect to any standard, design, configuration, disposition, or matter established or quantified in an SD Plan or the Sustainability Standards, except that this authority shall not apply to density, maximums on development, minimums on development or thresholds. Any other modification, revision or supplementation of an SD Plan or the Sustainability Standards shall require the approval of the Town Council following review by the Planning Board.
K) Amendment to Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ
An amendment to the Official Zoning District Map for a Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ may be made only pursuant to the procedures and standards for its original approval, and specifically Sec. 2.3.16(D) Unified Ownership or Control.

3.3.4 Other Districts
A) CB Conservation Buffer District
The purpose and intent of the CB Conservation Buffer District is to designate lands that possess unique environmental values that are under public ownership and management.
B) Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District
The purpose and intent of the Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ is to encourage the design of a sustainable community through the application of design approaches that allow and encourage flexibility, an intensity of uses, integration among uses, restoration and enhancement of the environment and natural resources, transit-oriented development, pedestrian-oriented development and the efficient use of resources, energy and materials. This shall be accomplished by allowing design flexibility and innovative approaches to environmental stewardship incorporated in a plan for development that:
1) addresses the relationship between building facades and the public realm, the form and mass of buildings in relation to one another, and the scale and types of streets and blocks;
2) facilitates a full diversity of building types, thoroughfare types, and public space types with appropriate characteristics for their respective locations; and
3) facilitates the restoration and enhancement of the environment and natural resources.
Further, because the aforementioned design standards are best implemented on a large-scale basis, a purpose and intent of the Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ is to provide sufficient lands for such implementation. To this end, the Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ must include a minimum of 500 contiguous acres. An SD-CZ District may include other parcels of any size within 2000 feet of such parcel of at least 500 contiguous acres.
The unique purpose and intent, and the scale and standards to which the development plan must adhere, distinguish the Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ from the other districts established in Sec. 3.2. Therefore, the specific procedures and standards for the review of the Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ are found in Sec. 2.3.16, Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District SD-CZ.
3.3.5 Overlay Districts
A) Watershed Protection Overlay Districts
The purpose and intent of the Watershed Protection Overlay Districts (Primary and Secondary) is to ensure the quality of the public drinking water supplies in the Swift Creek Watershed and the Jordan Lake Watershed are preserved and maintained for present and future residents of the Town and the Triangle region. This is done through the application of land use controls and water quality performance standards to development within each watershed.

B) Flood Damage Prevention Overlay District
The purpose and intent of the Flood Damage Prevention Overlay District is to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas of the Town by provisions designed to:
1) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
4) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and
5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
C) Small Town Character Overlay District
The purpose and intent of the Small Town Character Overlay District is to repeat the spirit of traditional character rather than imitate style. The Overlay identifies the architectural qualities that define the downtown character and proposes design standards to maintain that character in new and infill projects. These standards emphasize existing patterns.

5.2 GENERAL MEASUREMENT REQUIREMENTS
5.2.1 Density
Density shall be measured by taking the quotient of the total number of dwelling units on a site proposed for development divided by the gross acres of the site.
5.2.2 Setbacks
A) Measurement
1) General. Required setbacks shall be measured as the distance between the closer of either the nearest lot line or nearest street right-of-way line and the foundation of a building or structure along a line at right angles to the lot line. Where no minimum front, side, or rear setbacks are specified, the setback line shall be coterminous with the corresponding lot line. Allowable projections into setback areas shall not be utilized for measurement of setbacks. Setbacks shall be established at the time of approval of a Site Plan (Sec. 2.3.6) or Master Subdivision Plan (Sec. 2.3.7.D); the setbacks so established shall continue to apply to the area within the Site Plan or Master Subdivision Plan despite subsequent changes to the setback regulations.

2) Buffer required. Where there is a buffer required pursuant to Sec. 6.1.11 Riparian Buffers or Sec. 8.2.6 Buffering, that buffer shall serve as a setback for all uses in all zoning districts. See Sec. 6.1.11 Riparian Buffers, Sec. 8.1.2.H Setbacks from Resource Conservation Area, Sec. 8.2.6.B.2 Setbacks from Edge of Buffer, and Sec. 8.3.4.C.1 Setbacks for additional setbacks that are required from buffers.
3) No buffer required. Where there is no buffer required pursuant to Sec. 6.1.11 Riparian Buffer or 8.2.6 Buffering, the setback shall be the setback required for the use in Secs. 5.1.1- 5.1.4, whichever is appropriate.

B) General
1) Same lot. Except as specified below, all setbacks allocated to a building or structure shall be located on the same lot as such building or structure.
2) Townhome lots. Attached and detached accessory structures may be located anywhere on the lot as long as they meet all applicable building codes, with the exception of townhomes where the setbacks of accessory structures were established at the time of Site Plan, Subdivision Plan, or PUD approval.
3) Landscape features. Trees, shrubs, flowers, fences, walls, hedges, and other landscape features may be located within any required setback.
4) Encroachments into setbacks. In addition to landscape features, attached accessory structures are allowed to encroach into required setbacks as follows. However, in no case shall any accessory structure be located closer than five (5) feet to a required buffer or other protected areas. Refer to Sec. 5.2.7 Dimensional Standards for Accessory Structures for detached accessory structures.

Figure 5.2.2(B)(4): Illustration of Features that May Encroach Into Required Setbacks
C) Front Setback
1) General. A front setback extends across the full width of a site, the depth of which is the minimum horizontal distance between the front property line and a line parallel thereto on the site.
2) Corner lot. The front setback of a corner lot shall be measured from the side of the lot designated as the front. The front shall be the side where the front door of the building faces.
Article 5 / Measurements
Sec. 5.2 / GENERAL MEASUREMENT REQUIREMENTS
Sec. 5.2.3 / Lot Measurement
November 19, 2019 Article 5 - Page 10
3) Contextual front setback. Regardless of the minimum front setback requirements imposed by this article, applicants shall be allowed to use a contextual front setback. A contextual front setback may fall at a point between the required front setback and the front setback that exists on the lots that are adjacent and oriented to the same street as the subject lot, as long as the contextual setback is compatible and consistent with the setbacks of the adjacent lots. If the subject lot is a corner lot, the contextual setback may fall at any point between the required front setback and the front setback that exists on the lot that is adjacent and oriented to the same street as the subject lot. If lots on either side of the subject lot are vacant, the setback that exists on such vacant lots shall be interpreted as the minimum required front setback that applies to the vacant lot. This provision shall not be interpreted as requiring a greater front setback than imposed by the underlying zoning district, and it shall not be interpreted as allowing setbacks to be reduced to a level that results in right-of-way widths dropping below established minimums.
D) Side Setback
A side setback extends from the rear line of the required front setback, or the front property line of the site where no front setback is required, to the front line of the required rear setback, or the rear property line of the site where no rear setback is required, the width of which is the horizontal distance between the side property line and a line parallel thereto on the site, except that the corner side setback shall extend to the rear lot line.
E) Rear Setback
A rear setback extends across the full width of a site, the depth of which is the minimum horizontal distance between the rear property line and a line parallel thereto on the site, except that on a corner lot the rear setback shall extend only to the side setback abutting the street.
F) Internal Building Setbacks
Except in Sustainable Development Conditional Zoning District (SD-CZ), internal building setbacks for condominium, multi-family and apartment, congregate living facilities and nursing and convalescent facilities shall comply with the following spacing standards:
1) Front to front. Fifty feet from front to front;
2) Side to side. Sixteen feet from side to side;
3) Side to rear. Thirty-three feet from side to rear or rear to side; and
4) Rear to rear. Fifty feet from rear to rear.
5.2.3 Lot Measurement
A) Lot Width
Lot width refers to the horizontal distance between side lot lines. Lot width shall be measured as the distance between the side lot lines as measured at the front building setback line.
B) Average Lot Size
Average lot size refers to the size of single-family lots in the Residential Agricultural (RA), Rural Residential (RR), and Low Density (LD) Districts. The
Article 5 / Measurements

November 19, 2019 Article 5 - Page 11
average size of the lots shall be calculated by taking the total acreage of the area within the residential lots and dividing it by the number of lots.
5.2.4 Height Measurement and Requirements
A) Measurement
Height shall be measured as the vertical distance in feet between the finished floor (not to include finished grade of a basement) to the highest point of the structure at the front elevation.
B) Exceptions to Height Regulations
1) What not to consider in determining height. Cupolas, steeples, domes, flag poles, antennas for which a building permit is not required, chimneys, and roof structures used for ornamental or mechanical purposes, when located on a roof and collectively not exceeding in gross area 30% of the roof area, need not be included in determining the height of a building or structure.
2) Parapet walls. Parapet walls may extend not more than five (5) feet above the allowable height of a building.
3) Contextual height limit. Regardless of the maximum height limit imposed by this Article, a contextual height limit shall be applied. The allowed contextual height may fall at a point between the maximum height limit and the height of the building(s) that exist on a lot that is adjacent to the subject lot, as long as the contextual height is compatible and consistent with the height of the adjacent buildings. If the subject lot is a corner lot, the contextual height may fall at any point between the maximum height limit and the building height that exists on the lot that is adjacent to the subject lot. If lots on either side of the subject lot are vacant, the height that exists on such vacant lots shall be interpreted as the maximum height limit that applies to the vacant lot. This provision shall not be interpreted as requiring greater minimum heights or lower maximum heights. In any event, the height of new development shall comply with height requirements established by the Federal Aviation Administration and codified at CFR Part 77.
5.2.5 Bulk Measurement and Requirements
A) Built-Upon Area
Calculation of the built-upon area within the proposed development shall include, but not be limited to, all existing public and private streets, proposed public streets, sidewalks, driveways, rooftops, parking lots, patios, and all other impervious and partially impervious surfaces, including CABC and gravel within the development. The calculation of built-upon area is expressed as a percentage of total site area. Swimming pools and wooden decks shall not be included in the calculation of the built-upon area.
B) Reserved
5.2.6 Distances
Distances shall be measured on a straight line with no consideration as to intervening structures, roads or other land forms.

ARTICLE 6 OVERLAY DISTRICTS
6.1 WATERSHED PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICTS
6.1.1 Purpose, Authority, and Enactment
The purpose of the Watershed Protection Overlay Districts is to ensure the availability of public water supplies at a safe and acceptable level of water quality, to ensure protection of public water supplies for recreational and aesthetic purposes, to minimize sedimentation of streams, and to protect the environment, health, and general welfare of present and future residents of the Town and the Triangle Region under the authority set forth in Sec. 1.2 Authority of this Ordinance and in NCGS 160A-174. In addition, the Legislature of the State of North Carolina has, in Chapter 143, Article 21 of the North Carolina General Statutes, entitled Water and Air Resources, directed local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare pursuant to the more specific requirements set forth in 15A NCAC 2B .0100, 15A NCAC 2B .0200, and in the Jordan Water Supply Watershed Nutrient Management Strategy Rules, 15A NCAC 2B .0262 through .0273 and .0311(p). Also pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, federal Phase II Stormwater rules promulgated under it, and NCGS 143-215.1 and S.L. 2006-246, the Town is required to obtain a Phase II National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for stormwater management for its municipal separate storm sewer system and to adopt, among other things, requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. (Additional specific purposes may be found in the Swift Creek Land Management Plan and the 2045 Land Use Map Update.) In furtherance of these goals and under such authorities, the Town of Apex promulgated this Sec. 6.1 Watershed Protection Overlay Districts.
6.1.2 Primary and Secondary Watershed Protection Overlay Districts
Except for those lands and uses exempted pursuant to Sec. 6.1.3 Exemptions, the Watershed Protection Overlay Districts shall encompass all lands within the Town of Apex and its extraterritorial jurisdiction as established in Sec. 1.2.2 Authority to Regulate Zoning, Subdivision And Building Practices in ETJ. The boundaries for the Towns extraterritorial jurisdiction area (hereinafter ETJ) are delineated on the Town of Apexs Official Zoning District Map. A copy of this map shall be on record in the office of the Town Clerk and in the Planning Department for inspection by the general public during normal business hours.
The Town and its ETJ shall be divided into two (2) districts for the purpose of watershed protection. The Primary Watershed Protection District shall consist of all lands identified by the state as water supply watershed protected areas. The Secondary Watershed Protection District shall consist of the remainder of lands within the Town and its ETJ. These two (2) districts shall be identified on the Town of Apexs Watershed Protection Overlay District Map. A copy of this map shall be on record in the office of the Town Clerk and in the Planning Department for inspection by the general public during normal business hours. All subsequent changes to the area that is identified by the state as water supply watershed protected area are herein adopted by reference, and the Planning Department shall cause such changes to be reflected on said map. A portion of the Jordan Lake Watershed, which consists of all lands and waters draining to the B. Everette Jordan Reservoir, is located within the Towns Primary Watershed Protection District and a portion is located within the Secondary Watershed Protection District as also depicted on the Towns Watershed Protection Overlay District Map.
The Town shall also maintain a Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) Map of the Town and its ETJ that depicts the geographic location of all the SCMs approved under Sec. 6.1

D) Appeals of Stream Classification
Because the Neuse River is protected by a state-wide buffer program, which is managed by the NC DEQ, the authority to hear appeals of stream classifications for that portion of the Town of Apex and its ETJ that lies within the Neuse River Basin, which shall be indicated on the Town of Apexs Watershed Protection Overlay District Map, rests within the sole jurisdiction of the NC DEQ unless the Town of Apex is delegated the authority to maintain its Neuse Buffer Program locally. Therefore, appeals of stream classifications shall be handled in the following manner:
1) Within the Neuse River Basin
When any affected party within the Neuse River Basin believes that the maps have inaccurately depicted surface waters, he or she shall consult the NC DEQ as set forth in 15A N.C.A.C. 2B.0233(3).
In the event that the Town of Apex is delegated the authority to maintain Neuse buffers locally, the Stormwater and Utility Engineering Manager shall make decisions and interpretations regarding stream classifications in accordance with all applicable state criteria and the best available scientific information. Any disputes over such on-site determination shall be referred to the Director of the NC DEQ in writing. A determination of the Director as to the accuracy or application of the maps is subject to review as provided in Articles 3 and 4 of G.S. 150B.
2) Within the Jordan Lake Watershed
When any affected party within the Jordan Lake Watershed believes that the maps have inaccurately depicted surface waters, the Stormwater and Utility Engineering Manager, or his or her designee, shall make decisions and interpretations regarding stream classifications in accordance with the protocol in Sec. 6.1.11.D.4 and all applicable state criteria and the best available scientific information. Any disputes over such on-site determination made by the Town of Apex shall be referred to the Director of the NC DEQ in writing.

E) Standards
1) General. The standards set forth in Sec. 6.1.13.E.2-3 shall be applicable to all variance requests submitted to the Board of Adjustment, except for a request submitted pursuant to the alternative variance process in Sec. 6.1.13.F.
2) The Board of Adjustment shall make a finding of fact as to whether there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that prevent compliance with the requirements at issue. A finding of practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships shall require that the following conditions are met:
a) If the applicant complies with the requirements at issue, he/she can secure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, his/her property. Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit from the property shall not be considered adequate justification for a variance. Moreover, the Board of Adjustment shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from applicable requirements that shall make reasonable use of the property possible;
b) The practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships result from application of Sec. 6.1 to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship;
c) The practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships is due to the physical nature of the applicants property, such as its size, shape, or topography, such that compliance with Sec. 6.1 would not allow reasonable use of the property;
d) The applicant did not cause the practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships by knowingly or unknowingly violating Sec. 6.1;
e) The applicant did not purchase the property after the effective date of Sec. 6.1, and then request a variance; and
f) The practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships are rare or unique to the applicants property.
3) The Board of Adjustment shall also make findings of fact as to:
a) whether the variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Towns Watershed Protection Overlay Districts and preserves its spirit; and
Article 6 / Overlay Districts
Sec. 6.1 / WATERSHED PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICTS
Sec. 6.1.13 / Modifications by Variance

b) whether in granting the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured, water quality has been protected, and substantial justice has been done.
F) Alternative Process and Standards for Variance From Density Requirements in Secondary Watershed Protection District and/or From Impacts to Town Buffers
1) An applicant seeking a variance from the density requirements in Sec. 6.1, which may include stormwater management requirements, for a project located in the Secondary Watershed Protection District, and/or from buffer requirements applicable to a Town Buffer as defined in Sec. 6.1.14.C.1, may elect to, but is not required to, seek such variance pursuant to the process and standards set forth in this Sec. 6.1.13.F. The purpose of this alternative variance process is to provide additional design flexibility for a project that provides a unique or additional benefit to the Town or surrounding area that would not be available from a traditional development in areas where the applicable Ordinance requirements are not part of a State authorized program or where separate State rules do not apply.
2) The Board of Adjustment shall make a finding of fact as to whether there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that prevent compliance with the requirements at issue. A finding of practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships shall require that the following conditions are met:
a) the project provides a unique or additional benefit to the Town or surrounding area that would not be available from a traditional development;
b) the strict application of the requirements of Sec. 6.1 create practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships;
c) the practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships result from the application of Sec. 6.1 to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship;
d) the applicant did not cause the practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships by knowingly or unknowingly violating Sec. 6.1;
e) the development plan for which the variance is sought (including specific proposed mitigation) provides an overall level of environmental protection that meets or exceeds that provided by the requirements in Sec. 6.1, including consideration of stormwater management, nutrient removal and stream and other surface water protection functions, sedimentation, and downstream water quality and quantity.
3) The Board of Adjustment shall also make findings of fact as to:
a) whether the variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Towns Watershed Protection Overlay Districts and preserves its spirit; and

6.3 SMALL TOWN CHARACTER OVERLAY DISTRICT
6.3.1 Small Town Character Overlay District
A) Purpose
The purpose and intent of the Small Town Character Overlay District is to repeat the spirit of traditional character rather than imitate style. The Overlay identifies the architectural qualities that define the downtown character and proposes design standards to maintain that character in new and infill projects. These standards emphasize existing patterns and include: building hierarchy, building site relationship, and building massing and proportions. For multi-family and non-residential uses, this also includes building height and roof type, façade patterns, street level facades, and window patterns.
B) Applicability
The requirements of the Small Town Character Overlay District shall apply to properties within the Overlay District which are proposing to develop or redevelop. Those lots that are split by the Overlay District line shall be considered to be wholly within the boundary of the Overlay District if the majority of the acreage is located within the Overlay District.
C) Development Approval
Within the Small Town Character Overlay District either an Administrative Approval, Site Plan Approval, or Subdivision Plan Approval is required in accordance with Article 2 Administration.
D) Approval Criteria
The standards in Sec. 6.3.1 and the following criteria must be met before an Administrative Approval, Subdivision Approval, or Site Plan Approval will be issued for properties within the Small Town Character Overlay District:
1) The proposed land use must be allowed in the underlying zoning district found in Sec. 4.2.2 Use Table.
2) All Watershed Protection Overlay District and Flood Damage Overlay District requirements must be met.
3) The maximum built-upon area, height, setbacks and minimum lot width, must be in compliance with the Sec. 5.1.5 Table of Intensity and Dimensional Standards.
4) Garage placement must be in compliance with Sec. 6.3.G.2 below.
5) If land is to be subdivided, all requirements of Article 7: Subdivision and Article 14: Parks, Recreation, Greenways, and Open Space shall be met.
6) No Resource Conservation Area (Sec. 8.1.2 Resource Conservation Area) or Buffers (Sec. 8.2.6 Buffering) are required.
7) All multi-family and non-residential development shall be compatible with the established architectural character of the neighborhood by using a design that is complementary to existing neighborhood architectural styles, designs, and forms. Compatibility shall be achieved through techniques such as the repetition of roof lines, the use of similar proportions in building mass and outdoor spaces, similar relationships to the street, similar window and door patterns, and the use of building

Corner buildings shall match or exceed the height of adjacent buildings. The two facades shall be acknowledged with consistent material and patterns. Projects with public or cultural significance shall be designed to have a character that varies more from the standard pattern to distinguish them as a signature or landmark structure.
2) Setbacks
No setback is required and a maximum 10 foot front setback shall provide for a pedestrian street edge. The building shall be placed to maintain the street edge. The relationship of the building to the street edge shall emphasize the pedestrian not the automobile. Pedestrian spaces such as sidewalk dining or shaded seating are encouraged. Whenever possible, required parking and open space shall be maintained in the rear or sides of a building.
3) Building Tenant Size
Buildings shall not have a single tenant which exceeds 30,000 square feet.
4) Massing and Proportion
Buildings shall have vertical proportions. Segments shall be no more than 60 feet in width and each section taller than it is wide. Windows and storefront glazing shall be divided to be either square or vertical in proportion so that each section is taller than it is wide. Permitted setbacks can be used to articulate bays of a building to break up its width. Architectural features such as but not limited to columns, piers, rooflines, and brick patterns can be used to divide and create vertical orientation on building facades. In addition, infill projects shall be designed in accordance with Sec. 9.2.4(D) Similar Size and Height for Infill Development.
5) Building Height and Roof Type
Buildings in the downtown district have traditionally used straight-edged parapets with low-slope roofs behind.

4) The width of the façade shall not be any wider than 1.5 feet times the depth of the principal structure. The width to depth ratio shall be no more than 1.5 feet to 1 foot.
5) No slab-on-grade foundations are permitted. Foundations around the principal structure shall be fully enclosed.
H) Residential Architectural Character
The following standards shall apply to any condominium, multi-family or apartment use. It is strongly recommended that single-family and townhouse dwellings follow the architectural guidelines in the Town of Apex Design and Development Manual.
1) Purpose
Architectural character focuses on the micro-level details that greatly affect the overall appearance of residential structures in the small town character overlay district. These architectural character regulations provide direction in aspects of facade materials, porches, windows, and the enhancement of entryways. The primary goal is to define the finishing touches that provide the structure with a sense of permanence, style, and compatibility. The Town actively discourages proposals that have not taken these matters into account. The Town desires that all development be treated as a lasting contributor to the community and as a good neighbor to its surroundings. New construction, exterior renovations or additions to the front façade, or renovations of 50% or more of the entire façade are subject to this section. New construction, additions, and significant exterior renovations of an existing residential structure must be compatible with the character of quality structures located in the Small Town Character Overlay District.
2) Standards
These standards shall apply to all new construction, exterior renovation or additions to the front façade or to renovations of 50% or more of the entire façade. The Town of Apex Design and Development Manual includes illustrated renderings of the architectural and decorative features required by these standards for residential structures in the Small Town Character Overlay District.

Adaptive Reuse maintains the character of the structures, while allowing for modifications to the structure for a different use. Certain structures, due to particular circumstances with regard to locations, type or size of building and/or architectural style may no longer be useful for the purposes for which they were originally designed and designated. Obsolescence of previous use, changing land use patterns or changing of zoning districts may initiate the change from one use to another.
2) Applicability
Change of use in all contributing structures originally constructed as residences within the boundaries of the National Register of Historic Places Historic District. All noncontributing structures constructed as residences within the boundaries of the National Register of Historic Places Historic District are subject to this ordinance, but are exempt from Secs. 6.3.1(I)(2)(a) and 6.3.1(I)(2)(h).
a) The following standards are to be applied to specific rehabilitation projects in a practical and reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility. The structure shall not be enlarged or the exterior altered so that it is out of character with the surrounding structures and any altered structure shall meet the Secretary of the Interior Standards for Rehabilitation:
(i) A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships.
(ii) The historic character of a property will be retained and
Article 6 / Overlay Districts
Sec. 6.3 / SMALL TOWN CHARACTER OVERLAY DISTRICT
Sec. 6.3.1 / Small Town Character Overlay District
November 19, 2019 Article 6 - Page 74
preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided.
(iii) Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, will not be undertaken.
(iv) Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved.
(v) Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved.
(vi) Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence.
(vii) Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used.
(viii) Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.
(ix) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction will not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment.
(x) New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
b) Distinctive landscaping elements and existing topographic features shall not be removed or altered so as to change the visual and environmental character of the site except in cases where site modification and improvements for parking, loading, or access require the removal of trees or shrubbery. In such cases, replacement landscaping shall be installed where possible adjacent to the modified area.

The gate shall be owned and maintained by the Town of Apex. The regulation of, use of, and access through a gate constructed in accordance with this section, and the removal thereof, shall be governed by Chapter 20 of the Apex Town Code of Ordinances or other appropriate police power ordinances or actions.
L) Traffic Calming
1) No development proposal shall be permitted to provide for the installation of traffic calming measures in an adjacent or nearby existing neighborhood unless the street(s) meet the criteria in Sec. 7.2.1.L.3 of this Ordinance.
2) All new residential developments shall provide for the installation for traffic calming measure(s) on each residential street within the development where the length of the public street exceeds 1,000 feet. The location and type of traffic calming measure(s) shall be determined by the Planning Department and Public Works and Transportation Department. Traffic calming measure(s) include but are not limited to traffic circles, roundabouts, curb extensions, chicanes, splitter islands, and designated on-street parking. Speed humps are only allowed as traffic calming measures in existing neighborhoods that meet the criteria in Sec. 7.2.1.L.3 of this Ordinance.
3) This section replaces the Town of Apex Traffic Calming Device Policy and Guidelines. The Town may install and maintain traffic calming devices on Town-maintained streets directly serving residential driveways where speeding vehicles are the primary concern. The following procedures are meant to ensure that traffic calming devices are installed and used as intended for the appropriate and consistent treatment on Town-maintained streets and receive the support of the affected neighborhood. Traffic calming devices are limited to vertical and/or horizontal changes in the vehicular travelway that may or may not involve adjustments to existing curb. Stop and yield signs are defined as traffic control devices and are not appropriate for use as traffic calming devices. Stop and yield signs are however subject to engineering evaluation by the Towns Transportation Engineer according to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Traffic calming requests are subject to the following qualifying criteria:
Article 7 / Subdivision
Sec. 7.2 / DESIGN STANDARDS
Sec. 7.2.1 / Streets
November 19, 2019 Article 7 - Page 10
a) Streets on which traffic calming devices are requested must be residential and exhibit all of the following characteristics:
(i) Posted speed is 25 miles per hour;
(ii) Roadway is not a Collector Street or Thoroughfare;
(iii) The average speed exceeds 30 miles per hour during any one-hour period in which the number of vehicles meets or exceeds 100. The data collected to determine average speed may be based on an average of 100 vehicles per hour or more over multiple days; and
(iv) Installation of traffic calming devices along the street is not anticipated to create unacceptable delays in emergency response times for residences served by the street in the judgment of the Towns Police Chief and Fire Chief.
b) The request must be initiated, accepted, and supported by the property owners within the affected residential neighborhood:
(i) The requesting party must submit a request to the Transportation Engineer. Requests for traffic calming devices at a particular location are limited to one request within a 24 month period. Upon consultation with the Towns Police Department, the Transportation Engineer may request a study be conducted or inform the requesting party that the location is not a candidate for traffic calming measures based on the Towns criteria. If requested, the Towns Police Department will conduct a traffic speed and volume survey and provide the results to the Transportation Engineer who will determine whether all criteria in Sec. 7.2.1.L.3 are satisfied.
(ii) If all the required criteria in Sec. 7.2.1.L.3 are met, the Transportation Engineer will notify the requesting party and homeowners association (if one exists), develop a sketch plan reflecting the types and locations of the proposed traffic calming devices, and prepare a petition boundary area. The petition boundary area shall include, at a minimum, all lots adjacent to the street within the subdivision where traffic calming devices are proposed along with all cul-de-sac streets and loop streets dependent on that street for connectivity. Once the homeowners association is provided the sketch plan and petition boundary area, the association shall have 30 calendar days to either vote against the plan in order to end the process or vote to proceed, either with the association voting to administer a petition to the Transportation Engineer or the association delegating that authority to the original requesting party. In either event, the association shall notify the Transportation Engineer of the vote. If the homeowners association takes no action or fails to notify the Transportation Engineer of the outcome of the vote within 30 calendar
Article 7 / Subdivision
Sec. 7.2 / DESIGN STANDARDS
Sec. 7.2.1 / Streets
November 19, 2019 Article 7 - Page 11
days of being provided the sketch plan and petition boundary area then the requesting party may proceed with the petition. The requesting party and homeowners association may provide Town staff with input concerning the desired types and locations of the proposed traffic calming devices, but the final decision as to all elements of the sketch plan (including but not limited to the types and locations of the proposed traffic calming devices) shall be solely within the engineering judgment of Town staff.
(iii) The requesting party or homeowners association for the affected residential neighborhood must provide the Town with a completed petition as noted in Sec. 7.2.1.L.3.b.ii with at least 70% agreement from homeowners within the petition boundary area no later than six (6) months following the date of the traffic survey. Each signature line shall include the printed and signed name of at least one (1) of the deed holders for the residential property, the address, and date signed.
(iv) The requesting party or homeowners association must pay the Town 20% of the estimated cost of installing the requested traffic calming devices as reflected in the sketch plan prior to the request being scheduled for consideration by the Town Council. If the Town Council does not approve the plan then the 20% cost share shall be refunded.
(v) The Town Council will consider a petition to remove traffic calming devices on Town-maintained streets upon receipt of a petition signed by at least 70% of the owners of lots within the petition boundary area as noted in Sec. 7.2.1.L.3.b.ii. In the absence of a previously defined petition boundary area the Transportation Engineer shall prepare a new petition boundary area. The homeowners association may proceed with a petition to remove traffic calming devices at any time or delegate that authority to a requesting party. In the absence of a homeowners association or if no action is taken by the homeowners association within 30 calendar days of receiving a request the requesting party may proceed with a petition. If a removal petition is submitted at any time within five (5) years from the date of installation thereof, the requesting party or homeowners association must pay the Town (in advance of removal) 100% of the estimated cost of removing such device(s); provided, however, that nothing shall limit or otherwise impair the Towns discretion to remove, at the Towns initiative, any traffic calming device on Town-maintained streets.
After all of the criteria have been satisfied, the Town Council will make the final decision whether to approve the proposed installation/removal project. The Town Council reserves the right to deny any request for installation/removal of traffic calming devices on Town-maintained streets, in its sole discretion. After the project has been approved by the

C) Sidewalks
1) This section replaces the Towns Sidewalk Policy adopted April 7, 1992 and subsequent Amendment to Sidewalk Policy adopted September 7, 1993.
2) The subdivider shall construct sidewalks along both sides of all major and minor thoroughfares, all collectors, and on one side of all other streets within and bordering the subdivision property boundaries. Such sidewalks shall provide direct pedestrian connections to adjacent properties outside the subdivision.
a) Consideration will be given to a greenway in lieu of some or all sidewalks within a development if an equal or better pedestrian system will be provided.
b) Where street interconnectivity is not provided (such as but not limited to cul-de-sacs) within the development plan, pedestrian connections shall be constructed. The pedestrian connection requirement does not apply when a connection between two (2) cul-de-sacs would not improve connectivity with the subdivision or to surrounding areas as determined by the Planning Director. The pedestrian connection shall be constructed according to the following:
(i) The developer shall construct the required pedestrian connections within open space or Resource Conservation Area owned by a homeowners association, using a minimum five-(5) foot width instead of the 10-foot wide standard section for concrete greenways;
(ii) The developer shall provide a 10-foot wide public access and maintenance easement along these paths, with the paths in the center of the easements;
(iii) The open space shall be provided between lots (not within lots) to maintain pedestrian connectivity and shall include destination and directional signs;
(iv) Where necessary to cross a stream or creek, the developer shall construct a bridge with a minimum path width of six (6) feet across the bridge; and

(v) In low-lying areas, the Planning Director may require that the developer construct a boardwalk.
3) The Planning Director may recommend exceptions to this general requirement for areas within a subdivision that are not reasonably expected to draw a significant amount of pedestrian traffic, such as but not limited to:
a) The bulb portion of a cul-de-sac, provided that the sidewalk connects to other cul-de-sacs, roads, amenities and greenways and a sidewalk is still provided up the neck portion of the cul-de-sac where 10 or more dwelling units border the cul-de-sac.
b) If a topographic or natural feature makes construction of a sidewalk impractical (as determined by the Planning Director).
c) If a subdivision is of rural nature such that the density is equal to or less than one (1) dwelling unit per acre and have streets without curb and gutter.
4) Where a sidewalk is required on one side of the street, the following criteria will be considered in determining which side of the street the sidewalk will be located:
a) The side that would link with an existing sidewalk(s).
b) The side what would link a greenway, park, shopping area, or school.
c) Where there are no existing sidewalks for linkage, Planning staff will evaluate the length of the street for slope, existing conditions, and any other special conditions that may affect sidewalk installation. Planning staff will recommend to the TRC as to which side of the street would be most appropriate for the sidewalk.
5) All installation of sidewalks shall conform to the Town of Apex Standard Specifications and Standard Details.
6) For existing sites that are proposed for re-development items 1-5 will apply at the discretion of the Planning Director.

The Peakway shall be constructed and right-of-way dedicated in accordance with current standards of the Town of Apex.
Article 7 / Subdivision
Sec. 7.5 / REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
Sec. 7.5.4 / Streets
November 19, 2019 Article 7 - Page 24
3) Posted Speed/Design Speed
Refer to the Town of Apex Standard Specifications and Standard Details for width and pavement structure requirements.
4) Order of Construction
Because of expected low traffic counts early in the life of the facility, two travel lanes with curb and gutter and sidewalk are to be constructed initially with grading for the remaining roadway width when adequate public right-of-way is available. First priority of construction shall be the outer two travel lanes. In constructing only the outer two lanes, the inside curb shall be constructed as median curb.
a) Development on Outside of Road Corridor
One-half of the right-of-way shall be dedicated and the outside two lanes and sidewalk shall be built as specified above.
b) Development on Inside of Road Corridor
When property develops on the inside of the corridor and the outer lanes have already been constructed, the remaining one-half (½) right-of-way shall be dedicated and an approved connection shall be made to the outer lanes. A fee in lieu shall be paid for construction of the inside lanes and multi-use path.
If the outer lanes have not been constructed and the developer has access to the property through an existing road, then the Town may consider accepting the dedication of one half (½) of the right-of-way and a fee-in-lieu of construction. If the outer lanes have not been constructed but the only access to the property being developed is the Peakway, then the developer shall make the necessary arrangements to have the right-of-way dedicated and the outside lanes constructed and may be required to dedicate the right-of-way and pay a fee in lieu of construction of the inside lanes. In a situation where it may be possible to build the inside lanes and transition from the outside lanes to the inside lanes meeting forty (40) mph roadway design guidelines, then the Town may consider allowing the developer to dedicate the right-of-way and build the inside lanes instead of the outside lanes.
c) Development of Both Sides of the Road Corridor
If the owner develops property on both sides of the corridor, the full right-of-way shall be dedicated with construction of the outer two lanes, curb and gutter and sidewalk as specified above. The property owner shall also provide grading for the remaining half of the roadway.
5) Median Cross-Over Spacing/Access
Future median cross-overs are to be a minimum of 500 feet apart. The distance as provided in this subsection also applies to allowable offsets from existing State-maintained or other municipal roadways. Right-in/right-out access may be considered between median cross-overs, but no less than two hundred (200) feet from a cross-over or other adjacent right-in/right-out access.

6) Residential Lot Access
No residential lot access shall be allowed other than a lot of record prior to the adoption of this policy.
7) Buffers
Properties that are adjacent to the Peakway shall provide a buffer in accordance with Sec 8.2.6 Buffering. The buffer planting plan shall be submitted as a part of the master subdivision or site plan approval process. Protection of existing vegetation is encouraged where this vegetation is significant. The reservation of the buffer must be noted on the final plat. The maintenance of the buffer shall be the responsibility of the property owner.
8) Streetscape Landscaping
Streetscape landscaping requirements would be as prescribed by the Landscape Ordinance for all developments required to file a site plan.
E) Public Access Requirements
A residential development or any portion thereof shall (either by itself or in combination with another existing development through which it accesses the public street system) propose no more than 50 single-family units, 100 multi-family units, or 50 units of single-family and multi-family combined unless it is served by at least two (2) points of access to the public street system. When more than one (1) point is required, one (1) of those two (2) points must be a full-movement intersection and both points of access must be constructed to Town of Apex standards. A stub street allowing for future connectivity but not being extended to the public street system in conjunction with the proposed development cannot be considered a point of access. The points of access serving the development shall be separated by a minimum distance of 500 feet. The spacing between points of access is subject to approval by the North Carolina Department of Transportation if the access is proposed along a state-maintained roadway. Any residential development exceeding 300 residential units shall provide at least three (3) points of access to the public street system. Construction of a Major Collector or Thoroughfare on the Town of Apex Transportation Plan can provide opportunities for additional points of access when the existing roadway frontage cannot provide those opportunities. See also Sec. 7.2.1.A.2 Points of ingress/egress.
F) Stub Street Fee-In-Lieu
When a public street stub is included in an approved site plan and cannot be constructed within 10 feet of the property line due to environmental constraints, a fee-in-lieu shall be paid for future completion of the street stub and utilities to the property line.
1) The fee-in-lieu shall be based on an engineers estimate of actual quantities of clearing and grubbing, grading, drainage structures, water and sewer lines, concrete curb and gutter, sidewalk, and paving required to complete the remainder of the street section to the property line. The fee-in-lieu shall also include the appropriate share of the engineers estimate of permitting fees.
2) In the event of a stream crossing and/or if a bridge is anticipated, the fee-in-lieu shall include the appropriate share of the crossing which may not be exactly half of the estimated total monetary cost of the crossing due to
Article 7 / Subdivision
Sec. 7.5 / REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
Sec. 7.5.5 / Required Landscaped Median

differences in elevation between the two sides of the creek and location of the property line with respect to the centerline of the creek.
3) The fee-in-lieu shall be due prior to platting of the portion of the site plan that includes the street stub.
4) If and when the adjacent property is proposed for development, the adjacent site plan will include completion of the street and the developer of the adjacent site shall receive the full balance of the fee-in-lieu upon completion of the street.
5) If for any reason the first developer has not paid a fee-in-lieu and platted their portion of the street at the time the adjacent (second) developer is prepared to plat their portion of the street to the property line, the Town may make the fee-in-lieu option available to the adjacent developer provided the first developer is given notice.
6) In the event the adjacent developer pays a fee-in-lieu for their portion prior to platting, the first developer would then be responsible for connection of the street prior to platting.
7.5.5 Required Landscaped Median
At the main entrance to any Low Density (LD), Medium Density (MD), or Planned Unit Development (PUD) District subdivisions containing 50 or more lots, there shall be a landscaped median containing trees. There shall be a 15 wide back of curb to back of curb landscaped median for large trees or an 8 wide back of curb to back of curb landscaped median for small trees. Large trees shall have at least 350 square feet of non-paved area around the trunk, and small trees shall have at least 250 square feet of non-paved area around the trunk. Trees shall be selected from the Town of Apex Design and Development Manuals recommended tree list.

ARTICLE 8 GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
8.1 RESOURCE CONSERVATION
8.1.1 General
A) Purpose
Protection of the Towns existing natural and cultural resources is intended to preserve the visual and aesthetic qualities of the Town; to encourage site design techniques that preserve the natural and cultural environment and enhance the developed environment; to control erosion, slippage, and sediment run-off into streams and waterways; to increase slope stability; and to protect wildlife habitat and migration corridors.
B) Applicability
These resource conservation standards shall apply to all new development in the Town, except for development on lots of record that were approved for single-family residential use prior to the effective date of this UDO.
C) Structure of this Section
This Section 8.1 requires applicants for development in the Town to protect a variety of types of sensitive natural and cultural resources. The Resource Conservation Area (RCA) provisions of Sec. 8.1.2 require delineation of a protected area for every development site, and provide a general framework within which other, more specific types of protection must take place. Subsequent sections (8.1.3 through 8.1.4) provide specific rules for protecting specific types of resources.
8.1.2 Resource Conservation Area
A) Establishment of RCA
RCA required. For every development subject to administrative approval, Site Plan review, Master Subdivision Plan review, and/or planned development plan review, the applicant shall propose, and the Planning Director shall establish, a resource conservation area (RCA) according to the criteria set forth below. The plan shall indicate the specific area(s) of a lot, lots, or site to be protected (the RCA), outside of which the developed project (including buildings, accessory structures, driveways, parking, and private utilities) and all development activity shall be contained. The landscaping of non-vegetated RCA is governed by Sec. 8.2.3.C.3 and the Town of Apex Design and Development Manual.
1) Off-site RCA. RCA may be established outside of the limits of the development site provided that the Town Council finds through a quasi-judicial public hearing that all of the following criteria are met by the off-site RCA:
a) The area must include one or more of the RCA categories listed in 8.1.2.B.1.
b) The area must be located within the Town of Apexs corporate limits or extra-territorial jurisdiction.
c) The area must be 1) located directly adjacent to existing RCA, existing public parks, existing conservation easements, or other publicly held land with environmental preservation or wildlife

habitat preservation as its primary function (such as wetland mitigation), or 2) be a minimum size of two (2) acres and a minimum width of 30 feet.
d) The provision of off-site RCA shall be provided at a rate of 1.5 times the on-site RCA. However, the on-site RCA cannot be reduced more than 50% through the provision of off-site RCA.
e) The off-site RCA must be deeded to the Town of Apex or another qualified land management agency, such as but not limited to the Triangle Land Conservancy.
B) Criteria for Establishing RCA
In establishing the RCA, the Planning Director shall take into account the criteria listed below:
1) Categories of RCA:
a) Undisturbed floodplains, floodways, flood fringes, and flood hazards.
b) Undisturbed riparian streams, wetland protection, and riparian buffering.
c) Undisturbed steep slopes equal to or greater than 3:1 (30%) and other erosion prevention and control measures, including, but not limited to, protection of natural drainage channels.
d) Preservation of undisturbed forested areas (including trees less than 18 caliper in size), or individual significant trees 18 caliper and larger.
e) Undisturbed significant wildlife and plant habitat areas.
f) Preservation of other significant site elements such as, but not limited to, historic and cultural sites and structures, scenic views, farm ponds, rock outcroppings, and cemeteries.
g) Private recreation area, including but not limited to, privately-owned play lawns, open space, pools, tennis courts, tot lots, ball fields, and village greens shall be allowed to be counted as partial credit toward the RCA requirement. In order to qualify as RCA, the private recreation area must be located on a lot .3 acre or larger in size. The credit for the private recreation area shall be 50% of the acreage provided in the private recreation area. (For example, 1 acre of private recreation area counts as .5 acre of RCA).
h) Solar panels and all associated equipment when installed on the dam of a SCM.
i) When an insufficient amount of RCA in categories 8.1.2.B.1.a-h is available for designation as RCA, then undisturbed, non-vegetated land that meets the minimal size standards for RCA and that is planted to achieve a diversified indigenous plant

The Planning Department and Zoning Compliance Officer shall inspect the site prior to recording of the final subdivision plat.
8.2.3 Maintenance Responsibility and Replacement of Damaged Vegetation
A) Maintenance Responsibility
The owners of the property and their agents, heirs, or assigns shall be responsible for the installation, preservation, and maintenance of all planting and physical features required under this article. Any vegetation that is dead, substandard, unhealthy, of poor structural quality, or missing, shall be removed and replaced in conformance with the standards of this section and to the approved site plan or subdivision plan. In the event that any vegetation or physical element functioning to meet the standards of this section is severely damaged due to an unusual weather occurrence or natural catastrophe, the owner shall have one year or one growing season, whichever is sooner, to replace or replant. All plant materials should be allowed to reach their mature size and maintained at their mature size. Plants shall not be cut or severely pruned so that their natural form is impaired. This section shall not apply when a developer has damaged or destroyed vegetation in the buffer, or caused vegetation to be damaged or destroyed. In this case, revegetation according to subsection (c) is required.
B) Replacement of Disturbed and Damaged Vegetation
The disturbance of any landscaped area or vegetation installed pursuant to this article shall constitute a violation of the site plan or subdivision plan. All disturbed landscaped areas and vegetation shall be replanted so as to meet the standards of this section as well as the approved site plan or subdivision plan.
C) Replacement of Existing, Original Vegetation
Existing trees and vegetation preserved pursuant to this article shall be considered as elements of a development project in the same manner as parking, building materials, and other site details. If such trees or vegetation are damaged during construction or dead within two years of completion of development, they shall be promptly replaced based on the standards of this section, taking into account any unique site conditions and vegetation remaining within the landscaped area. Replacement consists of one or a combination of the following:
1) A base fine of $20.00 per square foot area of disturbed area, not to exceed $40,000 total in accordance with appropriate penalty requirements then in effect.
2) Any tree with a caliper of at least 8 inches that is damaged or removed shall be replaced with one or more trees that have a caliper of at least 2½ inches and a cumulative caliper equal to or greater than the original tree.
3) For all other cases where existing vegetation is damaged or removed, the type and amount of replacement vegetation required shall be that which is necessary to provide the type of landscaped buffer or Resource Conservation Area required. Each category listed below is equal to one unit. One unit represents the replacement for 200 square feet of disturbed area. Fractions of a unit must be rounded to the nearest whole unit. Depending on the type of vegetation disturbed and the type buffer or Resource Conservation Area required, the Planning Department shall

Sec. 8.2 / LANDSCAPING, BUFFERING, AND SCREENING
Sec. 8.2.3 / Maintenance Responsibility and Replacement of Damaged Vegetation
November 19, 2019 Article 8 - Page 22
determine which units must be used. For example, a 9,950 square foot disturbed area is required to have 49.75 units of replacement vegetation, which rounded to the nearest whole unit is 50 units of replacement vegetation. To ensure plant diversity and suitability, the Planning Department may, in consultation with the applicant, determine that twenty-five of category a and twenty-five of category c are required in one instance, while in another instance ten of each category (a, b, c, d, and e) are required. These requirements shall also be used to re-vegetate non-vegetated areas that are being used to meet Resource Conservation Area requirements. The five categories are as follows:
a) One large deciduous tree of at least 2½ inches caliper and 12 feet high.
b) Two small type trees of at least 1½ inches caliper and at least 8 feet high above ground level at the time of installation.
c) One large evergreen tree of at least 2½ inches caliper and at least 8 feet high above ground level at the time of installation.
d) Four evergreen shrubs of at least 2 feet in height and 3-gallon container size at the time of installation.
e) Four deciduous shrubs of at least 2 feet in height and 3-gallon container size at the time of installation.
4) In addition to the above requirements, on existing slopes equal to or greater than a ratio of 2:1, provide 1-gallon groundcover plants spaced approximately 2 feet on center.
5) The specific quantities and sizes of plants listed above may be adjusted by the Planning Department in order to meet the standards for a required buffer type, the replacement or establishment of an approved Resource Conservation Area, and/or to more appropriately match the surrounding existing vegetation, so long as substantially the same performance is achieved. Refer to the Town of Apex Design and Development Manual, Section 2 for more specific information.

a) Type A: Opaque
This buffer functions as an opaque screen from the ground to a height of at least 6 feet. Plantings of deciduous and evergreen trees shall obtain a height at maturity of between 18 and 60 feet and have no unobstructed openings between tree canopies at maturity. Large trees shall be spaced no wider than 15 feet at time of planting. Screening plants for the Type A buffer shall be evergreen and between 5 and 6 feet tall at the time of installation (see Plant Standards Sec. 8.2.2.B). At least 50% of the required trees and 100% of the required shrubs shall be evergreen species. Opaque fencing may be used to meet the opacity requirement provided that it is planned as an integral part of the buffer and is located immediately adjacent to the individual lots. Where a fence is used, shrubs shall be clustered so that there is a minimum of three (3) small evergreen shrubs spaced every 20 feet.
b) Type B: Semi-Opaque
This buffer serves as a semi-opaque screen from the ground to a height of between 3 and 6 feet with openings no greater than 10 feet. Trees shall obtain a height of between 18 and 40 feet at maturity and have no unobstructed openings greater than 20 feet between canopies at maturity. Large trees shall be spaced no wider than 40 feet at time of planting, and small trees shall be spaced no more than 20 feet. At least 75% of the required shrubs must be evergreen species.
c) Type C: Spatial Definition
This buffer is intended to provide a sense of separation between adjoining properties without significantly obstructing the view from one to the other. Generally, it will be less opaque than the Type B buffer, and more oriented towards aesthetic enhancement rather than screening. It shall include a combination of trees and shrubs that provide intermittent visual obstruction from the ground to a height of at least 20 feet. Large trees shall be spaced no wider than 50 feet at time of planting, and small trees shall be spaced no wider than 25 feet. At least 25% of the trees or shrubs must be evergreen species.
d) Type D: Streetfront
This buffer is intended to provide a softening of the view of a particular property from the street, without eliminating views to and from the property. This shall include at least one (1) large type tree for every 1,000 square feet of buffer, or two (2) small trees for every 1,000 square feet of buffer. Large trees may not be spaced more than 30 feet apart, and small trees no more than 15 feet apart. At maturity, these trees shall reach a height of at least 20 feet. A streetfront buffer is required along all private and public streets except thoroughfares and controlled access highways.
e) Type E: Streetscape Buffers Along Thoroughfares
Streetscape buffers are required on all thoroughfares as shown
Article 8 / General Development Standards
Sec. 8.2 / LANDSCAPING, BUFFERING, AND SCREENING
Sec. 8.2.6 / Buffering
November 19, 2019 Article 8 - Page 34
on the adopted thoroughfare map. Streetscape buffers are to remain undisturbed to the maximum extent practicable except where no existing vegetation is present.
All uses that require site plan approval or subdivision plan approval shall preserve, install, and maintain a planted streetscape along each thoroughfare it abuts which protects the existing vegetation and abuts the perimeter of the property. All streetscape plantings, including the installation of all plant materials, shall perform in accordance with specifications of this section.
The width of the streetscape buffer shall be at least 30 feet if it remains undisturbed. If the buffer will require encroachment in order to install anything other than public street improvements, the portion of the buffer that is disturbed must be at least 50 feet wide. The disturbed section shall be replanted and the undisturbed section shall be supplemented to the standards required in Table 1. A buffer with an encroachment due to public street improvements may be reduced per Sec. 8.1.2.C.6 Resource Conservation Area Exchanged for Reduced Width Buffers and Sec. 8.2.6.B.3.b.
If any part of the buffer is disturbed or non-vegetated, the owner shall plant one large tree and two small trees for every 1,000 square feet of disturbed or non-vegetated buffer. Where existing overhead utility lines interfere with part of the buffer, the large tree requirement may be substituted by installing all small trees (4 small trees for every 1,000 square feet).
Trees shall be installed on the thoroughfare side of any berm or screen planting no less than 10 feet from the right-of-way of the thoroughfare. Street trees may be installed in a linear fashion or in clusters or groupings of larger and/or small trees in combination with associated plantings so as to enhance the visual appearance of the streetscape and views from adjacent properties.
Each large canopy tree in the streetscape shall be provided with at least 350 square feet of pervious ground area for root growth. Any planting area bounded by a built-upon area shall be at least 10 feet wide.
Where there is a vehicular use area between the right-of-way of the thoroughfare and a permanent building, the streetscape shall provide a semi-opaque screen or barrier between the right-of- way and the vehicular use area. The screen or barrier may consist of existing vegetation, plants, earthen berms, decorative entry fences (not privacy), walls, or any combination thereof that meets the following requirements:
The screen shall occupy the entire 100 percent length of the vehicular use area except for sidewalks and driveways. All vehicular use areas must be screened from off-site view. Plant material shall be at least 2 feet tall above the ground at the time of installation and must reach a height of 3 feet within 3 years.

November 19, 2019 Article 8 - Page 35
Fences, walls, and berms may be installed in addition to plantings (see Sec. 8.2.7 Fences, Walls, and Berms). Plant materials shall be installed that meet these performance standards. Berms may be installed if there is no existing vegetation. The installation of additional plant materials is required so as to enhance the visual and aesthetical qualities of the streetscape.
f) Buffers Along Fully- and Limited-Controlled Access Highways
All uses that require site plan approval or subdivision plan approval shall install and maintain a vegetated buffer along each controlled access highway as follows:
(i) Residential Uses
A 100-foot Type A buffer is required along all fully- and limited-controlled access highways, measured from ultimate right-of-way. All highway buffers along residential uses shall remain undisturbed to the maximum extent practicable. The Planning Director or designee shall determine at the time of site plan or subdivision plan review what supplementation of plant material must occur to bring the existing natural buffer to a Type A standard. Disturbance within the buffer is only allowed as follows:
(a) Construction of driveways and public streets Construction of driveways and public streets perpendicular to the buffer strip shall be perpendicular to the buffer strip shall be allowed where such construction is necessary allowed where such construction is necessary for safe ingress or egress to the site.

i. No more than 20% of the façades of non-residential buildings facing the highway can use EIFS or other synthetic stucco.
ii. Pedestrian connections in the form of sidewalks and/or multi-use paths shall be made from non-residential buildings to adjacent residential development and properties with future residential land use. The form of the connection shall be determined by the Planning Director or designee.
iii. Furthermore, properties that front a limited-controlled access highway with no other access or road frontage shall be allowed to reduce the opacity of no more than 50% of this buffer to a Type E buffer. The remainder of the buffer shall be planted to a Type A standard.
g) Buffers Along the American Tobacco Trail
For sites that contain and/or are adjacent to the American Tobacco Trail, a buffer of at least 50 feet in width is required. The buffer shall function as visual separation between the public trail and private property; it shall contain native plant material, supplemented where necessary with deciduous and evergreen trees to provide an opaque screen for the benefit of trail users and adjoining property owners. The buffer shall conform to the requirements of a Type A Buffer as described in Sec. 8.2.6.B.5.a.
C) General Buffering Requirements
1) Location of Buffers
a) The buffers required by this Section shall be located along the outer perimeter of the parcel and shall extend to the parcel boundary line or right-of-way line. Buffers shall not include any portion of an existing public or private street, proposed public street, existing or proposed private easement, or right-of-way. The required buffer width does not just determine a simple setback but is to be totally planted to meet the requirements for the applicable buffer type. Therefore, the plants comprising the
Article 8 / General Development Standards
Sec. 8.2 / LANDSCAPING, BUFFERING, AND SCREENING
Sec. 8.2.6 / Buffering
November 19, 2019 Article 8 - Page 37
buffer shall be spread across the entire width of the buffer and not just planted in a row or rows.
b) Buffers for residential subdivisions shall not be located within the individual lots that make up the subdivision, but shall be located in common areas, and shall be owned and maintained by the homeowners association.
2) Existing Vegetation
a) Existing significant vegetation within the required buffer shall be preserved and credited toward standards for the type of buffer required at the time of site plan approval, subdivision, or PD plan approval. In order to determine which existing vegetation shall be preserved, the applicant shall provide a Site and Tree Survey per the requirements of Sec. 8.1.2.B.2.
b) No plantings shall be required when a preserved wetland or required riparian buffer exists within a required buffer.
3) Installation of New Vegetation and Other Features
If existing significant vegetation and other site features do not fully meet the standards for the type of buffer required, then additional vegetation and/or site features (including fences) shall be planted or installed within the required buffer area. All plantings must face toward the public right-of-way.
4) No Development Within the Required Buffer
The required buffer shall not contain any development, built-upon area, or site features that do not function to meet the standards of this Section or that require removal of existing vegetation, except for signs within platted sign easements, utilities within public utility easements, and public art on private property within a platted public art on private property easement (see Secs. 8.1.2.C.8 and 8.2.2.C.2.a). When a public utility easement is located within a Streetfront Buffer or a Thoroughfare Buffer that is 20 feet or greater in width, a minimum 20 foot wide planting area shall be provided as measured from the edge of the easement. For all other required buffers, a minimum 10 foot wide planting area shall be provided as measured from the edge of the easement. The planting area shall be as wide as necessary in order to accommodate all required buffer plantings. Tree species with compact root systems shall be used adjacent to the easement.
5) Critical Root Zone Encroachment
If the critical root zone of any tree encroaches one-third or more onto an adjacent parcel, the developing site must protect the critical root zone to protect the health and vigor of the tree.
6) Ownership of Buffers
a) No required buffer in a residential subdivision shall be wholly owned (in fee simple absolute) by the owner of an individual residential building lot zoned for residential uses. The buffers shall be owned by a property owners association or be owned by a third party or shall be otherwise divided so that the buffer is not removed, modified, or damaged. Any required buffer (including those required as a zoning condition) for a residential

development shall not be credited toward meeting the lot size requirements. The preferred method is that the residential buffer be a separate lot and owned by a separate entity (e.g., property owners association).
b) The buffers required under this Sec. 8.2 may be left under the control of the lot owner provided that: (1) the width of the buffer is doubled; and (2) each lot that contains a buffer must have a deed restriction recorded with a restriction that the buffer is to be left undisturbed. In any case, where control of the buffer is through a property owners association, modifications, removal, or damage to the buffer by an adjacent homeowner shall be prohibited. The property owners association shall be responsible for any violation related to the buffers in accordance with Sec. 8.2.3 Maintenance Responsibility and Replacement of Damaged Vegetation. This Provision applies to residential developments only.
8.2.7 Fences, Walls, and Berms
Fences, walls, and berms are permitted as elements of site design and in some locations, may be used to conceal storage or other unsightly or conflicting land uses. Fences are not allowed around detention and retention basins per Sec. 6.1.12.B.10. All fences, walls, and berms shall meet the following requirements:
A) Materials
1) Fences or walls shall be constructed of wood, stone, brick, decorative concrete block, wrought iron, (or products created to resemble these materials), or a combination of any of these materials. Chain link fencing is allowed provided it meets the standards in Sec. 8.2.7.A.4.
2) All fencing shall be finished on the side facing a public right-of-way or adjacent properties.
3) Materials such as, but not limited to, plywood, particleboard, sheet metal, concrete slabs, concrete barriers shall not be used for fencing or for walls.
4)
a) Chain link fencing used in non-residential zoning districts shall be coated in black, brown or dark green vinyl or equivalent, except that chain link fencing used in industrial zoning districts or for public utility purposes does not require vinyl coating.
b) In residential zoning districts, chain link fencing is only allowed in the side and/or rear yards of individual lots and is not allowed to be used by the developer of a subdivision for buffering and screening. Chain link fencing used for single-family recreational accessory uses as permitted in Sec. 4.5.4 such as but not limited to playgrounds, swimming pools, hot tubs, spas, tennis courts, volleyball courts, and basketball courts, shall be vinyl coated in black, brown or dark green, and must meet the requirements of Sec. 8.2.7.B.1 Fence/Wall Height.
5) Barbed-wire and similar fence materials may only be used in conjunction with a permitted agricultural use or in conjunction with the permitted keeping of horses or livestock. Up to 2 of barbed wire can be erected on top of another fence type for safety purposes for industrial and utility uses.

Sec. 8.2.7 / Fences, Walls, and Berms
November 19, 2019 Article 8 - Page 39
B) Fence/Wall Height
1) No freestanding fence or wall shall exceed seven feet in height including piers, posts, and finials. Non-residential fences or walls may be higher for security and/or screening purposes with approval by the Planning Director, after taking into account topography, unique site conditions, and unique safety, security, and screening requirements of the property owner (see Sec. 8.2.8 Screening). Vinyl coated chain link fencing for single-family recreational accessory uses that typically require taller fencing, such as tennis courts and basketball courts, may be approved up to 10 feet in height by the Planning Director, after taking into account site topography, existing and proposed vegetative screening, setbacks, unique site conditions, and the nature of the single-family recreational accessory use.
2) Fences and walls in front yards shall not exceed 48 inches in height. Piers or posts and finials may extend up to 6 inches higher than the finished fence or wall height.
3) Fences and walls shall be allowed in the controlled and limited access highway buffer, thoroughfare buffer, and streetfront buffer provided that they meet the requirements of Sec. 8.2.7.F Fences in Required Buffers and the height requirements of Sec. 8.2.7.B.1 and 2.
C) Fences/Walls Abutting Public Rights-of-Way
1) Where non-residential fencing or walls will abut a public right-of-way, it shall be set back at least 4 feet from the right-of-way, and a minimum of 3 small evergreen shrubs spaced every 20 feet shall be planted on the side of the fence or wall facing the surrounding rights-of way, walks, parks, trails, or other public use properties. Plantings shall not be planted within the public right-of-way. Fencing or walls must provide visual interest through the use of different materials, decorative posts and finials.
Figure 8.2.7(C): Fences/Walls Abutting Public Rights-of-Way
2) Where a residential fence or wall will abut a major or minor thoroughfare, it must provide visual interest through changes in fence setbacks or materials, or through the use of decorative posts with finials, or through the use of plants spaced every 20 feet on the side of the fence or wall facing the public thoroughfare. Plantings shall not be planted within the public right-of-way.

D) Berms
Berms may be utilized as part of the landscaping and shall be covered with turf grasses or other appropriate groundcovers, shrubs, and trees as required to meet specific landscaping, screening, or buffer requirements as determined by the Planning Department provided that:
1) Berms shall be constructed to blend into the overall landscape and undulate to imitate the surrounding topography.
2) Berms shall be constructed to drain well and be composed of soils suitable to grow and sustain plants with at least the top foot consisting of good quality topsoil.
3) The slope of a berm shall not exceed a three to one (3:1) run to rise ratio.
E) Fences/Walls in Required Buffers
1) Fences/walls shall be permitted in buffers only where they are planned as an integral part of the buffer. Fences/walls are not allowed in Riparian Buffers per Sec. 6.1.11, except for fences/walls installed by the Town for utility protection. Where there is existing vegetation, the installation of the fence/wall must be done in such a manner as to protect significant vegetation, such as, but not limited to, being hand built and winding around trees. It is not the intent of this section to allow the piecemeal installation of fences/walls in buffers or the installation of private fences/walls that result in completely enclosing sections of buffer inside of a fence/wall or fences/walls.
2) Fences shall supplement and not replace the existing and/or required plantings. Fences shall be set back from the edge of the buffer so that the buffer plantings are located on both sides of the fence, with a minimum of four feet from public rights-of-way. Fences shall be of uniform design throughout the buffer. The property owners association or other entity controlling the buffer shall maintain fences. Privately owned and/or installed fences are not permitted in the buffers except where designed and approved as part of the overall buffer.

F) Maintenance
The owner of the property (or other party responsible for maintenance as depicted on the approved site plan) on which the fence, wall or berm is located is required to maintain the fence or wall in a safe and attractive condition. This shall mean the following:
1) No fence or wall shall have more that 20% of its surface area with disfigured, cracked, ripped or peeling paint or other material;
2) A fence or wall shall not stand with bent or broken supports, including loose or missing appendages;
3) Fences and walls shall be plumb (vertical) to the ground; and
4) Replacement of non-conforming fences, walls and berms shall comply with all the requirements of this section.
8.2.8 Screening
A) Integrate with Overall Design
Loading docks, trash containers, outdoor storage, mechanical and HVAC equipment, and similar facilities on the roof, on the ground, or on buildings shall be incorporated into the overall design theme of the building and the landscape so that the architectural design is continuous and uninterrupted by ladders, towers, fences, and equipment, and no attention is attracted to such facilities by use of screening materials that are different from or inferior to the principal materials of the building and landscape. These areas shall be located and screened so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these facilities are fully contained and out of view from adjacent properties and public streets. See also Sec. 4.1.2 Outside Storage, Display, and Sales/Rentals.
B) Screening Methods
Screening shall be accomplished by the following methods:
1) Dumpsters.
a) Dumpsters shall be screened with an opaque enclosure, fence or wall that reaches eight (8) feet in height or the height of the dumpster, whichever is higher. The design and materials of the enclosure, fence or wall must be presented as part of the Exempt Site Plan, Site Plan, or Master Subdivision Plan approval process. The screening structures must be constructed of masonry materials. The screening structures shall be architecturally compatible with the principal building(s) on site. The operational parts of the enclosure such as the gate frame and hinge assemblies must be built of heavy-duty material such as steel and engineered to hold up to daily use and abuse; wood is not allowed;
b) Gates or doors on dumpster enclosures shall be constructed of opaque metal, wood composite, or PVC composite. When composite products are used, they shall be placed close enough together to create an opaque gate. Any composite product used shall be lightweight. No wooden gates are permitted;
c) Where practical, shrubs or other plants must be planted outside the enclosure to visually soften the appearance;
Article 8 / General Development Standards

Sec. 8.3.1 / Applicability
November 19, 2019 Article 8 - Page 42
d) The overall enclosure design must comply with the standards found in the Towns Design and Development Manual.
2) Ground-located HVAC or other mechanical or utility equipment, including satellite dishes and roll-out carts.
HVAC or other mechanical or utility equipment and roll-out carts located on the ground shall be screened with an opaque fence and vegetation or with an opaque screen of evergreen shrubs. Fences or shrubs shall be a minimum height of the proposed structure to be screened at installation. If ground located HVAC or other mechanical or utility equipment (including satellite dishes) are six (6) feet in height or taller, then fencing or other enclosure is required with vegetation planted outside the enclosure.
3) Rooftop HVAC or other mechanical equipment, including satellite dishes.
HVAC or other mechanical equipment located on the roof of buildings and not adequately screened by parapet walls shall be screened with an opaque screen similar in materials and color to the building materials.
4) Other.
Smaller devices such as but not limited to electrical boxes, vents, and externally mounted piping and conduit must also blend with and be incorporated into the overall architecture of the building. Where it is impractical to physically screen these smaller devices they may be painted to match the primary building color or the color of the portion of the building where they are mounted or affixed.
8.3 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
8.3.1 Applicability
A) New Development
The off-street parking and loading standards of this section shall apply to the erection of any building, and to any new use established.
B) Downtown Exempted
However, within the central business district, there shall be no minimum motor vehicle or bicycle parking requirements in existing platted areas that are, or previously have been, in commercial use.
C) Expansions and Alterations
The off-street parking and loading standards of this section shall apply when an existing structure or use is expanded or enlarged. Additional off-street parking and loading spaces shall be required to serve only the enlarged or expanded area, provided that in all cases the number of off-street parking and loading spaces provided for the entire use (pre-existing plus expansion) must equal at least 75 percent of the minimum ratio established in the Off-Street Parking Schedules of this section.
D) Change of Use
Off-street parking and loading must be provided for any change of use or manner of operation that would, based on the Off-Street Parking Schedules of this section, result in a requirement for more parking or loading spaces than the existing use.

C) Off-Street Parking Schedule C
Uses that reference Schedule C have widely varying parking and loading demand characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single off-street parking or loading standard. Upon receiving a development application for a use subject to Schedule C standards, the Planning Director shall apply the off-street parking and loading standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use, or shall establish minimum off-street parking requirements on the basis of a parking and loading study prepared by the applicant. Such a study must include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by the Planning Director, and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as, or comparable with, the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study must document the source of data used to develop the recommendations.
D) Standards for Off-Street Compact Spaces
Up to 20% of off-street parking spaces may be designed for compact cars subject to the following conditions:
1) Compact spaces shall only be permitted when there are extra parking spaces beyond the required parking in 8.3.2 Off-Street Parking Requirement;
2) Parking spaces should be grouped or placed in clusters rather than being scattered simply to solve parking layout difficulties; and
3) Each parking space shall be clearly marked with the words "Compact Only" and such parking spaces shall comply with the dimensional standards in Table 8.3-4.
E) Maximum Number of Spaces Allowed
The minimum parking requirements shall not be exceeded by more than 25% for uses that require up to 100 spaces or 15% for uses that require more than 100 spaces. The level(s) of structured parking above the ground level and parking
Article 8 / General Development Standards
Sec. 8.3 / OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
Sec. 8.3.3 / Rules for Computing Requirements
November 19, 2019 Article 8 - Page 47
located under a building shall not count toward the maximum number of spaces allowed. The maximum number of spaces shall only be exceeded according to the standards below.
1) Parking Analysis Requirements
A parking analysis shall be submitted for review and approval by the Planning Director. Such analysis shall include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by the Planning Director, and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. Any additional parking that is proposed to be redeveloped in the future with a use other than parking shall be labeled in the parking analysis. The study shall document the source of data used to develop the recommendations.
2) Tree Planting
If approval is granted by the Planning Director to exceed the maximum parking requirement, then at least one (1) large tree type shall be planted for every 10 parking spaces above the maximum requirement. These trees shall be located completely within tree islands. See Design and Development Manual for information on large type trees. See Sec. 8.2.6.D.1 Landscape Islands.
8.3.3 Rules for Computing Requirements
A) Multiple Uses
Unless otherwise approved, lots containing more than one use must provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses.
B) Fractions
When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any fraction of one-half or less shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number and any fraction of more than one-half shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number.
C) Area Measurements
Unless otherwise specifically noted, all square footage-based parking and loading standards must be computed on the basis of gross floor area excluding any indoor storage/warehousing space that is accessory to the primary use. Square footage of accessory indoor storage/warehousing space shall be labeled separately on the site plan. Parking requirements for all indoor storage/warehousing space shall meet the requirements in Table 8.3-2.
D) Occupancy- or Capacity-Based Standards
For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on employees, students, residents or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift, the maximum enrollment, or the maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever is applicable and whichever results in the greater number of spaces.
E) Unlisted Uses
Upon receiving a development application for a use not specifically listed in an off-street parking schedule, the Planning Director shall apply the off-street parking standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use.
Article 8 / General Development Standards
Sec. 8.3 / OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
Sec. 8.3.4 / Location
November 19, 2019 Article 8 - Page 48
8.3.4 Location
A) General
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, required off-street parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the principal use. For multi-family or apartment uses where there is more than one building on the site, parking must be distributed to serve all buildings.
B) On-Street Parking
Striped, on-street parking located along a propertys street frontage may be utilized to meet all or a portion of the parking requirements for that property. The location of on-street parking spaces must comply with the Town of Apex Code of Ordinances - Sec 20. - Article VIII. - Parking. This requirement to stripe such spaces is not applicable within the MORR district.

Article 8 / General Development Standards
Sec. 8.3 / OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
Sec. 8.3.6 / Parking Lot Design Standards
November 19, 2019 Article 8 - Page 50
8.3.6 Parking Lot Design Standards
A) Purpose
Because parking areas frequently predominate the visual impact of a development, this section is intended to beautify and enhance these spaces without compromising vehicular and pedestrian safety. The Town does not desire parking areas which dominate a site and advocates de-emphasized parking in favor of architectural design, landscape buffers, and pedestrian amenities. Site development shall also address the safety and comfort of the pedestrian in walking within and between areas of automobile movement.
Figure 8.3.6.A: Illustration of Landscaped Parking Area
B) Site Layout
1) In order to develop a more pedestrian-oriented streetfront and to maximize the exposure of the primary structure to the primary street, no more than 50% of off-street parking spaces shall be positioned between the building and the primary street. If more than one street or internal drive abuts the property, the designation of the primary street shall be based on the functional class as determined by the Planning Director. See subsection 2 below for location requirements within the Small Town Character District. The following shall be exempt from this requirement:
a) Off-street parking lots with a total of 35 parking spaces or less; and
b) Off-street parking lots for properties zoned Light Industrial or Tech/Flex provided they are not located on a limited- or controlled-access highway, thoroughfare, major collector, or minor collector street.
2) No more than one double-loaded bay of parking shall be positioned between the building and the primary street for all developments within the Small Town Character District, excluding developments within the Central Business District. If more than one street abuts the property, the designation of the primary street shall be based on the functional class as determined by the Planning Director. When parking is provided behind the building, there shall be a public building entrance on the rear of the building.
Article 8 / General Development Standards
Sec. 8.3 / OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
Sec. 8.3.6 / Parking Lot Design Standards
November 19, 2019 Article 8 - Page 51
3) Any parking areas containing more than 50 spaces shall be visually subdivided through the use of buildings, planting areas, plazas, courtyards, or landscaped islands.
4) Parking lots shall be designed to allow pedestrians to safely move from their vehicles to the building. On smaller lots, this shall be achieved by providing a sidewalk at the perimeter of the lot. On larger parking lots, corridors within the parking area should channel pedestrians from the car to all customer entrances. These corridors should be delineated by a paving material that is different from that of vehicular areas and by small posts or bollards, which may incorporate lighting.
5) Driveways to parking areas shall be no wider than current Town specifications.
6) All nonresidential development and all residential development in the PUD-CZ, SD-CZ, TND-CZ, and MORR districts shall comply with the Pedestrian Flow design standards located in Sec. 8.4.4.
C) Markings
1) Each required off-street parking space and off-street parking facility shall be identified by surface markings and shall be maintained in a manner so as to be readily visible and accessible at all times, except during periods of snow. Such markings shall be arranged to provide for orderly and safe loading, unloading, parking, and storage of vehicles. Markings required to be maintained in a highly visible condition include striping, directional arrows, lettering on signs, and handicapped-area designations. All paved parking spaces shall be striped white. Such striping shall be a minimum of four (4) inches wide.
2) One-way and two-way accesses into required parking facilities shall be identified by directional arrows. Any two-way access located at any angle other than 90 degrees to a street shall be marked with a traffic separation stripe the length of the access. This requirement does not apply to aisles.
D) Surfacing and Maintenance
All off-street parking areas shall be paved and kept in a dust-free condition at all times. Permeable pavement, if used, shall comply with the North Carolina Department of Environmental Qualitys Minimum Design Criteria in the NCDEQ Stormwater Design Manual.
1) Exceptions
Parking for the following shall be gravel or paved and kept in a dust-free condition at all times:
a) All uses in the CB Conservation Buffer zoning district;
b) Athletic Fields only under the category of Entertainment, Outdoor where allowed; and
c) Uses associated with Landmark and other historic structures. Exposed aggregate concrete, or similar, may be used for paving.
2) Gravel parking shall at a minimum meet the following specifications:
a) Compacted Subgrade;

8.3.9 Off-Street Parking Alternatives
The Planning Director shall be authorized to approve alternatives to providing the number of off-street parking spaces required by the Off-Street Parking Schedules in accordance with this subsection.
A) General
1) Procedure
Alternative parking plans shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Director prior to site plan approval.
Article 8 / General Development Standards
Sec. 8.3 / OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
Sec. 8.3.9 / Off-Street Parking Alternatives
November 19, 2019 Article 8 - Page 55
2) Violations
Violations of approved alternative parking plans constitute a violation of this Code and will be subject to the enforcement and penalty provisions of Article 11: Enforcement.
B) Off-Site Parking
The Planning Director may approve the location of required off-street parking spaces on a separate lot from the lot on which the principal use is located if the off-site parking complies with the all of following standards.
1) Ineligible Activities
Off-site parking may not be used to satisfy the off-street parking standards for residential uses (except for guest parking), convenience stores, or other convenience-oriented uses. Required parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities may not be located off-site.
2) Location
No off-site parking space may be located more than 600 feet from the primary entrance of the use served (measured along the shortest legal pedestrian route) unless remote parking shuttle bus service is provided. Off-site parking spaces may not be separated from the use served by a street right-of-way with a width of more than 80 feet, unless a grade-sep-arated pedestrian walkway is provided, or other traffic control or remote parking shuttle bus service is provided.
3) Zoning Classification
Off-site parking areas require the same or a more intensive zoning classification than required for the use served.
4) Agreement for Off-Site Parking
In the event that an off-site parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a written agreement between the record owners will be required. The agreement must guarantee the use of the off-site parking area for at least 10 years. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to the Planning Director for recordation in form established by the Town Attorney. Recordation of the agreement must take place before issuance of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. An off-site parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided, in accordance with the Off-Street Parking Schedules (Section 8.3.2). No use shall be continued if the parking is removed unless substitute parking facilities are provided, and the Planning Director shall be notified at least 60 days prior to the termination of a lease for off-site parking.

8.6 EXTERIOR LIGHTING
8.6.1 Purpose and Intent
The provision of outdoor lighting heightens nighttime safety and visibility, and is used to enhance the security of property and people. Lighting should be provided in areas of heavy vehicle and pedestrian use, and areas that are dangerous if unlit such as stairs, intersections, or changes in grade. It is important to set clear guidelines so that lighting adequately serves the site while minimizing negative impacts on surrounding properties.
8.6.2 Lighting Plan
Any development that proposes exterior lighting shall include a detailed exterior lighting plan as part of the plan submission. This plan shall include:
A) Specifications for the lighting fixtures such as: type of unit (cutoff, non-cutoff, glare shields, etc.), lamps (wattage, etc.), electrical load requirements, utility company involved, method of wiring, routing/location of lines, location of lights, and mounting heights.
B) An isofootcandle plan that shows typical foot-candle contours or a point photometric grid that indicates foot-candle levels measured at grade across the site. A point photometric plan is required for major site plans. Other information such as: maximum, average, and minimum site foot-candles and uniformity ratio (average/minimum) should also be included. Foot-candle levels shall be shown at initial levels.
C) Cross-sections of all lighted perimeter areas immediately adjacent to existing residential properties indicating how all exterior lighting (site and building mounted lighting) will be designed to limit spillover light and control off-site glare (see Sec. 8.6.4.D.4). A cross-section must be provided for each adjoining single-family residential property. Where the developing site adjoins multi-family residential property, a typical cross-section must be provided at 100 foot intervals along the common property line.

November 19, 2019 Article 9 - Page 1
ARTICLE 9 DESIGN STANDARDS
9.1 GENERAL
9.1.1 Purpose and Intent
The purpose of this article is to ensure that the physical characteristics of proposed development are compatible when considered within the context of the surrounding area. They should be read in conjunction with the general development regulations of Article 8 and the zoning district-specific standards contained in Article 4.
9.1.2 Applicability
A) These design standards shall be applicable to all nonresidential development under this UDO.
B) These design standards shall also be applicable to residential development, with the exception of one- and two-family dwellings, in the PUD-CZ, SD-CZ, and TND-CZ planned development districts and the MORR district.
9.1.3 General Compatibility Requirement
All development subject to this article shall be compatible with the established architectural character of the Town by using a design that is complementary to existing Town architectural styles, designs, and forms. Compatibility shall be achieved through techniques such as the repetition of roof lines, the use of similar proportions in building mass and outdoor spaces, similar relationships to the street, similar window and door patterns, and the use of building materials that have color, shades, and textures similar to those existing in the immediate area of the proposed development.
9.2 BUILDING AESTHETICS
9.2.1 Purpose
Building aesthetics establish a base criteria related to the appearance of specific structures. These regulations strike a balance between creativity and innovation on one hand, while avoiding obtrusive, incongruous structures on the other. The Town strongly discourages architectural styles that do not build upon and promote the existing character of the Town. The Town supports the view that inspiring, well-maintained, and harmonious development is in the best economic development interests of all residents and businesses.
9.2.2 Building Design
A) Emphasize Human Scale
Building design shall emphasize a human scale at ground level, at entryways, and along street frontages through the creative use of windows, doors, columns, canopies, and awnings.
Article 9 / Design Standards
Sec. 9.2 / BUILDING AESTHETICS
Sec. 9.2.2 / Building Design
November 19, 2019 Article 9 - Page 2
Figure 9.2.2(A): Emphasize Human Scale
B) Major Building Design Features
Major building design features, such as but not limited to windows, shutters,
vents, doors, entrances, awnings, canopies, roof pitch/design, eaves, and
parapets, shall meet the following criteria:
1) Be designed to be in proportion to one another.
2) Be designed so that elements from different styles of architecture or
different time periods are not incongruously utilized on a single building
or within a single development.
C) Structural Lines Retained at Storefront Level
The structural lines of a building and its materials shall be retained at the
storefront level. For instance, brick piers and columns shall be carried down to
street level.
D) Awnings and Canopies
Awnings and canopies shall complement the color and material of the building to
which they are affixed.
E) Massing
A single, large, dominant building mass shall be avoided. Where large structures
are required, mass should be broken up through the use of setbacks, projecting
and recessed elements, and similar design techniques. Changes in mass shall
be related to entrances, the integral structure, and/or the organization of interior
spaces and activities and not merely for cosmetic effect.
F) Avoiding Garage Dominance
Where garages are located in front of, even with, or to the side of a principal
dwelling, the width of garage doors on the house elevation facing the street shall
not exceed 40 percent of the total width of the house and garage together.
G) Accessory Facilities
Uses and devices that are ancillary to the primary building such as loading, trash
containment, maintenance, storage, and mechanical/electrical areas and the
devices and equipment associated with these areas shall be incorporated into
the overall design, architecture, and landscape so that the visual and acoustic
impacts of these functions and devices are fully contained and out of view from
Article 9 / Design Standards
Sec. 9.2 / BUILDING AESTHETICS
Sec. 9.2.3 / Avoiding Monotony of Design
November 19, 2019 Article 9 - Page 3
adjacent properties and public areas.
9.2.3 Avoiding Monotony of Design
Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided by varying detail, form, and siting to the maximum extent practicable, within the standards set forth in this article, to provide visual interest.
9.2.4 Harmony of Design
A) Purpose
The purpose of this section is to preserve the design character of existing development, to protect the visual pattern of the community, and to promote harmony in the visual relationships and transitions between new and older buildings. New buildings should respect the scale, form, and proportion of existing development. This can be done by repeating building lines and surface treatments and by requiring some uniformity of detail, scale, proportion, texture, materials, color, and building form.
Figure 9.2.4(A): Maintain Scale and Design Character of Local Architecture
B) Building Color Shades
Building color shades shall be used to facilitate blending into the neighborhood and unify the development. The color shades of building materials shall draw from the range of color shades that already exist on the block or in the adjacent neighborhood.
C) Building Materials
Building materials shall either be similar to the materials already being used in the neighborhood or, if dissimilar materials are being proposed, other characteristics such as scale and proportions, form, architectural detailing, color, and texture, shall be utilized to ensure that enough similarity exists for the building to be compatible, despite the differences in materials.
D) Similar Size and Height for Infill Development
New infill development shall either be similar in size and height or, if larger, be articulated and subdivided into massing that is proportional to the mass and scale of other structures on the same block, or if no buildings exist thereon, then on adjoining blocks.

E) Unify Individual Storefronts
Figure 9.2.4(E): Unify Individual Storefronts (like the illustration on the left, not like the illustration on the right)
If several storefronts are located in one building, the individual storefronts shall be unified in all exterior design elements, such as mass, window and door placement, color, materials, and signage.
F) Additions and Renovations
Building additions and façade renovations should be designed to reflect existing buildings in scale, materials, window treatment, and color. A change in scale may require a transitional design element between the new development and existing buildings.
G) Varying Architectural Styles
In developments with multiple structures of varying architectural styles, buildings shall be compatible by such means as a pattern of architectural features, similar scale and proportions, and consistent location of signage.
9.3 ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTER
9.3.1 Purpose
Architectural character focuses on the micro-level details that greatly affect the overall appearance of a particular development. These architectural character regulations provide direction in aspects of color, facade materials, rooflines, and the enhancement of entryways. The primary goal is to define the finishing touches that provide the development with a sense of permanence, style, and compatibility. The Town actively discourages proposals that have not taken these matters into account. The Town desires that all development be treated as a lasting contributor to the community and as a good neighbor to its surroundings.
9.3.2 Roofs
A) Roof lines shall be varied to reduce the scale of structures and add visual interest.
B) Roof shape (for example: flat, hip, mansard, or gable) and material shall be architecturally compatible with façade elements and the rest of the building.

Sec. 9.3 / ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTER
Sec. 9.3.3 / Facades
November 19, 2019 Article 9 - Page 5
9.3.3 Facades
A) Recesses and Projections
Facades greater than 100 feet in length, measured horizontally, must incorporate recesses and projections along at least 20 percent of the length of the façade. Windows, awnings, and arcades should total at least 60 percent of the façade length abutting a public street.
B) Repeating Design Patterns
Facades greater than 100 feet in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate a repeating pattern of change in color, texture, and material modules. All elements should repeat at intervals of no more than 30 feet, either horizontally or vertically.
C) Renovations
Façade renovations shall incorporate original building details to the maximum extent practicable.
D) Materials
Brick, stone, or wood facades shall not be covered or replaced with artificial siding or panels.
E) Roof Cornices
If roof cornices have been removed or damaged on an existing building, renovations of that building must include retaining, repairing, and replacing the roof cornices if previously removed.
F) Replacement of Windows
Replacement of windows on the façade of an existing building shall be accomplished by using windows of the same trim size and character as the original.
G) Exterior Wall Cladding
All exterior walls visible from a parking lot or public right-of-way in any zoning district except Light Industrial (LI) shall be clad with the same material required for the front of the building. Buildings in the LI district are required to provide the same material as the front of the building for at least 25% of the area of the side façades and 100% of the area of side façades directly facing a public right-of-way. All walls not visible from a parking lot or public right-of-way, or the remaining 75% of the side façades in the LI district, may be constructed of alternate material(s), but shall be of a color that is complimentary to the primary material, is incorporated into the overall color scheme of the building, and is approved by the Planning Director. See also Sec. 9.3.5(A) Predominant Exterior Building Materials.
H) Building Orientation
To the maximum extent feasible, new buildings shall be oriented or designed to minimize shadows falling on public or semi-public spaces.
9.3.4 Entryways
A) Required Entryway Features
Each principal building on a site should have a clearly defined, highly visible customer entrance featuring no less than two of the following: canopies or
Article 9 / Design Standards

Sec. 9.3.5 / Color and Materials
November 19, 2019 Article 9 - Page 6
porticos, arcades, arches, wing walls, and/or planters.
9.3.5 Color and Materials
A) Predominant Exterior Building Materials
Predominant exterior building materials shall be high quality materials, including brick, wood, stacked stone, other native stone, and tinted/textured concrete masonry units. In the LI zoning district, concrete masonry units shall be tinted/textured or painted.
B) Colors
1) Façade colors shall be of low reflectance and/or subtle colors. Building trim may feature brighter colors, but neon tubing is not allowed as an accent material. The use of high intensity colors or fluorescent colors shall be prohibited.
2) Variations in color schemes are encouraged in order to articulate entryways and public amenities so as to give greater recognition to these features.

ARTICLE 10 NONCONFORMITIES
10.1 PURPOSE AND INTENT
Within the provisions established by this Ordinance, there exist uses of land, structures, lots and signs that were lawfully established before this Ordinance was adopted or amended, that now do not conform to the terms and requirements of this Ordinance. The purpose and intent of this article is to regulate and limit the continued existence of those uses, structures, lots and signs that do not conform to the provisions of this Ordinance or any amendments thereto.
It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue, until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival except under the limited circumstances established in this article. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that changes in nonconformities shall not be permitted. The provisions of this article are designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconformities to preserve the integrity of this Ordinance.
10.2 NONCONFORMING USES
Nonconforming uses of land are declared generally incompatible with this Ordinance. Nonconforming uses of land may continue in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
10.2.1 Normal Maintenance or Repair
Normal maintenance or repair of structures where nonconforming uses are located may be performed in any period of 12 consecutive months, to an extent not exceeding 15 percent of the current assessed value of the structure, provided that the cubic content of the structure existing after the date it became nonconforming shall not be increased, except pursuant to the standards of this Section.
10.2.2 Enlargement or Expansion
A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or expanded in area occupied, except a nonconforming use may be enlarged in any area of the same structure in which is manifestly designed for such use prior to the date the use became a nonconformity.
10.2.3 Relocation
A structure housing a nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole, or in part, to another location on or off the parcel of land on which it is located, unless the relocation of the nonconforming use decreases the nonconformity.
10.2.4 Damage and Restoration of Structure Housing Nonconforming Use
Any conforming structure housing a nonconforming use that is damaged by any means to an extent exceeding a percentage of its then reproducible value equal to 100 percent minus two percent per year of age of the structure, or 60 percent, whichever is greater, shall comply with the use standards of this Ordinance when it is re-constructed. Any conforming structure housing a nonconforming use that is damaged by any means to a lesser extent may continue the nonconforming use if it is reconstructed and used as before within two years of the damage.
10.2.5 Change in Use
A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other use, unless any new or additional use conforms to the provisions in this Ordinance for the zoning district in which the use is located.
10.2.6 Discontinuance or Abandonment
If a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for a period of more than six consecutive months, whether or not the equipment or furniture are removed, then such use may not be re-established or resumed, and any subsequent use shall conform to the

13.19 Traffic Impact Analysis Required
A Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) shall be prepared by a qualified professional engineer registered to practice in North Carolina and submitted with the initial application for any development that would generate 1,000 or more vehicular trips per day or 100 a.m. or p.m. peak hour trips, whichever is greater. A TIA is also required for a subdivision that individually or collectively (with the subdivision(s) it has its only access to a thoroughfare through whether that access is at one or more points) generates 1,000 or more vehicular trips per day or 100 a.m. or p.m. peak hour trips, whichever is greater. For sites designated as a North Carolina Certified Site by the North Carolina Department of Commerce, the TIA may be submitted at the time of Minor Site Plan submittal instead of Master Subdivision Plan submittal. The calculation of vehicular trips per day as used in this section shall be determined according to the current Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual. If an applicable ITE land use is not available or contains limited data, an alternate trip generation rate may be approved by the Town. The TIA shall indicate the average daily and peak hour vehicular trips generated by the proposed development and shall indicate the trip distribution allocation on all roads and intersections within a study area approved by the Town. The recommendations provided in the TIA shall at a minimum be based on the following:
13.19.1 The TIA shall propose geometric and/or traffic control improvements which will be required to prevent the traffic generated by the proposed development from causing any intersection or roadway approach within the study area to fall below an overall Level of Service (LOS) D, as defined by the latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM).
13.19.2 For intersections projected to operate worse than LOS D for background (future without proposed development) conditions, the TIA shall propose geometric and/or traffic control improvements which will be required to minimize the increase in average overall intersection delay when traffic generated by the proposed development is at least 10% of the projected total a.m. or p.m. peak hour traffic at the intersection.
13.19.3 Stop-controlled minor street approaches to intersections may exceed LOS D provided the addition of development traffic at the intersection is not anticipated to warrant a traffic signal upon build-out and the resulting congestion does not block traffic movements at adjacent intersections.
13.19.4 At existing or proposed stop-controlled intersections, guidelines provided by the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) shall be used in the evaluation of the need for and length of exclusive right and/or left turn lanes to support development traffic.
13.19.5 For any and all turning movements in the study area where the development is anticipated to add at least 10% to the existing a.m. or p.m. peak hour traffic volume, and the existing storage available within the turn bay(s) is shown to be exceeded by existing or projected traffic, the TIA shall propose improvements which may be required to mitigate the impact of development traffic.
The Town Council reserves the right to challenge the assumptions, methodology or conclusions of the study.
