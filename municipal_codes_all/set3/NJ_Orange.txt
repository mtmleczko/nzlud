obtain the approval of the Police Director], which [approval] shall
be granted [if in the opinion of the] Police Director, such
employment would not be inconsistent with the efficient
functioning and good reputation of the Police Department, and
§ 26-6 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 26-6.1
1:208
would not unreasonably endanger or threaten the safety of the
officer or officers who are to perform the work. (Codified as
adopted, Ord. No. 40-2015.)
* Bracketed material = strike through.
(3) All off-duty assignments shall be within the township unless specific
written approval is given by the Police Director.
B. Escrow accounts.
(1) Any person or entity requesting the services of an off-duty law
enforcement officer of the City of Orange Township shall first
complete an application for services and specify dates, time and the
number of hours of employment. If the number of hours is not
known, then an estimate of the number of hours shall be required.
All hours shall be approved in writing by the Police Director. The
person or entity shall establish an escrow account with the City of
Orange Township's Chief Financial Officer by depositing funds
sufficient to cover the rates of compensation and administrative
fees based upon the number of hours of service. If the hours are
estimated, the escrow shall include a payment for an additional
eight (8) hours over the estimate. All overages will be returned to
the person or entity requesting law enforcement services within
sixty (60) days after law enforcement services have been
terminated.
(2) Prior to posting any request for services of off-duty law
enforcement officers, the Police Director or his designee, shall
verify that the balance in the escrow account of the person or entity
requesting services is sufficient to cover the compensation and fees
for the number of hours specified in the application. The Police
Director shall not post a request for services from any person or
entity unless all fees and compensation as described herein have
been deposited with the Township Chief Financial Officer. No
officer shall provide any such services for more hours than are
specified in the request for services unless a new or amended
request for services is submitted accompanied by the appropriate
escrow payment.
(3) In the event the funds in such an escrow account should become
depleted, services of off-duty law enforcement officers shall cease
and requests for further services shall not be performed or posted
until additional funds have been deposited in the escrow account as
described herein. The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) shall not issue
payments to law enforcement officers if funds have not been
deposited and available in the escrow account. No payments will be
issued until deposits are made.
(4) The person or entity requesting such services shall be responsible
for ensuring that sufficient funds remain in the escrow account in
order to avoid any interruption of services.
§ 26-6.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 26-6.1
1:209
(5) All payments for special duty assignments shall be made through a
special police fund established by the Chief Financial Officer of the
municipality from which payment shall be made to the individual
police officers performing such service. All payments from the trust
fund shall be made to the police officers subject to required
deductions and an administrative fee to be retained by the
municipality. All funds in excess of the amount due the City of
Orange Township will be returned to the depositor within thirty
(30) days of written request to refund same. Any dispute between
the contractor and the police officer on assignment as to services
rendered or compensation due shall be determined by the Police
Director. His decision shall be final and binding.
C. Requests for services. All requests to the township for the services of
off-duty law enforcement officers in the City of Orange Township Police
Department shall be forwarded to the Police Director for posting at
least ten (10) days before such services are required. The Police
Director may, but is not required to, waive the ten (10) day notice. Any
law enforcement officer, when so employed by the City of Orange
Township shall be treated as an employee of the City of Orange
Township provided, however, that wages earned for outside
employment shall not be applied toward the pension benefits of law
enforcement officers, so employed, nor shall hours worked for outside
employment be considered in any way compensable as overtime.
D. Rates of compensation; administrative fee; payment for services.

enforcement officers shall be established by ordinance adopted
from time to time by the governing body. The current rate of

A. Emergency inspections.
(1) Emergency inspections may be authorized without warrant if the
Director has reason to believe that a condition exists which poses
an immediate threat to life, health or safety. Such procedure shall
only take place where the time taken to apply for and secure the

penalties hereunder.
B. Search warrants.
(1) The Director may, upon affidavit, apply to the Judge of the
Municipal Court of the city for a search warrant setting forth
factually the actual conditions and circumstances that provide a
reasonable basis for believing that a nuisance or violation of this
chapter may exist on the premises, including one (1) or more of the
following:
(a) That the premises require inspection according to the cycle
established by the city for periodic inspections of premises of
the type involved.

odors) of the premises and its public areas has resulted in the
belief that violations of this chapter exist.
(c) Circumstances such as age and design of fuel-burning
equipment or system, type of incinerator, particular use of the
premises or other factors which render systematic inspections
of such buildings necessary in the interest of public health and
safety.
(2) If the Judge of the Municipal Court of the city is satisfied as to the
matter set forth in the affidavit, he shall authorize the issuance of a
search warrant permitting access to and inspection of that part of
the premises on which the nuisance or violation may exist.
C. All buildings and premises subject to this chapter are subject to
inspection from time to time by the Director of Air Pollution Control or
his duly authorized representatives. All rooms and areas in the building
shall be available and accessible for such inspection, which shall be
made during usual business hours if the premises are used for
nonresidential purposes, provided that inspections may be made at
other times if:
(1) The premises are not available during the foregoing hours for
inspection;
(2) There is reason to believe that violations are occurring on the
premises which can only be apprehended and proved by inspection
during other than the prescribed hours; or
(3) There is reason to believe a violation exists of a character which is
an immediate threat to health or safety requiring inspection and
abatement without delay.
A. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall, upon
conviction thereof, be subject to a fine not exceeding five hundred
dollars ($500.) or imprisonment for a period not exceeding ninety (90)

a separate and distinct violation independent of any other section or
subsection or any order issued pursuant to this chapter. Each day's
failure to comply with any such section or subsection shall constitute a
separate violation.
A. In order to provide ways and means of disposing of leaves only in the
fall and ways and means of disposing of garden rakings, grass and
hedge trimmings and small branches in the spring, the City Council

rehabilitated during the unoccupied period,
(2) Construction has been initiated on the property in the past, but not
for the six (6) month period,
(3) The property has been in tax arrearage for at least one (1)
installment period, or
(4) The property has been determined to be a nuisance by the public

the rehabilitation and reuse of the property and by posting a bond equal
to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the amount determined

section, the municipality shall be deemed to have an ownership interest
in the property for the purpose of filing plans with public agencies and
any state program of grants or loans. Where the municipality borrows
funds for the express purpose of rehabilitating the property, the court
may authorize the municipality to grant a lien or security interest with
priority over all other liens or mortgages other than municipal liens.
H. With the granting of possession by the Court to a municipality of a
property determined to be abandoned, the owner shall continue to be

property to cover any costs of the municipality incurred prior to the
granting by the Court of an order of possession which may include costs
incurred to stabilize or secure the property.

respect to those properties eligible for tax sale under R.S. 54:5-19

Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Objectives
§ 95-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1, et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and Council of the City of Orange
Township, New Jersey does ordain as follows.
§ 95-2. Findings of fact.
§ 95-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
A. The flood hazard areas of the City of Orange Township are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. To protect human life and health;
B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
§ 95-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 95-3
1:491
§ 95-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and,
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

Jersey, as provided in N.J.S.A. 40-55.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Adjustment,
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(10) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if

§ 95-15.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 95-15.1
1:501
§ 95-15.2. Conditions for variances.
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this chapter.
F. The City Engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Insurance Administration upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
(1)—(11) in Section 95-15.1D have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as
a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
C. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and,
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public as identified in Section 95-15.1D, or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
F. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.

for the premises for failure to correct the violations as aforesaid; provided,
however, that if the owner or operator requests a hearing, no such
suspension shall be effective until after a hearing and determination
pursuant to § 156-49, which determination shall state reasonable terms and
conditions upon which the suspension shall terminate or renewal shall be
granted. Where there has been a violation or conviction within one (1)
year from the date of service of notice of violation and the violation is
repeated or remains unabated, resulting in a second notice of violation or
conviction thereof in the Municipal Court, the Public Officer may thereafter
permanently revoke the license or refuse renewal thereof without

ARTICLE IX
Appointment of Public Officer; Inspections; Abatement of Violations
§ 156-65. Appointment of Public Officer.
The Director of the Building Inspections and Code Enforcement Department
shall designate and appoint the Public Officer, and all inspections,
regulations, enforcement and hearings on violations of the provisions of this
code, unless expressly stated to the contrary, shall be under the direction
and supervision of the Public Officer. The Public Officer may appoint or
designate such other public officials or employees of the city to perform
duties as may be necessary to the enforcement of this code, including the
making of inspections and holding of hearings.
§ 156-66. Inspections.
A. When inspections are to be made.
(1) Residential. All buildings and premises subject to this code are
subject to inspections from time to time by the enforcing officer of
the city. At the time of such inspections, all rooms in the building
and all parts of the premises must be available and accessible for
such inspections, and the owner, operator and occupant are
required to provide the necessary arrangements to facilitate such
inspections. Such inspections shall be made between 8:00 a.m. and
4:00 p.m., unless one (1) of the following conditions exists:
(a) The premises are not available during the foregoing hours for
inspections.
(b) There is reason to believe that violations are occurring on the
premises which can only be apprehended and proven by
inspections during other than the prescribed hours or which
require immediate inspection after being reported, such as
failure to supply heat.
(c) There is reason to believe there exists a violation of a character
which is an immediate threat to health or safety requiring
inspection and abatement without delay.
(2) Nonresidential. All buildings and premises subject to this code are
subject to inspection from time to time by the enforcing officer. At
the time for such inspections, all rooms and parts of the premises
must be available and accessible for such inspections, and the
owner and operator are required to provide the necessary
arrangements to facilitate such inspections. Such inspections shall
be made during regular open hours of the business occupying the
premises unless there is reason to believe a violation exists of a
character which is an immediate threat to health or safety
requiring inspection and abatement without delay.
§ 156-65 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 156-66
1:725
B. Identification and conduct of inspectors. Inspectors shall be supplied
with official identification and, upon request, shall exhibit such
identification when entering any dwelling unit, rooming unit or any part
of any premises subject to this code. Inspectors shall conduct
themselves so as to avoid intentional embarrassment or inconvenience
to occupants.
C. Where entry by inspectors is refused.
(1) Emergency inspection without warrant. Emergency inspections
may be authorized without warrant if the Public Officer has reason
to believe that a condition exists which poses an immediate threat
to life, health or safety. Such procedure shall only take place where
the time taken to apply for and secure the issuance of a warrant
would render ineffective the immediate action necessary to abate
the condition. Where the Public Officer or his agent is refused entry
or access or is otherwise impeded or prevented by the owner,
occupant or operator from conducting an inspection of the
premises, such person shall be in violation of this code and subject
to the penalties hereunder.
(2) Search warrant or access warrant.
(a) The Public Officer may, upon affidavit, apply to the Judge of the
Municipal Court of the City of Orange for a search warrant
setting forth factually the actual conditions and circumstances
that provide a reasonable basis for believing that a nuisance or
violation of the code may exist on the premises, including one
(1) or more of the following:
[1] That the premises require inspection according to the
cycle established by the city for periodic inspections of
premises of the type involved.
[2] That observation of the external condition of the premises
and its public areas has resulted in the belief that
violations of this code exist.
[3] That there are circumstances such as age of the building,
type of building, particular use of premises or other factors
which render systematic inspections of such buildings
necessary in the interest of public health and safety.
(b) If the Judge of the Municipal Court of the City of Orange is
satisfied as to the matter set forth in the affidavit, he shall
authorize the issuance of a search warrant permitting access
to an inspection of that part of the premises on which the
nuisance or violation may exist. Warrant for access may be
issued by the Judge of the Municipal Court of the City of
Orange upon affidavit of the Public Officer establishing
grounds therefor pursuant to § 156-78.
§ 156-66 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 156-66
1:726
§ 156-67. Abatement of violations.
Except as provided in Subsection J below, where a violation of this code
or the regulations hereunder is found to exist, a written notice from the
Public Officer shall be served on the person or persons responsible for the
correction thereof.
(3) Search warrant for area inspection. In addition to the provisions of
Subsection C(2) above, the Public Officer may, upon affidavit, apply
to the Judge of the Municipal Court of the City of Orange for a
search warrant to conduct an area inspection as that term is
defined in § 156-4.
A. Contents of notice. The notice shall specify the violation or violations
committed, what must be done to correct same, a reasonable period of
time not to exceed thirty (30) days to correct or abate the violation, the
right of the person served to request a hearing, and that the notice shall
become an order of the Public Officer in ten (10) days after service
unless a hearing is requested pursuant to Subsection C hereof.
B. Service of notice. Notice may be served personally or by prepaid
telegram or by mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the last known
address of the person to be served. In the case of an occupant, notice
may be posted upon the door of his dwelling unit or rooming unit.
Where it is ascertained that the owner does not reside on the premises,
the last known address shall be the address of the owner as shown in
the office of the Tax Collector. If the last known address cannot be
ascertained, the notice may be posted on the outside front entrance of
the building. The Public Officer shall file and provide notice to any
owner, operator or occupant of any violation at any address other than
the last known address provided hereunder if such other address is
filed with the Public Officer personally or by certified mail addressed to
the Public Officer. Service upon an owner, operator or occupant may
also be attained by service of any notice upon a member of the family of
the owner, operator or occupant. Date of service of the notice shall be
determined, where service is by mail, as of the day following the day of
mailing for notices to addresses within the city, and as of the fourth day
after the day of mailing for notices to addresses outside the city. Where
the day of service would fall upon a Sunday or other day when mail is
not ordinarily delivered, then the day of service shall be the next
regular delivery day. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein
contained where premises are subject to registration pursuant to
§ 156-88 and have been so registered, notice served upon the agent
designated therein shall constitute service upon the owner, operator
and lessor of the premises jointly and severally. Where the owner,
operator or lessor has failed to register the premises as required under
§ 156-88, or if the present premises have been registered and if the
agent designated therein cannot be found at the address given in the
registration, the owner, operator or lessor affected thereby may be
§ 156-66 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 156-67
1:727
served by posting notice upon the premises in a conspicuous place as
near as possible to the front entrance thereof.
C. [Repealed 12-6-2005 by Ord. No. 35-2005]
D. Determination at hearing. At any hearing provided hereunder, the
Public Officer shall be vested with all the powers provided by law to
compel the attendance of witnesses and parties in interest by issuance
and service of subpoena, to require by subpoena the production of
books, records or other documents at any such hearing which may be
pertinent to matters to be determined by him and to enforce any such
subpoena or secure any order for the enforcement of any such
subpoena as provided by law. Determination shall be made within ten
(10) days from the completion of the hearing. The Public Officer shall
issue an order either incorporating the determinations and directions
contained in the notice, modifying the same or withdrawing the notice.
E. Extensions of time. The Public Officer may extend the time for
correction or abatement of the violations for an additional period of
time not to exceed thirty (30) days, except where major capital
improvements or renovations are involved, in which instance the time
for completion may be extended for a period not to exceed ninety (90)
days beyond the expiration date of the original notice.
F. Summary abatement in emergency; notice and hearing not required.
Where the violation or condition existing on the premises are of such a
nature as to constitute an immediate threat to life and limb unless
abated without delay, the Public Officer may either abate the violation
or condition immediately or order the owner, operator or occupant to
correct the violation or condition within a period of time not to exceed
three (3) days, and, upon failure to do so, the Public Officer shall abate
the condition immediately thereafter.
G. Cost of abatement to be a lien against premises. Where abatement of
any nuisance as defined herein, correction of a defect in the premises or
the maintenance of the premises in a proper condition so as to conform
to municipal ordinances or state law applicable thereto requires
expending city moneys therefor, the Public Officer shall present a
report of work proposed to be done to accomplish the foregoing to the
City Council with an estimate of the cost thereof, along with a summary
of the proceedings undertaken by the Public Officer to secure
compliance, including notices served upon the owners, operators,
lessors or agents, as the case may be, hearings and orders of the Public
Officer with reference thereto. The City Council may thereupon by
resolution authorize the abatement of the nuisance, correction of the
defect or work necessary to place the premises in proper condition and
in compliance with ordinances of the city and laws of the state. The
Public Officer may thereafter proceed to have the work performed in
accordance with the resolution at city expense, not to exceed the
amount specified in the resolution, and shall, upon completion thereof,
submit a report of the moneys expended and costs to the City Council.
§ 156-67 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 156-67
1:728
After review of the same, the City Council may approve the expenses
and costs, whereupon the same shall become a lien against the
premises collectible as provided by law. A copy of the resolution
approving the expenses and costs shall be certified by the City Council
and filed with the Tax Collector of the city, who shall be responsible for
the collection thereof, and a copy of this report and resolution shall be
sent by certified mail to the owner.
H. Referral of violations. Any violation of any ordinance other than this
code discovered by a housing inspector shall be reported to the Public
Officer, who shall refer the alleged violation to the official or agency
responsible for the enforcement of such other ordinance.
I. Extension of time where dispossess action undertaken. Where there
exists a violation of occupancy standards hereunder, an owner or
operator, upon receipt of a notice of violation, if unable to eliminate the
violation by peaceable means within the period of time specified in the
notice, shall commence within such period legal action to dispossess,
evict or eject the occupants who cause the violation. No further action
hereunder shall then be taken against the owner or operator so long as
the action aforesaid is pending in the court and is prosecuted
expeditiously and in good faith.
J. Where notice and hearing not required prior to court proceedings.
(1) Notwithstanding the requirements of Subsections A through D
hereof, violations of the following sections may be prosecuted
without notice by the filing of a complaint by the Public Officer and/
or inspectors in the Municipal Court: §§ 156-13, 156-17, 156-19,
156-20A, B, O through U and X(3), 156-23, 156-29, 156-30, 156-43,
156-83 and 156-88. [Amended 12-19-78 by Ord. No. 48-78]
(2) No notice shall be required on the enforcement of § 156-13D hereof
as to the removal of accumulated snow or ice from paths, walks,
driveways, parking lots and parking areas used by pedestrians and
automobiles where such snow or ice remain uncleared within eight
(8) hours of daylight after the termination of the snowfall.
(3) The Public Officer after hearing shall determine that there was a
violation and a notice was served upon the owner, operator or
occupant, whether or not the violation was abated prior to the
issuance of an order, if thereafter within the space of one (1) year
there shall be a second violation by the same owner, operator or
occupant of the same provision of this code discovered on the same
premises, the offender may be prosecuted on the second violation
without the Public Officer first giving notice and opportunity for a
hearing to the owner, operator or occupant by the filing of a
complaint by the Public Officer in the Municipal Court. Where the
Public Officer has on two (2) different occasions found violations by
the same owner, operator or occupant on the same premises and
has issued notices on each and has held at least one (1) hearing and
§ 156-67 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 156-67
1:729
issued an order thereon, upon discovering a third or subsequent
violation by the same owner, operator or occupant on the same
premises within the space of one (1) year, whether the same
sections or of any other sections of this code, he may thereupon
prosecute the offender by filing a complaint in the Municipal Court
for the third or subsequent violation occurring within the period
of one (1) year without first providing notice and opportunity for a
hearing by the Public Officer.
K. Effect of notice on owner. For the purposes of enforcement of this code,
the service of a notice on an owner, whether or not the owner is also the
operator, shall constitute notice of violations set forth therein until the
violations are abated in conformity with this code and the other
applicable ordinances of the City of Orange.
L. Public Officer may act as custodian. In addition to other remedies
provided herein where the Public Officer has issued an order requiring
the abatement of the nuisance, correction of a defective condition or
the maintenance of the premises in a proper condition so as to conform
to the ordinances of the city and laws of the state applicable thereto and
the owner, operator, lessor or agent charged with the premises has
failed to comply therewith, the Public Officer may for the purpose of
correcting any of the foregoing conditions, act as custodian of any
building or structure subject to registration in accordance with the
provisions of § 156-88 and may, as custodian, enter into and take charge
of the premises and supervise the abatement of any nuisance,
correction of defect or placing of the premises in compliance with
municipal ordinances and state laws. For the performance of the duties
of custodian, the City of Orange shall receive for the services from the
owner, operator and lessor of the premises the compensation approved
by the City Council and set forth in Chapter 88, Fees, as costs and
expenses, the same to be certified and collected as provided in
§ 156-67G. [Amended 5-18-1982 by Ord. No. 16-82]
M. Appointment of receiver. Where the owner, operator or lessor of the
building who is required to register under § 156-88 violates this code or
any other municipal ordinance pertaining to the structure or fails to
abate any violation of this code or violates an order of the Public Officer
with respect thereto, the Public Officer, upon resolution duly approved
by the City Council, may commence an action in the Superior Court
seeking appointment of the Public Officer as receiver ex officio of the
rents and income from the property. The rents and income shall be
collected by the receiver and shall be expended and allotted to:
(1) Secure compliance with the ordinances of the city and laws of the
state as set forth in the order of the Public Officer.
(2) Be utilized to defray such costs and expenses of the receivership as
may be adjudged by the Superior Court.
§ 156-67 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 156-67
1:730
(3) Be applied towards payment to the city of any fines or penalties
with costs which may have been imposed on the owner, operator or
lessor for violation of the ordinances of the city and which have
remained unpaid.
N. Mortgagee as agent. The Public Officer, when acting as receiver as
heretofore provided, may when authorized by resolution of the City
Council, appoint as agent the holder of any first mortgage upon the
premises if such mortgagee or assignee of the mortgage is a proper
person and is willing to accept such appointment to serve as agent to
the receiver for the purpose of collecting rent and income from the
premises and manage the same. If there is no first mortgage or
assignee of the mortgage, or if such person is unsuitable or unqualified
for performing duties as set forth herein or is unwilling to accept
appointment, the City Council may, by resolution upon recommendation
to the Public Officer, designate some other person to perform the
aforesaid duties and functions, and the agent shall account promptly to
the receiver for the rent and income so collected; provided, however,
that if the mortgagee or other person so designated is derelict in
collecting or accounting for such rents and income or in the
management of such real property, the receiver shall apply to the court
for the removal of such designated mortgagee or other person, upon
notice in writing to him, and the court upon removing such designated
mortgagee or other person, in its discretion, may designate another
person to collect the rents and income from such real property and
manage the same and account to the receiver for the rents and income
of such real property as aforesaid.
O. Fee of receiver or counsel. In any such receivership, no fees shall be
allowed the receiver or his counsel for acting as such receiver or
counsel.
P. Procedure in respect to receivership. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the procedure in respect to any such receivership provided by
this code shall be as in the case of receiverships to secure the payment
of delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, costs and expenses.
Q. Interference with duties of city officers. Where the Public Officer has
assumed responsibility as custodian or the court pursuant to this code
has designated a receiver, any interference with or refusal to comply
with the requests of the officers in the performance of their duties as
provided herein shall constitute a violation of this code.
§ 156-67 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 156-67

ARTICLE X
Powers and Duties of Public Officer
§ 156-68. Adoption of rules and regulations.
The Public Officer is hereby authorized and empowered to promulgate
such written rules and regulations as may be necessary for the proper
interpretation and administration of the provisions of this code, provided
that such rules and regulations do not conflict with this code and conform
to the general standards prescribed by this code. The Public Officer shall
file copies of such rules and regulations with the City Clerk, Health Officer,
City Engineer and Fire Chief and shall make available in the Public Officer's
office a copy for inspection by members of the public during regular
business hours. Such rules and regulations shall have the approval of
the Health Officer, City Engineer and Fire Chief, respectively, where the
provisions thereof relate to matters which are also in the jurisdiction and
supervision of each officer. In case of conflict, the rule or regulation may
be promulgated by direction of the Mayor. Such rules and regulations shall
have the same force and effect as the provisions of this code, and the
violations thereof shall be enforced as violations of the express provisions
of this code, as herein provided.
§ 156-69. Modification and variance of code provisions.
A. The Public Officer shall have the power to withhold strict enforcement
of the requirements of this code upon written application therefor by an
owner, operator or occupant, after making determination that:
(1) Any variation or modification of a structure or use approved by the
Public Officer will not in any material way alter the standards of
this code and cannot affect detrimentally the health or safety of
occupants of the premises or the health, safety or welfare of the
occupants or owners of adjacent premises or of the neighborhood.
(2) Strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary
hardship on the owner, operator or occupant because it would
compel expenditures on the premises which would be substantially
disproportionate to any benefit to health, safety or welfare that
might be derived therefrom.
(3) The owner, operator or occupant is without any practical or feasible
means to comply with the strict provisions of this code.
(4) The strict enforcement of the provisions of this code would require
the installation of repairs and improvements estimated to exceed
three hundred dollars ($300.) in cost, and the premises subject to
this code are contemplated for acquisition or are within an area
where acquisition is contemplated by a public agency having the
power of eminent domain and there is a reasonable likelihood that
the premises will be acquired within a period of two (2) years;
provided, however, that any waiver of the provisions of this code
§ 156-68 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 156-69
1:733
§ 156-70. Review of code provisions and operations.
The Public Officer shall, on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of
each year, review with the Fire Chief, Health Officer, City Engineer, Housing
Director and the City Council the procedure and operation of this code and
report to the Mayor and City Council immediately after such review:
shall be canceled and the Public Officer shall strictly enforce the
code if it shall be ascertained subsequent to the granting of the
waiver that the premises are in fact not to be acquired for any
public use or purpose.
(5) The strict compliance with this code would require substantial
structural changes to the premises, and the nonconformity is of a
technical and insubstantial character or there is an alternative
means satisfactory to the Public Officer to be used, which will
eliminate violations of this code constituting hazards to the health,
safety and welfare of the occupants of the premises and persons in
the immediate vicinity thereof.
B. Right to hearing; application not a defense; record of modifications.
(1) Right to hearing where application denied. Upon denial of any such
application, the owner, operator or applicant may request a hearing
which shall be held in accordance with the provisions of § 156-67C.
(2) Application not to constitute a defense or stay. Such application
shall not constitute a defense of any violation of this code
concerning which any proceedings are pending in the Municipal
Court when the application is filed, nor shall any variance or
modification allowed hereunder constitute a vested right against
any ordinance enacted hereinafter by the City Council compelling
strict enforcement of any provisions of this code.
(3) Record of variations or modifications granted. Where variations or
modifications are approved of any section of this code by the Public
Officer or by action of any court, a written record thereof stating
the name of the applicant, the address of the premises, the
variation or modification approved, date of approval and the
reasons therefor, satisfying the provisions contained herein, shall
be prepared by the Public Officer and filed both under the section
or sections of this code to which the variation or modification
applies and under the address of the premises, and such files shall
be available for public inspection in the office of the Public Officer
during regular business hours.
A. Any recommended amendment, addition or modification of provisions
of this code consonant with the field experience of the personnel
charged with enforcement.
B. A summary of the enforcement experience indicating number of
violations abated, number of cases processed in the Municipal Court,
§ 156-69 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 156-70
1:734
number of inspections made and such other and further pertinent
information as will provide the Mayor and City Council with an account
of progress in securing the standards required by this code.
C. Any further recommendation as to how the code and the procedure and
operations thereunder can be improved.
§ 156-70 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 156-70
1:735

ARTICLE XI
Inspection and Status Reports
§ 156-71. Application for inspection reports.
Whenever an owner, operator, occupant, prospective purchaser, mortgagee
or prospective occupant shall apply to the Public Officer for an inspection
in order to ascertain if any section of this code has been violated, the Public
Officer shall, upon payment of the fee hereunder stated, cause an inspection
to be made of the premises and issue an informational certificate or report
of the inspections to the applicant, indicating therein any violations of
this code on the premises. The applicant for such inspection shall state in
writing his full name, residence and the reasons and basis for which the
inspection is requested. The Public Officer may deny the application for
failure to comply with this requirement.
§ 156-72. Application for status reports.
Where, in lieu of an inspection, an owner, operator, occupant, lessee,
prospective purchaser, mortgagee or prospective occupant requests a
status report as to whether or not there are any known violations presently
pending on the premises, upon payment of the fee prescribed herein, a copy
of any notice or order on any violation then pending shall be sent to the
applicant.
§ 156-73. Purpose and scope.
No inspection report issued under § 156-71 above or status report under
§ 156-72 above shall be construed as providing a defense against any
violation of this code or any other ordinance of the city which may be
discovered thereafter, whether or not the condition or violation existed at
the time of any such inspection or status report. The inspection or status
report is provided as a convenience to the public and shall not constitute
a limitation on the full enforcement of this code. The inspection or status
report shall include only such matters as are embraced in this code.
§ 156-74. Fees. [Amended 11-15-71 by Ord. No. 51-71; 4-16-74 by
Ord. No. 28-74]
A. The fee for any inspection made under § 156-71 above shall be as
provided in Chapter 88, Fees. [Amended 5-18-1982 by Ord. No.
16-82]
B. Whenever an inspection appointment is broken by the purchaser,
mortgagee or any other party in interest so that there must be another
trip to the premises by the house inspector, said person ordering said
inspection shall be required to pay another inspection fee.
§ 156-71 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 156-74
1:737

ARTICLE XII
Certificates of Necessity
§ 156-75. Who may apply.
Where any owner, operator or occupant is required to make repairs or
otherwise improve his property and is unable to comply with this code
without having right of access to the building or premises through or across
adjoining premises not owned by him or under his control and where right
of access has been refused the owner, operator or occupant or where the
owner or person responsible for granting permission cannot be found or
located, then upon filing of affidavit setting forth the facts with the Public
Officer, the Public Officer shall serve a five-day written notice of a hearing
in accordance with the provisions for service contained in § 156-67A upon
the owner, operator or occupant of any adjoining premises affected by the
application.
§ 156-76. Hearing.
On the day fixed for hearing, the Public Officer shall provide opportunity
for the owner, operator or occupant of the adjoining properties to state why
access should not be granted across the adjoining properties.
§ 156-77. Issuance; conditions; bond.
If the Public Officer determines that access is necessary to accomplish
or complete repairs or improvements necessary for compliance with this
code, then the Public Officer shall issue a certificate of necessity setting
forth therein the person or persons to whom the certificate shall apply,
such conditions as shall be necessary to protect the adjoining property,
reasonable time limits during which such certificate shall operate,
precautions to be taken to avoid damage and, where the Public Officer
deems proper, that a bond be procured at the expense of any persons
seeking access to secure the adjoining property against damage to persons
or property arising out of such rights of access. The bond shall not exceed in
amount ten thousand dollars ($10,000.) and the amount set shall take into
consideration the extent, nature and duration of the repairs, the proximity
of the improvement on the premises affected and the potential risk of
damage thereto. The bond shall be filed with the Public Officer.
§ 156-78. Refusal of access to constitute violation; warrant.
Any refusal to comply with this Article or any interference with access to
premises pursuant to a certificate issued hereunder shall be a violation
of this code, and, in addition to penalties provided hereunder, the Public
Officer may, upon affidavit, apply to the Judge for a warrant under the
procedures set forth in § 156-66C(2) authorizing access to the premises
under appropriate conditions and circumstances as provided under
§ 156-77 above.
§ 156-75 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 156-78
1:739

ARTICLE XIII
Unfit Buildings
§ 156-79. Filing of complaints; notification of owner; hearing.
Whenever a petition is filed with the Public Officer by a public authority
or by at least five (5) residents of the City of Orange charging that any
building is unfit for human habitation or occupancy or use whenever it
appears to the Public Officer, on his own motion, that any building is unfit
for human habitation, occupancy or use, the Public Officer shall, if his
preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause
to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such building a
complaint stating the charges in that respect and containing a notice that
a hearing will be held before the Public Officer at his office in Orange City
Hall on a date therein fixed, which shall be not less than ten (10) nor more
than thirty (30) days after service of the complaint and notice.
§ 156-80. Basis for determination of unfitness.
In making a determination of whether a building is unfit for human
habitation or use, the Public Officer shall determine whether, by reason
of violations of this code existing in the building or on the premises, the
continued occupancy of the building will endanger and jeopardize the
health and safety of the occupants or persons in the vicinity of the premises,
and to that end he may consider, among other factors:
A. Whether the premises are so structurally defective that there is a risk of
collapse or of loose materials falling and injuring persons in and around
the building.
B. Whether by reason of inadequate ventilation there is a danger of
communicable diseases being contracted and spread in and among the
occupants or persons in the vicinity of the premises.
C. Whether by reason of infestation or defective condition of plumbing, or
the lack of maintenance of halls, floors, walls or other parts of the
premises, conditions exist which are conducive to the contracting and
spreading of diseases.

Superior Court to contest the reasonableness of the amount or the accuracy
of the costs set forth in the lien certificate.

under this chapter are found on particular premises and by reason of
the same the Public Officer finds reason to doubt the qualifications,
competence or sense of responsibility of the superintendent, the Public
Officer shall provide notice of same to the owner, operator and
superintendent and hold a hearing to determine if the license of the
superintendent shall be suspended or revoked; and, upon making such
determination, the Public Officer shall order the owner or operator to

Abandoned Property
[Added 5-4-2004 by Ord. No. 13-2004]
§ 156-97. Defined; criteria for declaring abandoned.
An abandoned property is hereby defined as one that has not been legally
occupied for a period of six (6) months and meets one of the following
criteria:
§ 156-98. Municipal acquisition of abandoned property.
A. The property is in need of rehabilitation and has not been rehabilitated
during the unoccupied period,
B. Construction has been initiated on the property in the past, but not for
the six (6) month period,
C. The property has been in tax arrearage for at least one installment
period, or
D. The property has been determined to be a nuisance by the public officer
(nuisance includes a finding that the property is unfit for human
habitation and/or is determined to be a fire hazard or potential health
and safety hazard).
A. The procedures for municipal acquisition of the abandoned property
shall be that which is set forth in Assembly Bill substitute for 2543. This
shall include the filing of a complaint in the Superior Court of New
Jersey with a certification by the public officer that the property is
abandoned. Thirty (30) days notice must be provided to the owner prior
to the filing of a complaint.
B. The owner may defend against the complaint by submitting a plan for
the rehabilitation and reuse of the property and by posting a bond equal
to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the amount determined
by the public officer (Director of Planning and Development or his
designee) to represent the project cost of rehabilitation. The plan
requires a financial feasibility analysis, a budget and timetable for
rehabilitation of the property and documentation of qualifications of
those who will perform the rehabilitation.
C. The Court shall approve the plan if the plan is realistic and likely to
result in the expeditious rehabilitation and reuse of the property and,
correspondingly, the Court shall disapprove of the plan if unrealistic. If
the Court approves the owner's plan, it may appoint the public officer to
act as monitor of the owner's compliance. If the owner fails to carry out
any step in the approved plan, the public officer shall notify the Court,
which may order to bond forfeit, grant the municipality possession of
the property, and authorize the municipality to use the proceeds of the
bond for rehabilitation of the property.
§ 156-97 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 156-98
1:757
D. The owner shall provide quarterly reports to the municipality and the
Court on the owner's progress toward rehabilitation and reuse of the
property.
E. If an owner fails to successfully defend against a complaint, a mortgage
holder or lien holder may seek to be designated in possession for the
property by submitting a plan and posting a bond meeting the same
conditions described above. If no mortgage holder or lien holder meets
these conditions, the municipality shall submit a plan which shall
designate an entity that shall implement the plan. This entity may be
the municipality or a qualified rehabilitation entity, organized or
authorized to do business under New Jersey law, which shall have as
one of its purposes the construction or rehabilitation of residential or
nonresidential buildings, the provision of affordable housing and the
restoration of abandoned property, among others.
F. If the municipality is granted possession of a property under this
Article, the municipality shall be deemed to have an ownership interest
in the property for the purpose of filing plans with public agencies and
any state program of grants or loans. Where the municipality borrows
funds for the express purpose of rehabilitating the property, the Court
may authorize the municipality to grant a lien or security interest with
priority over all other liens or mortgages other than municipal liens.
G. With the granting of possession by the Court to a municipality of a
property determined to be abandoned, the owner shall continue to be
responsible for all taxes or other municipal liens and charges, or
mortgages or liens to any party, incurred on the property, whether those
taxes, charges or liens are incurred before or after the granting of
possession. Nor shall the owner be relieved of any operating or
maintenance expense associated with the property. Similarly, although
the municipality is required to maintain, safeguard, and maintain
insurance on the property, the owner shall not be relieved of any civil or
criminal liability or any duty imposed by reason of acts or omissions of
the owner relating to the property.
H. The municipality is authorized to seek Court approval to assign its
rights to another entity, which may be granted under the circumstances
enumerated in this Article.
I. An owner may petition for reinstatement of the owner's control and
possession of the property. The petition's requirements and conditions
shall be determined by the Court for reinstating the owner's rights.
J. If the municipality sells the property, this Article sets forth the order of
distribution of the proceeds of such a sale. This Article authorizes the
public officer, with the approval of the Court, to place a lien on the
property to cover any costs of the municipality incurred prior to the
granting by the Court of an order of possession, which may include
costs incurred to stabilize or secure the property.
§ 156-98 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 156-98
1:758
K. This Article authorizes municipalities to hold special tax sales with
respect to those properties eligible for tax sale under R.S. 54:5-19
which are also on an abandoned property list and sets forth procedures
governing those special tax sales. In the case of any eminent domain
proceeding carried out under section 37 of P.L. 1966, c. 62 (C.
55:19-56), this Article establishes the parameters for establishing fair
market value.

Truth-In-Renting Act
[Adopted 3-18-08 as Ord. No. 3-2008]
§ 156-101. Requirements.
The Truth-In-Renting Act requires that the Department of Community
Affairs shall prepare and make available, at cost, an informational statement
of the primary clearly established rights and responsibilities of tenants and
landlords of rental dwelling units.
Every landlord of residential premises subject to the Act must distribute a
copy of the statement to each tenant within thirty (30) days. Additionally, at
least one (1) current copy of the statement must be posted in a prominent
location accessible to all the tenants of the rental premises. Furthermore
no landlord subject to the Act may enter into or offer to any tenant or
prospective tenant any written lease which includes a lease provision which
violates clearly established legal rights of tenants or responsibilities of
landlords as established by the law of New Jersey at the time the lease is
signed. A tenant may petition a court to terminate a lease containing any
lease provision contrary to the requirements of the Act unless the improper
lease provision was originally proposed by the tenant. The landlord's
responsibilities under this Act are not altered by any tenant's waiver or
refusal of the right to receive a copy of the statement. Any landlord who
violates any provision of the statute shall be liable to a penalty of up to one
hundred dollars ($100.) for each offense.

Ord. No. 43-2018]
Establishment of rents between a landlord and a tenant to whom this
chapter is applicable shall hereafter be determined by the provisions of
this chapter. Except for properties rented to qualified senior tenants, at the
Leveling. The application of the landlord shall be attached to the
decision. A copy of the decision only shall be sent or personally served
upon the applicant or any interested or affected party. The Office of
Rent Leveling shall review the decision of the Hearing Officer only as to
form and content and shall make arrangements that the applicant and
interested or affected parties are notified of the decision.
D. The Hearing Officer, having been delegated those duties set forth in this

interest or has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or
personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the
proceeding, or when the Hearing Officer is individually or a spouse or a
minor child is residing in his or her household, has a financial interest in

applicant or any interested or affected party.
§ 166-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 166-8
1:779
expiration of a lease or at the termination of a lease of a periodic tenant
(for less than one year), no landlord may request or receive an increase in
rent that is greater than 5% per annum; except that, for those tenants who
supply their own heat, the increase shall be 4% per annum. For a qualified
senior tenant, said landlord shall not seek or demand an increase in rent
which exceeds 2% of the rent charged during the preceding twelve-month
period. In an apartment that contains multiple persons, the 2% cap shall
only apply if a qualified senior tenant is identified on the lease as a tenant
in the subject apartment.
A. For a year-to-year tenant or for a tenant under a lease term in excess of
one year, the landlord, owner or agent shall not seek or demand an
increase in rent which exceeds the percentage of the prior rent for each
twelve-month period the existing lease has been in effect.
B. No more than one such rental increase in any one twelve-month period
shall be permitted, irrespective of the number of different tenants
occupying the housing unit during a twelve-month period, except as
otherwise provided by this chapter. Any renewal increase at any other
time, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be voided.
C. The landlord shall supply and deliver to either a new tenant or to one
from whom it seeks an increase information, in writing, which shall
state the rent paid by all tenants who occupied the apartment unit
during the prior twelve-month period, that the landlord has complied
with the provisions of § 166-17 (Recording and registering rents), the
annual percentage for which an increase is sought and the calculation
reflecting the new rent. No rental increase of any amount or percentage
shall be demanded, received or accepted unless the landlord has
complied fully with the provisions of § 166-17 (Recording and
registering rents). In the event that a landlord, at the time he demands
a rental increase from a tenant, fails to have a current rent roll on file,
he shall be precluded from obtaining any increase from the tenant until
such time as the current rents are registered and filed with the Office of
Rent Leveling.
D. The landlord shall include in the notice as referred to in Subsection C
above a certification that the dwelling and housing unit is in substantial
compliance with the applicable Property Maintenance Code of the City
of Orange Township (Chapter 156), its amendments and supplements
thereto.
E. A complaint of a tenant challenging the propriety of any increase based
upon a violation of this section shall be filed within six weeks from the
date when the proposed increase is to take effect. The Rent Leveling
Board, for good cause shown, such as, but not limited to, the disability
of the tenant, a physical or mental impairment, harassment,
intimidation or coercion by the landlord, its agents or representatives,
or if the landlord does not inform or misinforms a tenant concerning the
previous rent paid and/or the proper calculation of the rental increase
§ 166-8 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 166-8
1:780
or an unusual hardship, may waive the six-week period and accept, hear
and adjudicate a complaint of an illegal increase.
F. The limitations of rental increases in this section shall be applied to any
rent increase to become effective on or after January 1, 1987, and any
renewal or new leases or tenancies as of that date shall reflect a
monthly rent consistent with this section.
G. Rents increased, paid or collected on or after the effective date of this
chapter shall reflect an increase of no more than that allowed under
this section. Those rents paid over and above the allowable rent for any
apartment unit shall be credited to the tenant as a reduction in rent in
the following month following the effective date of this chapter; or, in
the case of a tenant who has moved, the excess moneys paid shall be
sent to the former tenant within 30 days of enactment by law of this
section.
H. All limitations on rental increases as applied to housing space under the
above subsections also apply as limitations on rental increases for
parking spaces. All notice requirements, time limitations and other
applicable duties or obligations of the landlord as set forth in this
chapter are hereby made applicable to increases in rent for parking
spaces. The aggregate amount of rent and parking charges for new and
existing tenants in rent-controlled units shall not exceed the allowable
annual increase under this chapter. New tenants in decontrolled units
may be charged a separate fee for one or more parking spaces. Once
under rent control, the aggregate amount of rent and parking charges
may not exceed the allowable annual increase under this chapter.
I. It shall be unlawful for any landlord to charge a tenant for the use of a
washing machine, refrigerator, cooking stove, air conditioner or any
other privileges or amenities, including, but not limited to, parking
spaces, when and wherever such appliances, privileges or amenities
were previously provided, permitted and allowed to that tenant by the
landlord without extra charge, either by lease, use or custom. The use
of such appliances, privileges or amenities in connection with the use or
occupancy of the dwelling unit shall be considered as included in the
rent. Any extra charge in such a situation shall be considered as an
unauthorized increase in rent and shall be unlawful, unless, upon good
cause, it is approved by the Rent Leveling Board.
J. In the event that a landlord voluntarily determines to reduce the rent
charge for a housing space or unit or otherwise determines not to
increase the rent by the maximum amount set forth in this section, such
landlord shall not be deemed to have waived the right to reinstate the
rent charge immediately prior to such reduction and to add on
whatever annual permissible increase he would have been entitled to;
provided, however, that the landlord, within 30 days after such
determination, shall notify the affected tenant and the Office of Rent
Leveling, in writing, of such rent reduction and/or permissible rent
increase not previously charged; provided further, however, that
§ 166-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 166-8
1:781
§ 166-9. Excessive rental increase; adjustment.
A rental increase which exceeds that allowed by this chapter may be voided
in its entirety by the Rent Leveling Board and shall be adjusted by the Rent
Leveling Board to conform to the amount allowed by this chapter. Such
adjustment may be made prior to a hearing before the Rent Leveling Board
by the Office of Rent Leveling in the form of an informal conference and
upon notice to all parties. Any adjustment by the Office of Rent Leveling
shall be reduced to writing and confirmed by the Rent Leveling Board. Any
rental increases in excess of that allowed by this chapter and paid by the
tenant may be returned to the tenant or credited off of future months rent.
§ 166-10. Capital improvement and surcharge applications;
preliminary and final approval.
A landlord shall submit an application to the Office of Rent Leveling for
an additional surcharge due to capital improvements to the housing space
or dwelling unit or for improved or increased services or nonmaintenance
or replacement improvements to property mandated by state statute or
regulation or ordinance.
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the landlord shall
not be permitted to increase the rent on account of a voluntary rent
reduction or the forbearance of any otherwise permissible rent increase
that occurred more than two years earlier.
K. No landlord of a dwelling or housing space subject to this chapter shall
serve a notice to quit upon any tenant or institute any action against a
tenant to recover the possession of a dwelling unit or housing space in
reprisal for the tenant's efforts to secure or enforce any rights granted
under this chapter or any other ordinance, law or regulation of the City
or State of New Jersey or the United States of America or on account of
the landlord's failure to obtain the approval of any application or
petition for a rent increase, surcharge or exemption. The institution of
any proceeding by a landlord, its agent or representative against a
tenant or the receipt by the tenant of a notice to quit or any substantial
alteration of the terms of the tenancy without cause after the tenant
attempts to secure or enforce its rights, or if the landlord has failed to
obtain approval of any application, shall create a rebuttable
presumption that the landlord's action is a reprisal against the tenant.
L. A violation of Subsection K shall be punishable as prescribed in
§ 166-25 but in no way shall be limited to the tenant's rights set forth in
N.J.S.A. 2A:42-10.10 or any other cause of action authorized by statute.
M. No capital improvement surcharge pursuant to § 166-10 or any other
allowable increase, except for the annual percentage increase and a
hardship increase, shall be deemed to constitute rent for the purposes
of computing the permissible annual rent increase pursuant to § 166-8
hereof.
§ 166-8 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 166-10
1:782
A. Preliminary hearing. A landlord may, prior to undertaking an
expenditure for a capital improvement or improved or increased
services, or services mandated by statute, regulation or ordinance, seek
preliminary approval by filing an application with the Office of Rent
Leveling. The application shall be forwarded to the Hearing Officer,
who shall conduct a preliminary review hearing as to whether and to
what extent and benefit the proposed expenditure would be covered by
this section. No expenditure as to dollar amount shall increase the rent
of any tenant until the capital improvement or surcharge which
received preliminary approval is supported by documentation,
including canceled checks, receipts, bills, vouchers and/or estimates.
No capital improvement surcharge or other surcharges shall be
effective until the improvement or increased services are completed
and subject to a final hearing before the Hearing Officer.
B. The Hearing Officer shall hold a public hearing on the landlord's
application either for preliminary approval or final approval. At least
ten (10) days prior to the public hearing, the landlord shall notify each
tenant by certified mail or by personal service (return receipt requested
forms are not required) as to the date, time and place of the hearing.
Certified mail receipts must bear the name of each tenant so served and
be hand canceled by the post office with a postmark date clearly visible.
This notice shall also state, for capital improvements and
nonmaintenance or replacement improvements or increased or
improved services, the projected or final cost of the improvement(s),
the number of years of useful life thereof as claimed by the landlord for
purposes of depreciation for federal income tax purposes, the cost of
the improvement, the total number of rooms contained for all housing
space for which such rental increase is sought, the total number of
rooms occupied by the tenant(s) and the monthly surcharge the
landlord is seeking from the tenant.
C. Such expenditures may include the fair market value of materials and
services that are furnished by or without charge to the landlord. The
landlord shall propose to apportion the annual cost of the completed
improvement or service per year of useful life among the tenants and
the dwelling in accordance with one (1) of the following methods:
(1) If the capital improvement benefits certain housing spaces only,
then the cost of those improvements shall be surcharged to only
those units.
(2) If the capital improvement benefits all housing spaces but in
varying degrees according to the amount of rooms in each
individual housing space, then the cost of the improvement shall be
charged according to the number of rooms in each individual
dwelling unit in proportion to the total rentable rooms in the
building or buildings.
(3) If the capital improvement is equally beneficial to all housing
spaces regardless of the living area within any housing space, then
§ 166-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 166-10
1:783
the cost of the improvement shall be distributed equally among all
dwelling units.
D. No application for preliminary or final approval shall be accepted for
processing by the Office of Rent Leveling until the required fee has
been paid and the landlord obtains a certificate of substantial
compliance and provides the same as an attachment to its application.
In the event that the landlord's application is to remedy a violation
which has prevented the landlord from obtaining a certificate of
substantial compliance, then the Hearing Officer, within his or her
discretion, may proceed to either preliminary or final approval, as the
case may be, and set forth in his or her decision that any expenditure of
funds in accordance with the application shall be expended primarily to
remedy and correct violations of the Housing Code of the City of
Orange Township. A decision allowing a conditional surcharge based
upon the utilization of funds to remedy an outstanding violation may, if
violated, subject the landlord to a rebate of surcharges collected and to
forfeit future surcharges during the remaining useful life of the
improvement or increased or improved service.
E. Total surcharges shall not exceed at any one time five percent (5%) of
the tenant's monthly rent in effect at the time of approval of the
surcharge. Annual capital improvement or other surcharges shall be
payable monthly in equal installments, commencing the first day of the
second month following approval of the application or upon completion
of the improvement or increased service, whichever event occurs last.
In the case of a surcharge imposed at the expiration of a lease term or
at the termination of a periodic tenancy, it shall be imposed on the date
the new tenancy begins, provided that the landlord shall give notice to
all affected tenants as to the amount of surcharge and the period for
which the surcharge shall be applied. This notice shall be given at least
thirty (30) days prior to the date in which the landlord seeks to collect
the surcharge. All surcharges granted shall be cumulative with all other
surcharges. The monthly surcharge paid by the tenant shall be onetwelfth
(1/12) of the tenant's surcharge. Payment shall be made during
the useful life of the capital improvement or nonmaintenance
replacement improvement mandated by state statute, regulation or
ordinance (not to exceed the total cost thereof) or for the period during
which the landlord shall continue to furnish the increased service.
F. An application for a surcharge shall be filed within and not later than
one (1) year after the capital improvement or replacement
improvements to property are completed or not later than one (1) year
after the commencement of providing increased or improved services.
G. The decision of the Hearing Officer, either preliminary or final approval,
shall be in writing and shall set forth the name and address of the
applicant, the address of the housing space or dwelling unit which is the
subject of the hearing, the names and addresses of the parties to the
hearing and of all witnesses and of all parties who testified at the
hearing, a finding of fact and a conclusion based thereon. The
§ 166-10 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 166-10
1:784
§ 166-11. Exemptions for new or substantially rehabilitated
dwelling and housing space.
determination shall incorporate all pertinent and relevant evidence
and the basis of an extent to which the Hearing Officer determines
the application meets the standards and guidelines of a capital
improvement or that services have been increased and/or improved.
A. The rent charged or increased with respect to new and substantially
rehabilitated dwellings or housing space shall be exempt from the
provisions of this chapter upon the following conditions, except as set
forth below.
B. Despite any exemption for any housing space or dwelling unit pursuant
to this section, landlords, prior to notifying a tenant of an increase in
rent, shall certify that the dwelling and housing space is in substantial
compliance pursuant to the Code of the City of Orange Township,
§ 156-1 et seq.
C. A landlord or managing agent offering rental for the first time and
thereafter to any subsequent tenant of a newly constructed dwelling or
housing space or a substantially rehabilitated dwelling unit shall advise
and inform prospective tenants, either in its lease application, lease or
in other written form pursuant to the section set forth above, that the
housing space or dwelling unit is in substantial compliance and that the
initial rent shall not be restricted and that any subsequent rental
increases thereafter shall be subject to the Rent Control Ordinance of
the City of Orange Township, § 166-1 et seq., and that verification of the
rental status may be obtained by contacting the Office of Rent Leveling
of the City of Orange Township.
D. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 166-17 (Recording and registering
rents), any building or units subject to this section shall be required to
comply with the requirements of filing a rent roll and shall be subject to
the payment of the registration fees set forth in this chapter and
Chapter 88 of the Code of the City of Orange Township. No rental
increase shall be demanded, received or accepted by the landlord
unless it has complied fully with the provisions of § 166-17 (Recording
and registering rents), and failure to comply will preclude the landlord
from obtaining any increase from a tenant until such time as the current
rents are registered and filed with the Office of Rent Leveling.
E. Rents established for substantially rehabilitated dwellings which are
occupied or housing space or units which the units or individual
housing space has been determined to be uninhabitable for reasons
such as but not limited to substantial destruction, damage, vandalism,
Fire or Housing Code violations affecting the health, welfare, safety and
sanitary conditions for which extensive, material and permanent
renovation and repairs are required may be exempt from the limitation
of the annual rent increase (§ 166-8) by the Hearing Officer or as
otherwise by the Rent Leveling Board for a period of one (1) year.
§ 166-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 166-11
1:785
F. Upon the completion of any new construction or substantial
rehabilitation to any unoccupied multifamily buildings or particular or
specific housing space or units thereafter rented for the first time shall
be exempt from the limitations of the annual rent increase (§ 166-8) for
a period of three (3) years.
G. Any newly constructed addition to a preexisting dwelling which is
rented for the first time shall be exempt from the provisions of the
limitation of the annual rent increase (§ 166-8) for a period of three (3)
years.
H. The landlord or owner of housing space or a building which seeks to
substantially renovate and rehabilitate the unit or building shall apply
to the Office of Rent Leveling for an exemption under this section.
Applications must be filed with that Office, and the Division of Licensing
and Inspections and/ or the Housing Division shall inspect the dwelling
or housing space for which the application pertains. No application
shall be processed unless accompanied by the appropriate fee as
contained in Chapter 88.
I. Upon the filing of an application, the landlord shall submit a plan of
rehabilitation, including a description of the project, housing units
involved, projected or anticipated costs and supportive data, such as
appraisals or estimates and the projected completion schedule and
apartment numbers and names of tenants and family members who will
be affected by any relocation during the renovation period. The
application shall be filed with the Office of Rent Leveling and forwarded
to the Hearing Officer, who shall conduct a preliminary review hearing
as to whether and to what extent and benefit the proposed project falls
within the purview of this section. Preliminary approval may be granted
by the Hearing Officer, whose decision may be conditioned upon the
receipt of further information or documentation. Such decision and
approval, however, shall be contingent upon final hearing and upon
completion of the projected rehabilitation and renovation. Any landlord
seeking a substantial rehabilitation exemption shall file the application,
either preliminary or final, with the Office of Rent Leveling on such
forms as shall be prepared by the Office of Rent Leveling consistent
with the subsections set forth herein, or any additional information as
may be required by the Rent Leveling Board.
J. Prior to the date of hearing, the landlord or managing agent shall serve,
within ten (10) days of the hearing, by certified mail or personal
delivery, upon those tenants who reside in the dwelling and who resided
in the affected housing unit, a notice of the petition, setting forth the
basis for the same and attaching a copy of the application. In the event
that a tenant cannot be located or his or her address is unknown, the
landlord shall certify, in writing, that efforts have been made to
determine the whereabouts of the tenant.
K. With reference to the requirements as set forth in Subsection J above,
the definition of a tenant who resided in the affected unit is one who has
§ 166-11 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 166-11
1:786
temporarily relocated within or without the dwelling or occupied unit
next preceding the commencement of rehabilitation, reconstruction
and renovation of the dwelling and housing unit which is the subject
matter of the exemption application.
L. Permits, as required by law are to be secured from all agencies for
improvements and alterations, and the work must adhere to
appropriate code standards and must be inspected and approved by all
agencies having control and jurisdiction to issue licenses and permits. A
certificate of habitability or a certificate of occupancy must be obtained
as required by law.
M. The landlord, upon approval of its application after final hearing, shall
be obligated upon the rerenting or commencement of a new tenancy of
the affected unit or building to register the rents with the Office of Rent
Leveling and shall be obligated to comply with all terms and conditions
of § 166-16 (Recording and registering rents) during the exemption
period and thereafter.
N. Any tenant temporarily relocated or displaced as a result of the landlord
rehabilitating, repairing or renovating a specific housing unit shall be
given the right of first refusal to enter into or continue its occupancy at
a rental charge established by the Hearing Officer. The landlord shall
certify in writing, either affidavit form or by certification, that is has
notified the tenant of the new rental charge and his right to exercise
first preference in occupying the affected housing unit.
O. Landlords or applicants are required to comply with those provisions of
the Anti-Eviction Law, N.J.S.A. 2A:18-61.1 et seq., in situations which
require the landlord's removal of a tenant in order to comply with local
or state inspections which have cited the landlord for substantial
violations affecting the health and safety of occupants; and without
such removal, it is unfeasible to comply with the rehabilitation and
renovation of the dwelling or housing space. The applicant shall,
pursuant to this chapter and in accordance with law, provide in its
application or at the time of hearing the notice that is required pursuant
to regulations of the Department of Community Affairs, including,
without limitation, N.J.A.C. 5:11-7.1 et seq. In those situations where
substantial rehabilitation undertaken by the landlord realizes the
relocation of a tenant, the landlord shall comply with and provide
evidence at or prior to the hearing of the pertinent provisions of N.J.S.A.
52:31B-1.
P. A determination made by the Hearing Officer or Rent Leveling Board,
as the case may be, approving an exemption from the limitation of the
annual rent increase shall thereafter become known as the revised base
rent for such dwelling or housing space or unit, and all rent increases
subsequent to the exemption period shall again be subject in all
respects to the provisions of § 166-1 et seq.
§ 166-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 166-11

Q. In those cases where the dollar amount expended does not meet the
criteria as set forth in the formula provision for substantial
rehabilitation (see § 166-1), the applicant will not be precluded from
filing an application and having the matter determined at a preliminary
hearing by the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer may recommend
preliminary approval subject to a final review. The basis for any
determination by the Hearing Officer in which the applicant seeks an
exception from the criteria shall take into consideration but shall not be
limited to the following:
(1) The age of the building.
(2) Reasons for the repair, renovation and rehabilitation of the affected
unit or building.
(3) The size or square footage of the units to be affected for which the
applicant seeks an exemption.
(4) The extent to which the nature of the rehabilitation upgrades the
habitability of the unit or building.
(5) The level of rent(s) charged or collected for the units(s) as of the
date of the application.
(6) The market value rent charged for similar units or housing space in
an unrestricted rental market.
(7) Expenses incurred or to be incurred, including therein evidence of
bills, invoices, vouchers, canceled checks and contracts evidencing
proof of labor, material or services rendered in the rehabilitation
and renovation of the affected unit, housing space or dwelling.
(8) The degree to which the anticipated or completed renovation,
repair and rehabilitation benefits the living accommodations of
those occupants residing in the unit or building and the nature and
degree of enhancement and availability of housing stock within the
City of Orange Township.
R. Notwithstanding the provisions as set forth above, the applicant shall
be denied an exemption from the limitations of the percentage increase
if it shall be determined by the Hearing Officer that a tenant who
occupied a unit immediately prior to the landlord's application or
subsequent to preliminary approval shall have vacated the apartment
due to harassment, duress or unreasonable pressures from the
landlord, its agents or representatives. In these circumstances, the
landlord shall file a certificate provided by the Office of Rent Leveling
indicating the name of the vacating tenant, the existing rental and the
circumstances under which the tenant vacated the particular unit. The
landlord shall not be denied an exemption solely under those
circumstances in which the tenant vacates the apartment voluntarily
and there is no unreasonable pressure from the landlord or its agents,
or where the tenant vacates the apartment as a result of a court order

Ord. No. 43-2018]
Housing developments owned or subsidized by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, as well as unsubsidized developments
with HUD-insured mortgages, shall be exempt from the requirements of this
chapter.
§ 166-12. Filing of complaints.
Any complaint of an illegal increase or claim to lower rentals must be
filed with the Office of Rent Leveling no later than six (6) weeks after
the effective date of the disputed increase. For good cause shown and as
otherwise set forth in § 166-8E, the Rent Leveling Board may waive the time

from a court of competent jurisdiction. This ground shall not be
available to a landlord who receives a court order to dispossess a tenant
based upon the tenant holding over and continuing in possession of the
unit after the expiration of its lease term. Circumstances concerning
the vacating of a unit by a tenant and issues raised either by the tenant,
the applicant or the Hearing Officer shall be reviewable at the time of
the hearing. In the event that any factors become known to the Office
of Rent Leveling which are contrary to the applicant's certification as
to the reasons and circumstances surrounding the vacating of a unit or
housing space, the Hearing Officer may, upon application by the Office
of Rent Leveling, the tenant or interested party, seek to rescind the
exemption, in which event the rent shall revert to that rental on the unit
or housing space prior to approval of the exemption, and prosecute the
landlord for violation of this chapter.
S. Landlords of units, housing space or buildings which are being or have
been renovated and rehabilitated within six (6) months prior to the
effective date of this chapter, and which, as of said date, remain
unoccupied, shall not be precluded from filing an application for either
preliminary or final approval from exemption of the limitation of the
annual increase(s) and shall, where applicable, be governed by the
provisions of this section.
A. Rent reductions. Rents charged by the landlord may be rolled back for
any one (1) of the following reasons, if so found by the Rent Leveling
Board:
(1) Decrease in housing space, service, furnishings or equipment.
(2) Deterioration of housing space other than normal wear and tear.
(3) Failure to perform ordinary repairs, replacements and
maintenance.
B. Any claim for rent reduction for the items enumerated above shall take
into account where there has been a diminution or decrease that

Applications to the Office of Rent Leveling for any form of rental increase,
such as but not limited to hardship, capital improvement or surcharges,
substantial rehabilitation of a dwelling or housing space or any other
increase pursuant to a previous resolution, order or the provisions of this
chapter, shall be in the form of an affidavit or certification, as provided by
the Rules of Court, which the applicant or its authorized agent shall attest to
the truth of all information submitted in support of the application. Any false
information contained in the application or any false data submitted to the
Office of Rent Leveling shall be a violation of this chapter, and the applicant
and/or its agent may be subject to the penalties provided for in this chapter.
Any false information, misrepresentation or incorrect information contained
in the application or submitted to the Office of Rent Leveling, the Rent
Leveling Board or a Hearing Officer may result in a denial of the landlord's
application for rental increase or exemption.
§ 166-14. Rent increases; standards for review.
The Office of the Rent Leveling or members of the Rent Leveling Board and
Hearing Officer, in reviewing applications for rent increases, shall be guided
by but not limited solely to the following guidelines:
substantially affects the habitability of the housing unit and common
areas of the building. The Rent Leveling Board shall consider during
its hearing and for the purpose of its decision the duration of the
diminution, decrease or interruption of services; the inconvenience of
any interrupted services; the time period and manner in which the
tenant or tenants gave notice to the landlord or its agent to remedy
or restore the matter(s) set forth in the complaint; and the nature
and extent of action taken by the landlord or its agent in response to
these complaints and the overall effect that the diminution, decrease,
interruption or lack of repairs has had upon the general tenant
population of the dwelling. The Rent Leveling Board shall consider
whether any of the complaints are minor and inconsequential as they
affect the habitability of the tenant or tenants residing in the dwelling,
as well as the multidwelling standards promulgated by the
Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs,
Division of Housing. The Rent Leveling Board shall take into
consideration whether any of the repairs or deterioration is attributable
to the negligence, omission or acts of the tenant or tenants.
C. Any complaints initiated by a tenant or tenants shall relate to a
condition not in excess of three (3) months prior to the filing of a
complaint with the Office of Rent Leveling. A rent rollback may be both
retroactive, but for no longer than a period of three (3) months, and
prospective until such time as the conditions which gave rise to the
complaint are remedied or restored.
§ 166-12 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 166-14
1:790
A. An application for a rent increase shall include the amount of the total
rents which could be derived for the building if the building were fully
occupied. There may be deducted from this total rental figure the
amount of the rental allocated to actual vacancies in the building;
provided, however, that said vacancy deduction cannot exceed four
percent (4%) of the total rentals which could be derived from the
building if fully occupied. Included in such total rentals shall be the
amount of the rental allocated to any apartment occupied by the
landlord or its agent or superintendent on the premises.
B. In the event that any vacancies in the building are deliberately caused
by the landlord or if the landlord does not intend to rent the apartment
and desires to keep that apartment vacant, then in such cases the
amount of the rental of such vacancy shall not be deducted from the
gross rentals.
C. Actual taxes to be paid shall be considered as a tax expense. However,
there shall be deducted from the actual taxes any rebate which the
landlord has or shall receive or any refund received or which shall be
received as a result of a tax appeal.
D. The actual amount of the water and sewage bills shall be considered if
the same can be ascertained: however, any rebate or adjustment of such
charges shall be deducted from said amount.
E. The amount of the expense for insurance shall include the actual
amount paid for the year.
F. The expense for fuel shall be computed by multiplying the actual
amount consumed for the last twelve (12) months prior to the date of
application by the actual price per unit of fuel at the date of filing the
application for the rent increase or at the date of the hearing,
whichever is the greater. However, the reviewing authority shall take
into consideration present market trends and the estimate of future
fuel/gas expense.
G. In the event that the landlord resides in the building and actually
performs the services of superintendent or janitor, a reasonable amount
shall be credited to the landlord as salary for such services. In the event
that the landlord does not perform such services or does not perform all
the services required for a particular building or if said services
encompass more than one (1) residential building, then the amount of
salary shall be adjusted accordingly and credit be given only for such
services actually performed for the building or housing unit for which
an increase is sought.
H. In the event that the landlord does not employ someone to manage the
building but actually manages the building himself, such landlord may
be given credit for a management fee not to exceed four percent (4%) of
the gross rentals actually derived for the building. However, this
percentage may be increased or decreased based upon information
supplied by any of the parties to the hearing reflecting charges for

1:791
§ 166-15. Hardship rent increases; fees.
present market value of management services within the City of Orange
Township.
I. Any expense shall be substantiated with bills and other documentation
sufficient to prove the authenticity and the correctness of the billing,
invoice or voucher. Such proof may be established by canceled checks
and paid bills. The landlord or its agent may be required to provide the
Hearing Officer and/or Rent Leveling Board, as the case may be, with
the last two (2) years' federal income tax return or corporate tax return
or an income/expense or loss statement prepared and certified by a
public accountant of the State of New Jersey.
J. At the time of the hearing, the applicant shall have the right to produce
evidence to show reasons for bills that are owed. That evidence can be
accepted and used to evaluate the application and received as an
amendment to those facts as stated in the application.
A. In the event that the landlord cannot meet its mortgage payments,
operating expenses or does not make a fair return on his property, an
appeal may be taken to the Office of Rent Leveling for increased
rentals.
(1) Notice procedure. Prior to the date fixed for a hearing under this
section and subsequent to the filing of an application with the
Office of Rent Leveling, the landlord shall serve upon each tenant,
by registered or certified mail or personal service, a notice of its
intent to seek a hardship increase and set forth therein the basis for
the increase, the amount of rental increase applied for with respect
to the tenants and the calculation per unit involved. The landlord
shall further post in a lobby of each affected building or, if no lobby,
in a conspicuous place in or about the building or structure a copy
of the hardship application on the forms prescribed by the Office of
Rent Leveling. The application must be posted for at least ten (10)
consecutive days prior to the proposed hearing date. Notices to the
tenant shall be served at least ten (10) days prior to the proposed
hearing date. The time period shall include Saturdays, Sundays and
holidays. In computing any period of time, the day of the service
upon the tenant shall not be included as the day of the act or event
from which the period of time begins to run. The affected tenant(s)
shall have the right to challenge the basis or facts for the hardship
increase on the hearing date. The Hearing Officer shall have the
right, after notice and hearing, to grant or deny a hardship increase
with regard to the rental restrictions and guidelines set forth in this
chapter.
(2) Fair return on invested capital. The landlord may apply to the
Office of Rent Leveling for an increase upon and to the extent that
its return on invested capital is less than a fair return. For purposes
of this formula, a landlord's invested capital shall be the total of his
§ 166-14 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 166-15
1:792
initial cash investment, or downpayment, and the total amount of
amortization of the mortgage(s) covering the property. Mortgages
on properties other than but in addition to the premises for which
the application is brought shall be allowable on a proportionate
basis to be fixed by the Hearing Officer. The invested capital shall
be reduced by any amounts realized from recasting or refinancing
mortgages in excess of the mortgage being paid off.
(a) For the purposes of this section, a fair return on invested
capital shall be that percentage of invested capital equal to
10% above the maximum passbook demand deposit savings
account interest rate available in the municipality.
(b) In order to establish the calculation to determine the fair
return increase, it shall be based upon deducting the landlord's
annual residential operating expenses, including mortgage
interest and amortization, but excluding depreciation, and
further including reasonable, necessary and valid annual
expenses for supplies, administrative costs, management fees,
heating fuel, electricity, water supplied, waste disposal,
building services, security, law and exterior maintenance,
repairs, painting and decorating, real estate taxes and other
taxes, fees and permits, insurance, payroll and wages, from the
landlord's gross annual residential income, derived directly or
indirectly from the operation of the landlord's property,
including, but not limited to, all residential rents received, all
earnings from commissions, vending machines, laundry
equipment and supplies, deductions from security deposits,
late fees, parking fees, garage and pool fees, key charges,
finder's fees and amounts received from successful real estate
tax appeals, income from rebates and landlord's share of
interest earned on tenants' security deposits and hardship
surcharges.
(c) The deduction from the expenses as set forth above shall then
be divided by the invested capital to arrive at the landlord's
return. Any adjustment under this application shall be in such
amount as is necessary to bring the return of the invested
capital to the level of the fair return as defined above.
(d) In order to determine the actual dollar amount of the hardship
rental increase per dwelling unit, the total dollar amount of the
hardship increase granted is to be divided by the total number
of rooms of the landlord's residential rented units. That figure
is then multiplied by the total number of rooms in each
individual dwelling unit to arrive at the increase per dwelling
unit.
(e) The annual percentage increase as set forth in § 166-8 of this
chapter shall be calculated upon the base rent as established
prior to any allowance of a hardship rental increase.
§ 166-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 166-15
1:793
(3) Standards for review and documentation to be presented. Any
expense for which a landlord seeks credit shall be substantiated
with bills and other documentation sufficient to prove the
authenticity and the correctness of the billing, invoice or voucher.
Such proof may be established by canceled checks and paid bills.
The landlord or its agent is required to provide the Office of Rent
Leveling with the last two years' federal income tax return or
corporate tax return. The time period may be waived by the Office
of Rent Leveling in the event that the applicant (landlord) acquired
the building less than 24 months prior to the application. In no
event may the applicant provide documentation referred to above
for a period less than 12 months, except that, in its discretion, the
Office of Rent Leveling may allow a certified income/expense or
profit/loss statement prepared by a certified public accountant of
the State of New Jersey if the federal income tax return(s) and/or
corporate tax return(s) of the predecessor in title cannot be
obtained. At the time of the hearing, the applicant shall have the
right to produce evidence to show reasons for bills that are owed.
That evidence may be accepted and used to evaluate the
application and received as an amendment to those facts as stated
in the application.
(4) Determination by the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer may
make any of the following determinations pursuant to an
application for a hardship rent increase: approve the amount of
increase as requested, deny the application for the requested
increase, or modify the request by approving an increase more or
less than requested. Any increase granted shall be prospective, and
the effective date shall be determined according to New Jersey
Statutes governing timely notice for rent increases, but in no event
shall the increase be charged or collected, with respect to a tenant
during a term of a lease or a periodic tenant, less than one full
calendar month subsequent to his receipt of notification of the
increase. Once a decision has been rendered and the landlord
notified, it shall have the responsibility and obligation, or that of its
agent, to serve proper notice upon all those tenants affected by the
decision.
(5) The Hearing Officer shall make a determination within 60 days of
the filing of a completed hardship application. Any application that
does not set forth information and documentation which is required
in § 166-14 and any other information set forth in the application
form as prescribed by the Office of Rent Leveling shall be returned
to applicant, and the sixty-day period shall not commence until
after the application has been corrected and resubmitted to the
Office of Rent Leveling. For good cause shown, either the Office of
Rent Leveling or the Hearing Officer may extend the time period
for a hearing on the merits of the application, with or without the
consent of the parties to the hearing, but said time period shall not

§ 166-16. Vacancy decontrol. [Amended 12-3-2019 by Ord. No.
53-2019]
Upon the voluntary, uncoerced vacation of any apartment or housing unit
for which rent increases are controlled by this chapter, the landlord shall
have the right to fix the rent for such vacated apartment or housing unit
as appropriate in accordance with the Housing and Urban Development
Fair Market Rental (HUD FMR) guidelines in effect for the year in which
the increase is to occur. The proposed increase is further subject to the
following provisions:
extend beyond 15 days, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and legal
holidays.
(6) An application for a hardship rental increase must be filed not later
than one year following the year in which the hardship allegedly
exists.
B. Fees. There shall be a fee assessed for the processing of each hardship
application, which shall be nonrefundable, in accordance with Chapter
88, Fees, and such fee shall be paid simultaneously with the filing of the
application.
A. In order for the landlord to qualify for the vacancy decontrol rent
increase, the landlord shall first be required to file, within 30 days, a
written statement with the Office of Rent Leveling, signed by the
vacating tenant, certifying to that Office that the landlord has not in any
way harassed, intimidated or pressured the tenant into vacating the
housing unit and that the vacation of such unit was a voluntary act on
the part of the tenant. For the purpose of this chapter, a vacation caused
or necessitated by substandard, unsafe or unsanitary conditions of the
rental premises shall be deemed a voluntary vacation only if the
referenced conditions were caused by the tenant. In the event
substandard, unsafe or unsanitary conditions are caused by the
landlord, the conditions shall be abated by the landlord, and the tenant
shall be given the opportunity to return to the unit at the rental price
charged to the tenant when the condition(s) were discovered. At that
time, should the tenant not wish to return to the unit, the landlord may
then apply for vacancy decontrol, subject to the additional provisions of
this chapter.
B. Such noncoercion certification shall not be required in order for the
landlord to qualify for a vacancy decontrol increase if:
(1) The tenant has moved from the unit without notice to the landlord;
(2) The unit has been vacated pursuant to a judicially mandated
eviction, unless the court-ordered eviction shall have been the
result of a dispute brought about by changes in the terms of the
lease; or
§ 166-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 166-16
1:795
(3) The tenant has refused to sign such certification and, upon appeal
by the landlord or its agent, the Rent Leveling Board has found that
such refusal was unwarranted and that there was in fact no
coercion of any kind exerted by the landlord, its agent or
representatives upon the vacating tenant.
C. Upon vacation of any apartment or housing unit hereafter, the landlord
shall file a statement with the Office of Rent Leveling, certifying to that
Office:
(1) The apartment and building number of such vacated dwelling unit;
(2) The rent paid by the vacating tenant;
(3) The maximum rent increase mandated by the HUD Fair Market
Rental and the rent the landlord proposes to charge if less than the
HUD Fair Market Rental rate;
(4) A copy of the lease showing the rent agreed to by the new tenant
for the apartment; and
(5) The original letter, signed by the vacating tenant, stating that the
vacation of such apartment was the voluntary act of the vacating
tenant and that such vacation was not the result of harassment or
pressure upon such vacating tenant by the landlord or its agents.
D. A copy of the letter sent by the landlord, its agents or representatives
shall notify a tenant, either in a lease or written notice at the inception
of a lease or notice by mailed or personal service within 30 days from
the passage of this chapter, of the tenant's rights under the decontrol
provisions herein. The aforesaid notice shall reasonably advise the
tenant that if he or she alleges harassment or pressure resulted in his or
her vacation of an apartment or housing unit, he or she should notify
the Office of Rent Leveling, and a hearing will be held on the allegation.
A hearing pursuant to this section shall be held before the Rent
Leveling Board upon at least 10 days' written notice to the tenant and
landlord.
E. The provisions of this section shall only apply to an apartment or
housing unit if the new tenant is a tenant other than one presently
residing in the same apartment or housing unit. The "new" tenant may
not be a family member allowing the previous tenant to reside in the
unit.
F. Upon vacation of any apartment hereafter, the landlord shall file a
statement with the Office of Rent Leveling certifying to that Office:
(1) The apartment and building numbers of such dwelling units;
(2) The rent paid by the vacating tenant;
(3) The maximum rent increase that would be permissible were it not
for the vacancy decontrol provisions of this chapter;
§ 166-16 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 166-16

§ 166-17. Recording and registering rents.
Within 60 days of adoption of this chapter, all owners of property within
the City of Orange Township whose rents are subject to and controlled
by this chapter shall file with the Office of Rent Leveling, on the forms
prescribed by the Office of Rent Leveling, a list of all rental units, including
those occupied by the agent or employee of the landlord, which list shall
contain a sworn affidavit or certification as to the accuracy of the rents
therein listed. The list of rents shall set forth the dwelling unit number
or other form of designation; the number of rooms in each dwelling unit;
whether rented or vacant; the name of the tenants(s) occupying rented
units; whether the tenancy is by a written or oral agreement; and the
anniversary or commencement date (day and month) of the next annual
increase. There shall be a separate listing for any capital improvement or
other surcharge previously or hereinafter granted and the expiration date
of same and the dwelling units covered under such charges. Prior to but no
later than March 1 of each year hereafter, the landlord or its agent shall file
with the Office of Rent Leveling a complete and accurate list of the rents
(4) The number of days such apartment remains vacant;
(5) The rent agreed to by the tenant;
(6) That the vacation of such dwelling unit was the voluntary act of the
vacating tenant and not the result of harassment, intimidation or
pressure by the landlord or its agents; and
(7) That no existing tenant within the dwelling unit is determined to
remain in the vacated housing unit.
The landlord shall annex thereto a current certificate of habitability
and certify that the decontrolled housing unit is in substantial
compliance pursuant to the provisions of § 166-1 et seq. and the
Property Maintenance Code of the City of Orange Township.
G. In the event the Board determines that a landlord is seeking to
decontrol or has decontrolled an apartment or housing unit under
circumstances other than those set forth herein, the Board may:
(1) Rescind the decontrol of the apartment or housing unit, and the
rent shall revert to that rental on said unit prior to vacation of the
unit.
(2) Prosecute the landlord for violation of this chapter consistent with
the penalty provisions of § 166-1 et seq.
H. All of the documents listed in this section must be provided to the Office
of Rent Leveling before the unit can be rented at the higher
"decontrolled" rate. Failure to provide the information before the unit is
rented at the higher "decontrolled" rate is cause for the Rent Leveling
Office to reject the decontrol application in its entirety.

§ 166-19. Fees for the filing of applications and registering of rental
units.
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, fees for the filing of an
application for rent increase and recording and registering of rental units
shall be as set forth in Chapter 88, Fees, and shall be nonrefundable and
paid upon the filing of the application with the Office of Rent Leveling. The
fees shall be added to any increase awarded and shall be equally shared
by the tenants residing at the subject premises or whose units are affected
therein. The fees assessed for the annual rent roll registration form shall
be paid upon the filing of the rent roll registration form. One-half (1/2) of
the yearly registration fee may be chargeable by the landlord to the tenant
either in March of each year or upon the commencement of any new lease
term for a year-to-year tenant or for a periodic tenant whose lease term is
less than one (1) year. The landlord shall not collect nor charge a tenant
unless the rent roll registration form and fee(s) for the particular year in
which the tenant is to be charged have been filed with the Office of Rent
Leveling.
§ 166-20. Time period for determinations and decisions.
A. Complaints based on the failure of a landlord to file a rent roll (§ 166-17,
Recording and registering rents) may not be filed more than twelve (12)
months after the effective date of any rental increase sought to be
charged or collected by the landlord.
B. All rental increases shall be paid by the tenant to the landlord until such
time as the complaint has been adjudicated. If it shall be deemed that
the landlord was not or is not entitled to the rental increase, any
moneys that have been overpaid shall be refunded to the tenant or
credit off of future months rent.
C. Notwithstanding the time period set forth in Subsection A, the Rent
Leveling Board may make a determination establishing the annual
rental increase and fixing the base rent despite a disallowance of any
refund or credit to the tenants who initiated the complaint. The Rent
Leveling Board may, on its own motion, upon notice to all parties,
establish and fix the correct base rent which shall be chargeable to the
tenant and direct the landlord to recertify its rent roll and file the same
with the Office of Rent Leveling.
A. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any complaints or
applications filed by a tenant or landlord, whether directly heard by the
Hearing Officer or the Rent Leveling Board, shall be resolved and
decision rendered within sixty (60) days from the filing of a completed
complaint or application.

§ 166-21. Computations.
In computing rental increases and surcharges provided under this chapter,
all amounts so computed may be rounded off to the nearest dollar in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principals.
§ 166-22. Maintenance of services.
During the term of this chapter, the landlord shall maintain the same
standards of service, maintenance, furniture, furnishings and equipment in
the housing space and dwelling as was provided or was required by law or
lease agreement.
§ 166-23. Tax assessments: rebate.
B. On those occasions where a complaint or application takes the format of
mediation and an attempt by the Office of Rent Leveling or Hearing
Officer to resolve the dispute, the time period set forth above shall not
commence to run until such time as the Office of Rent Leveling or
Hearing Officer determines that no amicable resolution has or may be
achieved.
A. In the case where municipal property taxes are decreased in a given
year due to either a decrease in the property tax rate or a lowering of
the assessed evaluation of the property by the municipality, the tenants
are entitled to a tax rebate equal to the amount of the reduction.
[Amended 8-3-1994 by Ord. No. 28-94]
B. The rebate amount is the difference between the current year's taxes
and the base year. The base year is any year, after 1990, in which
property taxes exceed the amount paid in 1990. This amount is to be
prorated, by unit, based on the percentage of the total annual rent roll
(of all units), divided into the decreased amount. That percentage times
each unit's monthly rent for the number of months that tenant resided
in that unit that year equals the amount of the rebate. Rebates may be a
one-time cash payment or used as a credit towards future months' rent
as determined by the landlord to be completed by December 31 or not
later than July 1 of the following year for notices received after

establishing a restricted parking zone in front of a residence occupied
by a handicapped person or persons, the Public Works Department shall
issue a permit which identifies a specific motor vehicle and the location

D. No handicapped parking space shall be established within three
hundred (300) feet of any other handicapped parking space, except that
where handicapped parking spaces are existing in closer proximity on
the effective date of this section, those spaces may remain until the
permit holder dies or otherwise permanently ceases to reside in that
residence, or until he or she no longer qualifies for a handicapped
parking space under the terms of this section and/or the applicable
state statutes;
E. Each applicant for a restricted parking zone in front of his or her
residence shall certify on a form provided by the Department of Public
Works that he or she has no driveway or garage accessible for use as a
parking space;

her continuing qualifications and need for a handicapped parking
space. Each form shall contain instructions for its completion and
return within 30 days of receipt. It is the applicant's responsibility to
notify the Public Works Department in the event that the designated
handicapped parking space is no longer required. Within 30 days after
the due date for the return of the certifications, the Public Works
Department shall submit a list to the City Council of all handicapped
parking spaces for which certifications were not returned. The City
Council may then act at a subsequent meeting to terminate approval of
those handicapped parking spaces for which certifications were not
received. In addition, after verification by the Public Works
Department, the City Council may act at any time to terminate approval
of those handicapped parking spaces held by recipients that have died
or have moved from the City of Orange. [Amended 11-6-2019 by Ord.
No. 38-2019]
J. Before final adoption of an ordinance establishing a handicapped
parking space, the Department of Public Works shall examine each
proposed handicapped parking space and shall report to the City
Council if there is any public policy reason for denying approval of the
§ 200-18.1 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 200-18.1
1:1002
proposed space, including, but not limited to: (1) parking is otherwise
prohibited in the area; (2) the restricted space will interfere with the
normal flow of traffic; (3) the number and/or nature of commercial
establishments in the area make the restricted space burdensome and
impractical; (4) the existence of other restricted parking spaces in
the vicinity of the proposed space is likely to create an unreasonable
burden on neighboring residents. It shall be the responsibility of the
City Clerk to send on the day following introduction of an ordinance
establishing a handicapped parking space a written notice to the Public
Works Department advising of the date for final adoption of said
ordinance.

ARTICLE XIII
Metered Parking
§ 200-53. Definitions.
The following words and phrases, which are not defined in Subtitle 1 of
Title 39 of the Revised Statutes of New Jersey, shall have the meanings
respectively ascribed to them in this section for purposes of this Article:
PARKING METER — A mechanical device or meter not inconsistent with
this Article placed or erected for the regulation of parking by authority of
this Article. Each "parking meter" installed shall indicate by proper legend
the legal parking time established by the City of Orange Township and,
when operated, shall at all times indicate the balance of legal parking time
and, at the expiration of such period, shall indicate illegal or overtime
parking.
PARKING METER SPACE — Any space within a parking meter zone,
adjacent to a parking meter and which is duly designated for the parking of
a single vehicle by lines painted or otherwise durably marked on the curb
or on the surface of the street or lot adjacent to or adjoining the parking
meters.
PARKING METER ZONE — Any restricted on-street or off-street parking
area upon which parking meters are installed and in operation.
§ 200-54. Designations of parking spaces.
The Director of Public Works is hereby directed and authorized to provide
for the marking off of individual parking spaces in the parking zones
designated and described in § 200-64, said parking spaces to be designated
by lines painted or marked on the curbing or surface of the street or lot. At
each space so marked off, it shall be unlawful to park any vehicle in such a
way that said vehicle shall not be entirely within the limits of the space so
designated.
§ 200-55. Installation of parking meters.
In said parking meter zones, the Director of Public Works shall cause
parking meters to be installed upon the curb, sidewalk or area immediately
adjacent to the parking spaces provided for in § 200-64 of this Article.
No parking meters shall be installed in areas where parking is prohibited
pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 39:4-135. The Director of Public Works
shall be responsible for the regulation, control, operation, maintenance and
use of such parking meters. Each device shall be so set as to display a signal
showing legal parking upon the deposit of the appropriate coin, lawful
money of the United States of America, for the period of time prescribed
in § 200-64. Each device shall be so arranged that upon the expiration of
the lawful time limit it will indicate by a proper, visible signal that the
lawful parking period has expired, and in such case the right of such vehicle
to occupy such space shall cease and the operator, owner, possessor or
manager thereof shall be subject to the penalties hereinafter provided.
§ 200-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 200-56
1:1107
§ 200-56. Operation of parking meters.
Except in a period of emergency determined by an officer of the Fire or
Police Department, or in compliance with the directions of a police officer
or traffic control sign or signal, when any vehicle shall be parked in any
parking space alongside or next to which a parking meter is located, the
operator of such vehicle shall, upon entering the said parking meter space,
immediately deposit or cause to be deposited in said meter such proper
coin of the United States of America as is required for such parking meter
and as is designated by proper directions on the meter, and when required
by the directions on the meter, the operator of such vehicle, after the
deposit of the proper coin, shall also set in operation the timing mechanism
on such meter in accordance with directions properly appearing thereon,
and failure to deposit such proper coin and to set the timing mechanism
in operation when so required shall constitute a violation of this Article.
Upon the deposit of such coin (and the setting of the timing mechanism in
operation when so required), the parking space may be lawfully occupied
by such vehicle during the period of time which has been prescribed for
the part of the street in which said parking space is located, provided that
any person placing a vehicle in a parking meter space adjacent to a meter
which indicates that unused time has been left in the meter by the previous
occupant of the space shall not be required to deposit a coin so long as his
occupancy of said space does not exceed the indicated unused parking time.
If said vehicle shall remain parked in any such parking space beyond the
parking time limit set for such parking space and if the meter shall indicate
such illegal parking, then and in that event such vehicle shall be considered
as parking overtime and beyond the period of legal parking time, and such
parking shall be deemed a violation of this Article.
§ 200-57. Manner of parking.
When a parking meter space is parallel with the adjacent curb or sidewalk,
no person shall park or permit the parking of any vehicle in such parking
space in any other position than with the foremost part of such vehicle
nearest to the parking meter; when a parking meter space is diagonal to
the curb or sidewalk, no person shall park or permit the parking of any
vehicle in such parking space in any other position than with the foremost
part of such vehicle nearest to the parking meter; when a parking meter
shall have been installed at the head of and immediately adjacent to any
parking space on a municipal off-street parking lot, no person shall park or
permit the parking of any vehicle in such parking space in any other position
than with the foremost part of such vehicle nearest to the parking meter;
provided, however, that in municipal off-street parking lots signs shall be
erected indicating that head-on parking only is permitted. In any event, a
vehicle shall be parked within the lines marked on the pavement measuring
such parking space.

§ 203-18. Installation of services; payment of costs; charges. [Added
9-3-74 by Ord. No. 49-74]
A. The Public Works Department will make all repairs and/or
replacements on ordinary service pipes between the mains and the curb
stops, but not on private pipes. In the event that a leak occurs in a
service pipe due to deterioration, age or under any other
circumstances, the City of Orange shall make this repair on threequarter-
inch residential services only, at no cost to the property owner.
This ruling shall not apply to any service connection which develops low
pressure, necessitating the replacement of the service connection from
the main to the curb. The schedule of prices for this type of replacement
is set forth in § 203-18. In the event that a leak occurs in a service pipe
other than the three-quarter-inch diameter residential service which
has been installed for more than ten (10) years, the cost of repairs or
replacements will be borne by the owner of the premises served by the
connection. If a leak develops on a service pipe other than the threequarter-
inch diameter residential service which has been installed by
the Public Works Department within ten (10) years of the date of
installation, the Department will make necessary repairs or
replacement at no expense to the owner.
B. If the application for renewal or repair of a leaking service pipe is not
made by the owner at the office of the Public Works Department within
twenty-four (24) hours of notice to said owner by the Department, the
Department will then proceed with the necessary work, regardless. The
owner shall be charged for all work in conformity with the schedule of
rates set forth in § 203-18. Such charges, if they become delinquent, are
a recognized lien upon the property affected.
C. Permits to repair leaks inside the property line in private pipes will be
issued to licensed plumbers upon application to the Building
Inspections and Code Enforcement Department. For leaks outside the
property line or in private pipes in the roadway, the Public Works
Department may shut off the water, upon reasonable notice to the
consumer, until such time as a licensed plumber has been employed by
the owner to make the necessary repairs.
A. The work of installing ordinary services from distribution main to curb
shall consist of tapping the main, inserting a corporation cock, with
proper couplings, laying copper service pipe from main to curb,
providing a stopcock with suitable stop box and cover and replacing
roadway pavement disturbed in making the installation. The work shall
be done by the Public Works Department or under the supervision of
the Public Works Department, and the charges as provided in Chapter
88, Fees, shall be made for service connections in the following
classifications: [Amended 5-18-1982 by Ord. No. 16-82]
(1) For each three-quarter-inch diameter connection.
(2) For each one-inch diameter connection.

(5) For each four-inch diameter connection.
(6) For each six-inch diameter connection.

B. The aforementioned charges shall be paid for by the owner or owners
requesting any of the said installations, at the time of filing an
application for said service and before any work is undertaken by the
City of Orange Public Works Department.
A. Policy Adopted. The City of Orange Township Water and Sewer Billing
Policy is hereby adopted.
B. Purpose. The purpose of the City of Orange Township Water and Sewer
Billing Policy is to provide guidelines and intentions of the City's
operation for Water and Sewer services.
C. Water and Sewer System Billing Policy Enumerated.
WATER AND SEWER BILLING POLICY
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all customers are informed
about the City's billing procedures for water and sewer services
delivered by the City of Orange Township through its agents and/or
service provider.
The provisions herein are policy/procedures only and constitute
guidelines which do not create any requirements or standards which,
upon non-compliance, will give rise to any claim, cause or action, or
basis for non-payment for services rendered. The failure of the city to
comply strictly with any of these policy procedures and guidelines is
not a waiver or relinquishment of any of the rights of the city to seek
payment for water and sewer services rendered nor does such failure
create any defense to the obligation of the user to pay for water and
sewer services rendered.
WATER BILLING: The City or its agents shall read water meters and
send a bill to customers four times per year. For water billing purposes,
billing is divided into three cycles. Bills are issued in billing cycles
based upon your address. For example:
• Cycle 4 — is read and billed in January, April, July and October.
• Cycle 2 — is read and billed in February, May, August and November.
• Cycle 3 — is read and billed in March, June, September and
December.
§ 203-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-18.1
1:1139
To determine your billing cycle, please contact Customer Service at
1-866-893-0546.
All water and sewer accounts will be established in the name of the
property owner where service is rendered. Bills are mailed in the name
of the property owner to the property address. The City will, however,
upon written request by the property owner, mail bills to the property
owner to such other address as designated by the property owner and
will also mail bills to a designated property management company.
BILLING INQUIRIES AND PAYMENTS: Customer Service
Representatives are available at 1-866-893-0546 to answer questions

thereof the municipality shall have entered into a contract to purchase
or institute condemnation proceedings according to law for the fee or a
lesser interest in the land comprising such streets, ways, basins or
areas, the developer shall not be bound by such reservations shown on

of reservation, provided that determination of such fair market value
shall include, but not be limited to, consideration of the real property
taxes apportioned to the land reserved and prorated for the period of
reservation. The developer shall be compensated for the reasonable
increased cost of legal, engineering or other professional services
incurred in connection with obtaining subdivision approval or site plan

variance to allow departure from regulations pursuant to this
chapter, provided, however, that no variance from those departures
enumerated in paragraph D below shall be granted under this
subsection and provided, further, that the proposed development

(1) The Planning Board and/or Zoning Board of Adjustment shall
require escrow deposits for technical and/or professional services
and testimony employed by the Board in reviewing an application,
including the review services of the City Engineer, and Planner and
such other experts as may be deemed necessary (i.e. Traffic,

§ 210-11.8 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 210-11.9
1:1208
(a) Applicants required to submit escrow deposits: exemptions.
[1] Applications involving one (1) single family dwelling on a
single lot, a subdivision not involving the creation of
additional lots, or a site plan not involving a change in use,
shall be exempt from the payment of escrow deposits upon
review by the Administrative Officer or Board Secretary.
This exemption shall be void and escrow fees shall be paid
in the event that it is necessary to hold more than two (2)
hearings on the application or if the application is for the
same block and lots as a prior application made to either
board within the prior two (2) years.
[2] When the Administrative Officer or Board Secretary
determines that the application will serve a public purpose
and promote the public health, safety and welfare, the
following applicants shall submit fifty percent (50%) of the
required escrow deposit.
[a] Public organizations and/or agencies.
[b] Charitable and/or philanthropic organizations.

hearing until the required escrow deposit is paid.
[2] Required escrow deposits shall be in the form of a money
order or certified check payable to the City of Orange
Township.
(c) Escrow for informal review.
[1] Whenever an applicant requests an application for
development, involving technical or professional advisors,
an escrow deposit shall be required in accordance with the
schedule for formal applications. The deposit must be
received prior to professional review.
[2] Any escrow deposit received for informal review shall be
credited to the required escrow deposit for formal
applications. The cost for professional services involved in
§ 210-11.9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-11.9
1:1209
the informal review shall be considered part of the formal
application review and charged to the escrow account.
(d) Resubmissions.
[1] Applicants shall pay escrow fees based upon twenty-five
(25%) percent of the original submission of plans for each
resubmission of revised plans. If plans are resubmitted in
accordance with conditions of approval by the appropriate
Board, the fee for resubmission shall be one-quarter (1/4)
of the original escrow fee.
[2] All applications not specifically noted or excluded above
shall be accompanied by an escrow fee of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.). The escrow fee schedule is intended to
cover the estimated costs for professional services related
to the application. In the event that the balance in any
escrow account falls to a point where it is expected that it
will be insufficient to cover anticipated costs, the applicant
will be required to provide additional funds. Failure to
provide these funds may be used as a basis to discontinue
further action on the application.
(e) Review of escrow deposit amount.
[1] Prior to making a determination of completeness upon any
applicant, the Administrative Officer and/or Board
Secretary will review said application to determine
whether the escrow amount set forth above is sufficient. If
the amount set forth is determined insufficient by the
Administrative Officer and/or Board Secretary to cover
professional costs anticipated for the applicant, additional
funds in the amount of one-third (1/3) of the initially
required escrow fee shall be deposited by the applicant
prior to declaring the application complete. The
application shall not be declared complete or placed on the
agenda for public hearing until such additional escrow
deposit is received.
[2] Further additional escrow deposit fees may be required at
any time upon determination by the Administrative Officer
and/or the Board Secretary. All approvals shall be
conditional upon receipt of such additional fees deposited
by the applicant in increments of one-third (1/3) of the
initially required escrow fee, when and as determined
necessary by the Administrative Officer and/or Board
Secretary, and no building permits or certificates of
occupancy shall be issued until all required escrow funds
have been received.
(f) Appeal of escrow deposit.

to be unreasonable, the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment shall hear and decide whether such fees are
reasonable and the applicant may appeal the decision of
the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment to the
governing body, provided the applicant shall provide the
governing body such transcripts of the Planning Board or
Zoning Board of Adjustment hearings on fees, at his cost,
and such hearing shall be on record. The governing body
shall set a hearing date, with notice to all parties, and the
applicant shall provide a court certified stenographer to
record said hearing. The governing body may reverse a
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment decision

conditions.
[1] Whenever an amount of money in excess of five thousand
dollars ($5,000) shall be deposited by an applicant with the
municipality for professional services employed by the
municipality to review applications the money until repaid
or applied to the purposes for which it is deposited
including the applicant's portion of the interest earned
thereon, except as otherwise provided for here, shall
continue to be property of the applicant and shall be held
in trust by the municipality. Money deposited shall be held
in escrow. The municipality shall deposit it in a banking
institution or savings and loan association in this state
insured by an agency of the federal government, or in any
other funds or depository approved for such deposits by
the state, in an account bearing interest at the minimum
rate currently paid by the institution or depository time or
savings deposits. The municipality shall notify the
applicant in writing of the name and address of the
institution or depository in which the deposit is made and
the amount of the deposit. The municipality shall not
refund an amount of interest paid on a deposit, which does
not exceed one hundred dollars ($100) for the year. If the
amount of the interest exceeds one hundred dollars
($100), that entire amount shall belong to the applicant
and shall be refunded to him by the municipality at the
time the deposit is repaid or applied to the purpose for
which it was deposited, as the case may be, except that the
municipality will retain for administrative expenses a sum
equivalent to no more than thirty-three and one-third
percent (33 1/3%) of that entire amount which shall be in
lieu of all other administrative and custodial expenses.

(h) Accounting of escrow deposits.
[1] In the event any applicant desires an accounting of the
expenses or fees paid by him for professional review, he
shall request such in a letter directed to the Secretary of
the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment. The
applicant shall be responsible for any costs incurred by the
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment in having
its professional and administrative staff prepare an
accounting of the fees expended. Such additional amount

Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment prior to
issuance of a certificate of occupancy in the event that
there are insufficient escrow funds to pay for said
accounting.

appropriate Board to pay the cost of any technical and/or
professional services incurred by the board for review and/
or testimony in connection with the particular application.

Secretary that said application has been finally
determined.

staff support and overhead for a city professional is provided
for by the municipality, the charge for work on the particular
application for development shall not exceed two hundred
percent (200%) of the sum of such work. [Added 9-7-10 by
Ord. No. 14-2010]

H. All notices hereinabove specified in this section shall be given at least

file an affidavit of proof of service with the Board holding the hearing on

I. Any notice made by certified mail as hereinabove required shall be

and times at which maps and documents for which approval is sought
are available as required by law.
A. Requirements. As a condition for approval of a subdivision or site plan,
the Planning Board or Board of Adjustment may require the applicant to
pay his pro rata share of the cost of providing reasonable and necessary
street improvements and water, sewerage and drainage facilities and
easements therefor located outside the property limits of the
subdivision or development. These off-tract improvements shall be
restricted to the improvements called for by the circulation and
comprehensive utility service sections of the Master Plan. These
improvements may be either:
(1) All improvements of the types necessary for on-site installation
where the need for the providing of such improvements off tract is,
in whole or in part, made necessary by the proposed application of
the applicant and where the making of such improvements will
confer a benefit upon the applicant's lands which are the subject of
the application; or
(2) Any improvement or facility, the installation of which is required in
the public interest and the public need for which would not arise
but for the improvement of the lands which are the subject of the
§ 210-11.11 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 210-11.13
1:1216
applicant's application and the installation of which would confer
a benefit upon the applicant's lands which are the subject of the
application. In addition to improvements of the type described
herein, improvements required to maintain a safe flow of vehicular
and pedestrian traffic are specifically declared to be necessary in
the public interest.
B. Allocation of costs. The allocation of costs for off-tract improvements as
between the applicant, other property owners and the city or any one
(1) or more of the foregoing shall be determined by the Board hearing
the application, with the assistance of the appropriate city
departments, in accordance with the following:
(1) The total cost of the off-tract improvements, the increase in market
values of the property affected and any other benefits conferred,
the needs created by the application, population and land use
projections for the general area of the applicant's; property and
other areas to be served by the off-tract improvements, the
estimated time of construction of the off-tract improvements and
the condition and periods of usefulness, which periods may be
based upon the criteria of N.J.S.A. 40A:2-22. The following criteria
may also be considered, as well as any other reasonable criteria,
which would aid in said determination.
(2) Street, curb, gutter, sidewalk, shade tree, streetlight, street sign
and traffic light improvements may also be based upon the
anticipated increase of traffic generated by the application. In
determining such traffic increase, the Board may consider traffic
counts, existing and projected traffic patterns, quality of roads and
sidewalks in the area and other factors related to the need created
by the application and the anticipated benefit thereto.
(3) Drainage facilities may also be based upon the demand determined
by the drainage created by or affected by a particular land use and
considering the following:
(a) The percentage relationship between the acreage of the
application and the acreage of the total drainage basin.
(b) The use of a particular site and the amount of area to be
covered by impervious surfaces on the site itself.
(c) The use, condition or status of the remaining area in the
drainage basin.
(4) Water supply and distribution facilities may also be based upon the
added facilities required by the total anticipated water use
requirements of the property of the applicant and other properties
in the general area benefiting therefrom.
(5) New sewerage facilities may be based upon the proportion that the
total anticipated volume of sewerage effluent of the applicant's
§ 210-11.13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-11.13
1:1217
property and other properties connected to the new facility bears
to the existing capacity to lines and other appurtenances leading
to and servicing the application. Consideration may also be given
to the types of effluent and particular problems requiring special
equipment or added costs for treatment, in the event that the
applicant's property shall be permitted to be connected to existing
sewer facilities, the applicant shall pay a charge or be assessed in
accordance with law.
(6) The cost of installation of the required off-tract improvements shall
be determined by the City Engineer. The Board, with assistance of
appropriate city departments, shall determine the apportionment
of costs for the required off-tract improvements as between the
applicant, other property owners and the city, or more of the
foregoing.
(7) Payment procedure for costs of off-tract improvements required by
the Board.
(a) The applicant shall install and pay for any off-tract
improvements required by the Board if the final determination
of the amount of cost of the off-tract improvements, to be paid
by those other than the applicant, totals less than fifty percent
(50%) of the cost of the off-tract improvements. In the event
that the applicant shall be required to install and pay for the
off-tract improvements as provided, the applicant shall enter
into a contract with the city to provide, for the purposes of this
chapter, that satisfactory proof of the actual cost of installation
of the required off-tract improvements be submitted to the City
Engineer and to provide that the actual cost thereof is no
greater than the amount determined by the City Engineer, with
the exception of contingencies, if any, which may be provided
for in said contract with the city.
(b) The city shall assess all properties, other than the property of
the applicant, benefiting from installation of any off-tract
improvements based upon the actual cost thereof pursuant to
the provisions of the Revised Statutes of New Jersey. However,
principal amounts received by the city from such assessments,
together with interest from property owners who have elected
to pay for said assessments over a period of years, shall, in the
case where the applicant is the installer of the off-tract
improvements, be credited to the real estate account of the
applicant's property. In the case where there has been an
apportionment of cost against the city for the required off-tract
improvements and the applicant is the installer of the off-tract
improvements, then the city shall pay its portion of the cost to
the applicant no more than three (3) months after the
completed installations have been approved by the City
Engineer.
§ 210-11.13 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 210-11.13
1:1218
(c) In the event of any default in payment of an assessment levied
by the city, then the city shall exercise its remedies elsewhere
provided, and if thereafter the balance of principal and interest
due upon the subject assessment has not been fully satisfied by
payment to the city and credit thereof given to the real estate
account of the applicant's property, then the city shall
forthwith pay said balance to the applicant or his then
successor in interest.
(8) In the event that the applicant shall not be required to install the
off-tract improvements, then, in that event there shall be paid to
the City Treasurer the amount of the applicant's share of the finally
determined cost of the off-tract improvements. All moneys received
by the city in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall
be paid to the City Treasurer, who shall provide a suitable
depository therefor, and such funds shall be issued only for the
improvements for which they are deposited or improvements
serving the same purposes, unless such improvements are not
initiated for a period of ten (10) years from the date of payment,
after which time said funds shall be returned to the applicant,
together with accumulated interest or other income, if any.
(a) In the event that the payment by an applicant to the City
Treasurer is less than the applicant's share of the actual cost of
installation of the off-tract improvements required, then the
applicant's property shall be assessed for the difference
between the amount of said payment and the share of the
actual cost.
(b) In the event that the payment by an applicant to the City
Treasurer is more than the applicant's share of the actual cost
of installation of the off-tract improvements required, then
upon such a determination, the City Treasurer shall forthwith
pay to the applicant or his then successor, in interest, an
amount equal to the difference between said payment and the
share of said actual cost.
(9) If the applicant shall be aggrieved by the action of the Board with
respect to determinations made pursuant to this chapter, appeal, in
writing to the governing body, may be taken within thirty (30) days
after the date of the action of the Board.
(10) The Building Inspector and the City Treasurer shall be notified of
the determination of any off-tract improvement requirements or
deposit requirements affecting an applicant's property.
C. Performance guaranties. The applicant shall be required to provide, as
a condition for final approval of his development application, a
performance bond to the city equal to:
(1) If Subsection B(7) of this section applies, the estimated total cost of
the improvements; or
§ 210-11.13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-11.13
1:1219
§ 210-11.14. Decisions.
Each decision on any application for development shall be set forth in
writing as a resolution of the Board, which shall include findings of fact and
legal conclusions based thereon.
(2) If Subsection B(8) of this section applies, the estimated applicant's
share of the cost.
A. A copy of the decision shall be mailed by the Board, within ten (10) days
of the date of decision, to the applicant or, if represented, then, to his
attorney, without separate charge. A copy of the decision shall be also
mailed to all persons who have requested it and who have paid the fee
prescribed by the Board for such service. A copy of the decision shall
also be filed in the office of the City Clerk, who shall make a copy of
such filed decisions available to any interested party upon payment of a
fee calculated in the same manner as those established for copies of
other public documents in the municipality.
B. Failure of a motion to approve an application for development to receive
the number of votes required for approval shall be deemed an action
denying the application.
C. The municipal agency shall provide the findings and conclusions
through a resolution adopted at a meeting held within the time period
provided in the Municipal Land Use Law (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.) for
action by the municipal agency on the application for development or a
memorializing resolution adopted at a meeting held not later than fortyfive
(45) days after the date of the meeting at which the municipal
agency voted to grant or deny approval. Only the members of the
municipal agency who voted for the action taken may vote on the
memorializing resolution, and the vote of a majority of such members
present at the meeting at which the resolution is presented for adoption
shall be sufficient to adopt the resolution. An action pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-9 (resulting from the failure of a motion to approve an
application) shall be memorialized by resolution as provided above,
with those members voting against the motion for approval being the
members eligible to vote on the memorialization of the action of the
municipal agency, however, the date of the adoption of the resolution
shall constitute the date of the decision for purposes of the mailings,
filings and publications required by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-10h and 55D-10i. If
the municipal agency fails to adopt a resolution or memorializing
resolution, as hereinabove specified, any interested party may apply to
the Superior Court in a summary manner for an order compelling the
municipal agency to reduce its findings and conclusions to writing
within a stated time, and the cost of this application, including
attorney's fees, shall be assessed against the municipality.
§ 210-11.13 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 210-11.15
1:1220

arranged by the Secretary of the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be, at reasonable charge to the applicant. Said
notice shall be sent to the official newspaper for publication within ten (10)
days of the date of any such decision.

Pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-39 and 55D-65, every
application for development submitted to the Planning Board or to the
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall be accompanied by proof that no taxes or
assessments for local improvements are due on the property which is the
subject of such application, or, if it is shown that taxes or assessments are
delinquent on said property, any approvals or other relief granted by either
Board shall be conditioned upon either the prompt payment of such taxes or
assessments or the making of adequate provision for the payment thereof in
such manner that the City of Orange Township will be adequately protected.

jurisdiction, such order shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any
Article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause.

J. TVO: Transit Village Overlay. Orange Station is a major physical asset in the
City of Orange Township. To take advantage of its presence, this section establishes
a Transit Village Overlay District, which functions as an overlay to any other
zoning or redevelopment plan covering this geographic area.
The intent of the TVO district is to encourage mixed-use, transit-supportive
development — with a significant residential component within walking distance
of Orange Station. Some of the general characteristics of such development within
the TVO are as follows:
(1) Uses are encouraged to be mixed
within individual blocks, and in some
cases, within individual buildings;
(2) Building height and density should be
higher, closer to Orange Station and/or
in the vicinity of a major development
project;
(3) Parking ratios for business, retail and
commercial use will take into account
that some trips in the TVO are made via
mass transit, pedestrian ways and
bicycle ways; shared parking between
uses is encouraged; surface parking lots
in excess of two acres are prohibited;
(4) Buildings will be set close to the
sidewalk with minimal setback;
(5) Buildings should front on public streets
or public open space; larger buildings
will have articulated facades to make
them more pedestrian-scale in
appearance;
(6) Windows and doors, rather than blank
walls, should face the street level;
parking decks should have active first
floor uses;
(7) Medium- to larger-scale projects
should maintain the street grid network and add new streets to break up large
blocks;
(8) Surface parking areas, individual garages, dumpsters and utility enclosures
should be located behind buildings;
(9) Pedestrian paths to Orange Station are required; mid-block pedestrian

regardless of the allowance for or prohibition of such use in the underlying district.
Similarly, any use listed as not permitted in an overlay district shall be prohibited on
properties within such overlay district, as shown on the Zoning Map, regardless of the

this chapter. Structures or uses nonconforming by reason of height, area or parking
and loading provisions only may be extended, enlarged, altered, remodeled or
modernized, provided that no additional encroachment of height, area or parking
and loading provisions are occasioned thereby, except as hereinafter set forth.
B. Unlawful use not authorized. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as

changed to a use which is not permitted in said more restricted district. The
proposed use shall be subject to all the requirements applying to such proposed use
in the most restricted zone in which the nonconforming use to be changed is
permitted.

destroyed by fire, flood, wind or other calamity may be restored to its size at the
time of such destruction, and the occupancy or use of such building or structure
may be continued or resumed, provided that a permit for such restoration is applied
for within a period of six months of the time of such damage and that necessary
repairs are diligently prosecuted to completion and, further, provided that such
restoration shall be permitted under the Building Code of the City of Orange
Township. The Planning Board may extend such period of time for restoration of
any building or structure when a state or local emergency shall render it impossible
to make the restoration of such building or structure.

nonconforming use of any land or structure shall hereafter be enlarged or extended
or relocated on the same lot, except that accessory parking only may be provided
on the same or an adjoining lot or lots within or without the same zoning districts
on which the nonconforming use exists, subject to the provisions of this section and

A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish zoning conditions and standards
for the placement of the wireless telecommunications towers and antennas while
protecting the public health, safety and general welfare of the residents and property
owners in the City of Orange Township.
(1) Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of
towers and antennas;
(2) Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunication services to the residents
and businesses of the City of Orange Township;
(3) Encourage the location of appropriate wireless facilities upon existing
structures in identified nonresidential areas such as Neighborhood
Commercial, Central Business, General Commercial and Industrial Zones;
(4) Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community by
encouraging alternatives to towers wherever practicable;
(5) Encourage the co-location of antennas on existing towers and other structures
in nonresidential districts as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single-use towers;
(6) Encourage the use of appropriate and new technology so as to minimize
adverse environmental, noise and visual impacts;
(7) Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that
minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through
careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging
techniques;
(8) Preserve the aesthetic character of the city by encouraging creative and
cooperative approaches to locating wireless communication facilities so that
such facilities will be compatible with their surroundings;
(9) Comply with the mandate of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47
§ 210-20.4 § 210-20.5
:IV-27
U.S.C. Section 332(c)(7), which preserves local government authority to
enforce zoning requirements, which protect public safety, public and private
property, and community aesthetics.

under the jurisdiction of the Council or court of competent jurisdiction and have
a COAH-approved spending plan may retain fees collected from non- residential
development.
C. This section establishes standards for the collection, maintenance, and expenditure
of development fees pursuant to COAH's regulations and in accordance P.L.2008,
c.46, Sections 8 and 32-38. Fees collected pursuant to this ordinance shall be used

A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all City of Orange Township zoning districts, residential developers,
except for developers of the types of development specifically exempted
below, shall pay a fee of 1.5% of the equalized assessed value for residential
development provided no increased density is permitted.
(2) When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d(5)
(known as a "d" variance has been permitted, developers may be required to
pay a development fee of 6% of the equalized assessed value for each
additional unit that may be realized. However, if the zoning on a site has
changed during the two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance
application, the base density for the purposes of calculating the bonus
development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right during the twoyear
period preceding the filing of the variance application.
Example: If an approval allows four units to be constructed on a site that was
zoned for two units, the fees could equal 1.5% of the equalized assessed value
on the first two units; and the specified higher percentage up to 6% of the
equalized assessed value for the two additional units, provided zoning on the

to the adoption of a municipal development fee ordinance shall be exempt
from development fees, unless the developer seeks a substantial change in the
approval. Where a site plan approval does not apply, a zoning and/or building
permit shall be synonymous with preliminary or final site plan approval for
this purpose. The fee percentage shall be vested on the date that the building
permit is issued.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing structure
undergoes a change to a more intense use, is demolished and replaced, or is
expanded, if the expansion is not otherwise exempt from the development fee
requirement. The development fee shall be calculated on the increase in the
equalized assessed value of the improved structure.

resulting from alterations, change in use within existing footprint,
reconstruction, renovations and repairs.

nonresidential development fees in accordance with the exemptions required
pursuant to P.L.2008, c.46, as specified in the Form N-RDF "State of New
Jersey Non-Residential Development Certification/Exemption" Form. Any
exemption claimed by a developer shall be substantiated by that developer.
(4) A developer of a nonresidential development exempted from the
nonresidential development fee pursuant to P.L.2008, c.46 shall be subject to

A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural BMPs. Structural BMPs should be
integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and
proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater
recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this development standard to establish
minimum stormwater management requirements and controls for
"major development," as defined in § 210-32.2, Definitions.

subdivisions for the following major developments that require
preliminary or final site plan or subdivision review:
(a) Nonresidential major developments; and
(b) Aspects of residential major developments that are not
preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) This development standard shall also be applicable to all major
developments undertaken by the City of Orange Township.
D. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant
to this development standard are to be considered an integral part of
development approvals under the subdivision and site plan review
process and do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure
required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other
applicable code, rule, act, or ordinance. In their interpretation and
application, the provisions of this development standard shall be held to
be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health,
safety, and general welfare. This development standard is not intended

grate has an area of no more than seven (7.0) square
inches, or is no greater than 0.5 inches across the smallest
dimension.
Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer

§ 210-32.4 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 210-32.4
1:1296
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two (2) or more clear spaces) shall have
an area of no more than seven (7.0) square inches, or be no
greater than two (2.0) inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in § 210-32.4G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end of pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one (1) of the
following:
[a] A rectangular space four and five-eighths (4 5/8)
inches long and one and one-half (1 1/2) inches wide

[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one (1) inch spacing between the bars,
to the elevation of the water quality design storm as
specified in § 210-32.4G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in § 210-32.4F and G
shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a

F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 210-32.5, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain one hundred (100%) percent of the
average annual preconstruction groundwater
recharge volume for the site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to post-construction for the
2-year storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the "urban redevelopment area," or to
projects subject to paragraph [3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied, areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for
§ 210-32.4 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 210-32.4
1:1298
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to "source material."
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 210-32.5, complete one (1)
of the following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, post-construction
runoff hydrographs for the 2-, 10-, and 100-year storm
events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the 2-, 10-, and 100-year
storm events and that the increased volume or change in
timing of stormwater runoff will not increase flood damage
at or downstream of the site. This analysis shall include the
analysis of impacts of existing land uses and projected
land uses assuming full development under existing zoning
and land use ordinances in the drainage area;
§ 210-32.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-32.4
1:1299
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
post-construction peak runoff rates for the 2-, 10-, and
100-year storm events are 50, 75 and 80 percent,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the post-construction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to postconstruction
stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with paragraphs [1], [2] and [3]
above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at § 210-32.2 shall be submitted to
the appropriate Soil Conservation District for review and approval
in accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this
section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in
stormwater runoff by eighty percent (80%) of the anticipated load
from the developed site, expressed as an annual average.
Stormwater management measures shall only be required for
water quality control if an additional one-quarter (1/4) acre of
impervious surface is being proposed on a development site. The
requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to any stormwater runoff
in a discharge regulated under a numeric effluent limitation for
TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination
System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge
specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this requirement.
The water quality design storm is one and one-quarter (1.25)
inches of rainfall in two (2) hours. Water quality calculations shall
take into account the distribution of rain from the water quality
design storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume
of runoff may take into account the implementation of
nonstructural and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual and other sources of technical
guidance may be obtained from the address identified in
§ 210-32.7, or found on the Department's website at
www.njstormwater.org. TSS reduction shall be calculated based on
the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2 below. Alternative
removal rates and methods of calculating removal rates may be
used if the design engineer provides documentation demonstrating
the capability of these alternative rates and methods to the review
agency. A copy of any approved alternative rate or method of
calculating the removal rate shall be provided to the Department at
the following address: Division of Watershed Management, New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, PO Box 418,
Trenton, New Jersey, 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one (1) BMP in series is necessary to achieve the
required eighty percent (80%) TSS reduction for a site, the
applicant shall utilize the following formula to calculate TSS
reduction:
R = A+B - (AxB)/100
Where
§ 210-32.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-32.4
1:1301
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs, and
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP

(4) If there is more than one (1) on-site drainage area, the eighty
percent (80%) TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area,
unless the runoff from the subareas converge on site in which case
the removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using
a weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in § 210-32.4F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-l.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
§ 210-32.4 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 210-32.4
1:1302
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one (1) of the
following:
[1] A 300-foot special water resource protection area shall be
provided on each side of the waterway, measured
perpendicular to the waterway from the top of the bank
outwards or from the centerline of the waterway where the
bank is not defined, consisting of existing vegetation or
vegetation allowed to follow natural succession is
provided.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under paragraph [1] above shall
only be allowed where previous development or
disturbance has occurred (for example, active agricultural
use, parking area or maintained lawn area). The
encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than one hundred fifty (150) feet as
measured perpendicular to the top of bank of the
waterway or centerline of the waterway where the bank is
undefined. All encroachments proposed under this
subparagraph shall be subject to review and approval by

municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to § 210-32.4G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to
§ 210-32.4G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current
functional value and overall condition of the special water
resource protection area as defined in § 210-32.4G(8)(a)[1]
above. In no case shall a stream corridor protection plan allow
the reduction of the Special Water Resource Protection Area to

perpendicular to the waterway subject to this subsection.
(e) Section 210-32.4G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
(1) individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
§ 210-32.4 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 210-32.5
1:1304
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one (1) of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4 — Hydrology and
Technical Release 55 — Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds; or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at § 210-32.5A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at § 210-32.5A(1)(b). A runoff
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five (5) years without
interruption prior to the time of application. If more than one (1)
land cover have existed on the site during the five (5) years
immediately prior to the time of application, the land cover with the
lowest runoff potential shall be used for the computations. In
addition, there is the presumption that the site is in good
hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn, or park),
with good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with good
hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land use
type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55 — Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
§ 210-32.5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-32.5
1:1305
§ 210-32.6. Standards for structural stormwater management
measures. [Added 12-19-06 by Ord. No. 40-2006]
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32 A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual; at
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/; or at New Jersey Geological
Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, P.O. Box 427, Trenton, New Jersey,
08625-0427; (609) 984-6587.
A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one (1) inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of
the water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the
water quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure
shall be spaced no greater than one-third (1/3) the width of the
diameter of the orifice or one-third (1/3) the width of the weir, with
a minimum spacing between bars of one (1) inch and a maximum
spacing between bars of six (6) inches. In addition, the design of
trash racks must comply with the requirements of § 210-32.8B.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosion
resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of two and one-half (2 1/2)
inches in diameter.

(1) Final approval shall be granted or denied within forty-five (45) days
after submission of a complete application or within such further
time as may be consented to by the applicant. Failure of the Board
to act within the period prescribed shall constitute final approval,

conferred upon the developer pursuant to § 210-52, Exceptions,
whether conditionally or otherwise, shall not be changed for a period of
two (2) years after the date of final approval, except that the rights
conferred by this section shall expire if the plat has not been duly
recorded within the time period provided in this chapter. If the

ARTICLE VIII
Miscellaneous Provisions
§ 210-56. Performance and Maintenance Guarantees.
Before the recording of final site plan approval or as a condition to the
issuance of a zoning permit, the approving authority may require
performance and maintenance guarantees for the purpose of assuring the
installation and maintenance of on-tract improvements, more specifically:
A. The furnishing of a performance guaranty in favor of the municipality,
in an amount not to exceed one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the
cost of installation for improvements it may deem necessary or
appropriate, including streets, street signs, grading, pavement, gutters,
curbs, sidewalks, street lighting, shade trees, surveyor's monuments
(as shown on the final map and required by the Map Filing Law, P.L.
1960, c. 141 (N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.) water mains, culverts, storm
sewers, sanitary sewers or other means of sewage disposal, drainage
structures, erosion control and sedimentation control devices, topsoil
protection, public improvements of open space and, in the case of site
plans only, other on-site improvements and landscaping.
B. Provisions for a maintenance guaranty to be posted with the governing
body for a period not to exceed two (2) years after final acceptance of
the improvement, in an amount not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) of
the cost of the improvement. In the event that other governmental
agencies or public utilities automatically will own the utilities to be
installed or that the improvements are covered by a performance or
maintenance guaranty to another governmental agency, no
performance or maintenance guaranty, as the case may be, shall be
required by the municipality for such utilities or improvements.
C. The amount of any performance guaranty may be reduced by the
governing body by resolution when portions of the improvements have
been certified by the Municipal Engineer to have been completed. The
time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the
performance guaranty has been provided may be extended by said body
by resolution.
D. If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guaranty, the obligor and surety, if
any, shall be liable thereon to the municipality for the reasonable cost of
the improvements not completed or corrected, and the municipality
may, either prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof,
complete such improvements.
E. Prior to requesting a municipal engineering inspection of the completed
improvements, the applicant shall first deposit with the municipality an
engineering Inspection Escrow Fee equal to five percent (5%) of the
previously estimated construction cost to cover municipal costs of
improvement inspections. When all the required improvements have
§ 210-56 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-56
1:1347
been completed, the obligor shall notify the governing body, in writing,
by certified mail addressed in care of the Municipal Clerk, of the
completion of said improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the
Municipal Engineer. Thereupon, the Municipal Engineer shall inspect
all of the improvements and shall file a detailed report, in writing,
with the governing body, indicating either approval, partial approval or
rejection of the improvements with a statement of reasons for rejection.
If partial approval is indicated, the cost of the improvements rejected
shall be set forth. Upon full acceptance of all improvements by the
Municipal Engineer, said engineer shall notify the governing body in
writing that all unencumbered Engineering Inspection Escrow funds
may be released to the applicant upon the applicant's written request
to the governing body for such refund.
F. The governing body shall either approve, partially approve or reject the
improvements, on the basis of the report of the Municipal Engineer, and
shall notify the obligor, in writing, by certified mail, of the contents of
said report and the action of said approving authority with relation
thereto not later than sixty-five (65) days after the receipt of the notice
from the obligor of the completion of the improvements. Where partial
approval is granted, the obligor shall be released from all liability
pursuant to its performance guaranty, except for that portion
adequately sufficient to secure provision of the improvements not yet
approved. Failure of the governing body to end or provide such
notification to the obligor within sixty-five (65) days shall be deemed to
constitute approval of the improvements, and the obligor and surety, if
any, shall be released from all liability pursuant to such performance
guaranty.
G. If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the approving
authority may require the obligor to complete such improvements, and,
upon completion, the same procedure of notification as set forth in this
section shall be followed.
H. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the
obligor to contest by legal proceedings any determination of the
governing body or the Municipal Engineer.

developer or tenant shall be subject to one or more of the following

affordable housing units, payment into the City of Orange
Township Affordable Housing Trust Fund of the gross amount
of rent illegally collected;
(c) In the case of an owner who has rented his or her low- or
moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations governing
affordable housing units, payment of an innocent tenant's
reasonable relocation costs, as determined by the court.
(2) The municipality may file a court action in the Superior Court
seeking a judgment, which would result in the termination of the
owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a
mortgage foreclosure. Any judgment shall be enforceable as if the
§ 210-74 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-75
1:1365
same were a judgment of default of the First Purchase Money
Mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the low- and moderateincome
unit.
C. Such judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the municipality,
by means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at which time the low- and
moderate-income unit of the violating owner shall be sold at a sale price
which is not less than the amount necessary to fully satisfy and pay off
any First Purchase Money Mortgage and prior liens and the costs of the
enforcement proceedings incurred by the municipality, including
attorney's fees. The violating owner shall have the right to possession
terminated as well as the title conveyed pursuant to the Sheriffs sale.
D. The proceeds of the Sheriffs sale shall first be applied to satisfy the
First Purchase Money Mortgage lien and any prior liens upon the lowand
moderate-income unit. The excess, if any, shall be applied to
reimburse the municipality for any and all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with either the court action resulting in the judgment of
violation or the Sheriffs sale. In the event that the proceeds from the
Sheriffs sale are insufficient to reimburse the municipality in full as
aforesaid, the violating owner shall be personally responsible for and to
the extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and all costs incurred by
the municipality in connection with collecting such deficiency. In the
event that a surplus remains after satisfying all of the above, such
surplus, if any, shall be placed in escrow by the municipality for the
owner and shall be held in such escrow for a maximum period of two (2)
years or until such earlier time as the owner shall make a claim with the
municipality for such. Failure of the owner to claim such balance within
the two-year period shall automatically result in a forfeiture of such
balance to the municipality. Any interest accrued or earned on such
balance while being held in escrow shall belong to and shall be paid to
the municipality, whether such balance shall be paid to the owner or
forfeited to the municipality.
E. Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the regulations
governing affordable housing units shall not extinguish the restrictions
of the regulations governing affordable housing units as the same apply
to the low- and moderate-income unit. Title shall be conveyed to the
purchaser at the Sheriffs sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions
of the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. The owner
determined to be in violation of the provisions of this plan and from
whom title and possession were taken by means of the Sheriffs sale
shall not be entitled to any right of redemption.
F. If there are no bidders at the Sheriffs sale, or if insufficient amounts are
bid to satisfy the First Purchase Money Mortgage and any prior liens,
the municipality may acquire title to the low- and moderate-income unit
by satisfying the First Purchase Money Mortgage and any prior liens
and crediting the violating owner with an amount equal to the
difference between the First Purchase Money Mortgage and any prior
liens and costs of the enforcement proceedings, including legal fees and

the maximum resale price for which the low- and moderate-income unit
could have been sold under the terms of the regulations governing
affordable housing units. This excess shall be treated in the same
manner as the excess which would have been realized from an actual
sale as previously described.
G. Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold at the
Sheriffs sale or acquired by the municipality shall obligate the owner to
accept an offer to purchase from the low- and moderate-income unit as
permitted by the regulations governing affordable housing units.
H. The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable for
complying with the terms and restrictions of governing affordable
housing units until such time as title is conveyed from the owner.

are encouraged to request an informal "informational meeting" with the
Historic Preservation Commission. Requests for such informational
meetings can be made to the administrative officer. The Commission shall
hold such informational meetings within forty-five (45) days of receipt
of such request. The purpose of an informational meeting is to inform
the persons of the standards of appropriateness and the procedures for
obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness, if such is required.
The Commission may grant a Certificate of Appropriateness at an
informational meeting, if the preliminary data and drawings are sufficiently
explicit, for projects which it deems to be very minor, involving exterior
repairs or alterations to existing buildings, signs, walls or fences.
§ 210-87. Emergency procedures.
When a structure or improvement requires immediate repair to preserve
the continued habitability of the structure and/or the health and safety of its
occupants or others, emergency repairs may be performed in accordance
with City codes, without first obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness.
Under such circumstances, the repairs performed shall be only such as are
necessary to protect the health and safety of the occupants of the structure
or others and/or to maintain the habitability of the structure. A request
for the Commission's review shall be made simultaneously with the onset
of emergency work. Such emergency work shall be permitted only if the
Construction Official certifies to the administrative officer the immediate
necessity for such permit issuance. Upon notice by the administrative
officer to the full Historic Preservation Commission by telephone, personal
contact or other appropriate means of communication, at least three (3)
members of the Commission shall convene as soon as possible and such
convening members shall proceed to review the Certificate of

accounts shall be held in conformity with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.1.
(1) The Commission shall require escrow deposits for technical and/or
professional services and testimony employed by the Commission
in reviewing an application, including the review services of the

deemed necessary (i.e. Traffic, Environmental, Radio Frequency,
Soils, Legal, etc.).
(2) Fees for technical and professional services shall be in addition to
any and all other required fees.
(a) Applicants required to submit escrow deposits: exemptions.
[1] Applications for Certificate of Appropriateness involving
one (1) single family dwelling on a single lot, a subdivision
not involving the creation of additional lots, or a site plan
not involving a change in use, shall be exempt from the
payment of escrow deposits upon review by the
Administrative Officer or Board Secretary. This exemption
shall be void and escrow fees shall be paid in the event
that it is necessary to hold more than two (2) hearings on
the application or if the application is for the same block
and lots as a prior application made to either board within
the prior two (2) years.
[2] When the Commission Secretary determines that the
application will serve a public purpose and promote the
public health, safety and welfare, the following applicants
shall submit fifty percent (50%) of the required escrow
deposit.
[a] Public organizations and/or agencies.
[b] Charitable and/or philanthropic organizations.

hearing until the required escrow deposit is paid.

order or certified check payable to the City of Orange
Township.
(c) Escrow for informal review.
[1] Whenever an applicant requests a Certificate of
appropriateness involving technical or professional
advisors, an escrow deposit shall be required in
accordance with the schedule for formal applications. The
deposit must be received prior to professional review.
[2] Any escrow deposit received for informal review shall be
credited to the required escrow deposit for formal
applications. The cost for professional services involved in
the informal review shall be considered part of the formal
application review and charged to the escrow account.
(d) Resubmissions.
[1] Applicants shall pay escrow fees based upon twenty-five
percent (25%) of the original submission of plans for each
resubmission of revised plans. If plans are resubmitted in

Commission, the fee for resubmission shall be one-quarter
(1/4) of the original escrow fee.
[2] All applications not specifically noted or excluded above
shall be accompanied by an escrow fee of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.). The escrow fee schedule is intended to
cover the estimated costs for professional services related
to the application. In the event that the balance in any
escrow account falls to a point where it is expected that it
will be insufficient to cover anticipated costs, the applicant
will be required to provide additional funds. Failure to
provide these funds may be used as a basis to discontinue
further action on the application.
(e) Review of escrow deposit amount.
[1] Prior to making a determination of completeness upon any
applicant, the Commission Secretary will review said
application to determine whether the escrow amount set

cover professional costs anticipated for the applicant,
additional funds in the amount of one-third (1/3) of the
initially required escrow fee shall be deposited by the
§ 210-94.1 ORANGE TOWNSHIP CODE § 210-94.1

application shall not be declared complete or placed on
the agenda for public hearing until such additional escrow
deposit is received.
[2] Further additional escrow deposit fees may be required at
any time upon determination by the Commission
Secretary. All approvals shall be conditional upon receipt
of such additional fees deposited by the applicant in
increments of one-third (1/3) of the initially required
escrow fee, when and as determined necessary by the
Commission Secretary, and no building permits or
certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all required
escrow funds have been received.
(f) Appeal of escrow deposit.
[1] In the event that the applicant believes the escrow deposit
to be unreasonable, the Historic Preservation Commission
shall hear and decide whether such fees are reasonable
and the applicant may appeal the decision of the Historic

transcripts of the Historic Preservation Commission
hearings on fees, at his cost, and such hearing shall be on
record. The governing body shall set a hearing date, with
notice to all parties, and the applicant shall provide a court

thereon, except as otherwise provided for here, shall
continue to be property of the applicant and shall be held
in trust by the municipality. Money deposited shall be held
in escrow. The municipality shall deposit it in a banking
institution or savings and loan association in this state
insured by an agency of the federal government, or in any
other funds or depository approved for such deposits by
the state, in an account bearing interest at the minimum
rate currently paid by the institution or depository time or

§ 210-94.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-94.1
1:1383
applicant in writing of the name and address of the
institution or depository in which the deposit is made and
the amount of the deposit. The municipality shall not
refund an amount of interest paid on a deposit, which
does not exceed one hundred dollars ($100) for the year.
If the amount of the interest exceeds one hundred dollars
($100), that entire amount shall belong to the applicant
and shall be refunded to him by the municipality at the
time the deposit is repaid or applied to the purpose for
which it was deposited, as the case may be, except that
the municipality will retain for administrative expenses a
sum equivalent to no more than thirty-three and one-third
percent (33 1/3%) of that entire amount which shall be in
lieu of all other administrative and custodial expenses.

expenses or fees paid by him for professional review, he
shall request such in a letter directed to the Secretary of
Historic Preservation Commission. The applicant shall be
responsible for any costs incurred by the Historic
Preservation Commission in having its professional and
administrative staff prepare an accounting of the fees
expended. Such additional amount as may be required for

determined.

[Amended 8-2-2017 by Ord. No. 45-2017]
The purpose of this section is to provide uniform design criteria and
guidelines for the regulation of historic sites and historic districts for use by
the Historic Preservation Commission, the City of Orange Township and the
public.
In addition to designation and regulation of local landmarks, historic sites
and historic districts as set forth in this chapter, all permits or actions
requiring a Certificate of Appropriateness and all applications for
development in historic districts or for historic sites shall be governed by
the Design Guidelines for Historic Districts and Sites as shown on a map
replacement plant material or features shall match the historic

such as adding conjectural features or historic features from other
properties shall be avoided.

historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
J. Distinctive materials, features, finishes and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be
preserved.
K. Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced.
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary
or physical evidence.
L. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.

such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be
undertaken.

positions, attract tourists, students, writers, historians, artists and
artisans, attract new residents, encourage study and interest in
American history, stimulate interest and study in architecture and

§ 210-100. Conflicts with codes.
Although all buildings, sites, places and structures should meet the
appropriate housing and building codes, it is recognized that instances may
arise where certain normal provisions thereof might be in conflict with the
purposes of this Article. In such instances, the provisions of the building
code shall be applicable.
In the event that a structure is unsafe or unsound so as to pose a danger to
health or safety, the power and authority of the City of Orange Township to
demolish the structure, as otherwise provided by law, shall not be impaired
or altered in any way by the provisions of this chapter.
§ 210-101. Purpose of demolition provisions.
The purpose of these procedures regarding demolition is to further the
purposes of this chapter by affording the City, interested persons, historical
societies or organizations the opportunity to acquire or to arrange for the
preservation of historic buildings, sites, places and structures.
§ 210-102. Procedure where demolition disapproved.
In the event that the Commission disapproves an application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness to demolish a historic building, place or
structure, the owner shall, nevertheless, as a matter of right, be entitled to
raze or demolish such building, place or structure provided that all of the
following requirements have been fully met:
G. The structural soundness and integrity of the building and the economic
feasibility of restoring or rehabilitating the structure so as to comply
with the requirements of the State Uniform Code.

and has received notice of denial of same from the Commission and has
appealed to the Zoning Board of Adjustment, which has affirmed such
denial.

the full notice period as defined in § 210-104.

building, place or structure and the land pertaining thereto to any
person, organization, government or agency thereof or political
subdivision which gives reasonable assurance that it is willing to
preserve the building, place or structure and the land pertaining
thereto.
D. The owner shall not have been a party to any bona fide contract,
binding upon all parties thereto, for the sale of any such building, place
or structure and the land pertaining thereto executed prior to the

The period of time during which notice must be given in the manner
herein before set forth shall be known as the "Notice Period" which shall

notice period shall run for a period of time of nine (9) months unless a
shorter period is authorized by the Commission.
§ 210-105. Approval after change of circumstance.
The Commission may at any time during such notice period, if a significant
change in circumstances occurs, approve a Certificate of Appropriateness,
in which event, a permit shall be issued within ten (10) days thereafter.
§ 210-106. Effect of Certificate of Appropriateness.
Issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be deemed to be final
approval pursuant to this Article. Such approval shall neither cause nor
prevent the filing of any collateral application or other proceeding required
by any other municipal ordinance to be made prior to undertaking the
action requested vis-a-vis the site or structure in the historic district.

§ 210-110. Reconsideration of denial of Certificate of
Appropriateness.
The Commission may refuse to reconsider for a period of one (1) year any
disapproval of an application, except in cases where an applicant reapplies,
with his application amended to comply with any recommendations which
the Commission may have made in its written reasons for disapproval. The
Commission may, however, reconsider at any time denial of a Certificate of
Appropriateness for demolition if a significant change in circumstances has
occurred.
§ 210-111. Application to governmental agencies.
It is recognized that the intent and purposes of this Article would not be
fully served if the City were to control the actions of others but fail to apply
similar constraints to itself. Accordingly, a Certificate of Appropriateness
shall be required before final approval of any City actions on public as well
as private lands, streets, easements and rights-of-way. This requirement
shall be deemed to include any action by any party which requires the

the appeal to the administrative officer of the Historic Preservation
Commission simultaneously with filing with the Board of Adjustment by
certified mail, return receipt requested. The appellant shall also be
responsible for notifying the administrative officer of the Historic
Preservation Commission at least ten (10) days in advance of the appeal
hearing.
C. The administrative officer and the Commission shall have a right to
appear before the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The Commission may
convey its position through delegation of one (1) of its members or staff
to testify orally at the hearing on the application and to explain any
written report which may have been submitted.
D. In the event the Zoning Board of Adjustment determines there is an
error in any order, requirement, decision or refusal made by the
administrative officer pursuant to a report submitted by the Historic
Preservation Commission, the Board of Adjustment shall include the
reasons for its determination in the findings of its decision thereon at
the public hearing and in its Resolution of Memorialization.
E. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the right of judicial review of
the municipal action after an appeal is concluded by the municipal
Zoning Board of Adjustment.

approval or concurrence of the City or any City agency and which is not
otherwise covered by the provisions of this chapter.
In those circumstances where the City cannot require compliance, as in
certain cases involving the county, state and federal governments, the City
urges, most strongly, the voluntary cooperation of such agencies in seeking
a Certificate of Appropriateness and hereby authorizes the Commission to
consider such requests and applications.
§ 210-112. Other requirements unaffected.
The requirements of this Article shall be considered to be in addition to and
in no case shall they be interpreted as a substitute for any other approval,
permit or other action as otherwise provided for.
§ 210-113. Violation penalties.
Any person violating any of the provisions of this Article shall, upon
conviction thereof, be subject to the penalties herein.
A. A separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day during or on
which a violation occurs or continues.
B. If any person shall undertake any activity vis-a-vis a historic site or
improvement within a historic district without first having obtained and
posted a Certificate of Appropriateness, such person shall be deemed to
be in violation of this chapter.
C. Upon learning of the violation, the Zoning Officer shall personally serve
upon the owner of the lot whereon the violation is occurring a notice
describing the violation in detail and giving the owner ten (10) days to
abate the violation by restoring the site or improvement to its status
quo ante. If the owner cannot be personally served within the
municipality with the said notice, a copy shall be posted on site and a
copy sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner at
the last known address as it appears on the municipal tax rolls.
D. In the event that the violation is not abated within ten (10) days of
service or posting on site, whichever is earlier, the Zoning Officer shall
cause to be issued a summons and complaint, returnable in the
municipal court, charging violation of this chapter.
E. The penalty for violations shall be as follows:
(1) For each day, up to ten (10) days - not more than twenty-five dollars
($25) per day;

1:1392
§ 210-114. Injunctive relief.
In the event that any action, which would permanently and adversely
change a historic site or historic district, such as demolition or removal
is about to occur without a Certificate of Appropriateness having been
issued, the Zoning Officer is hereby authorized to apply to the Superior
Court of New Jersey for such injunctive relief as is necessary to prevent the
destruction of such site or district.
§ 210-115. Preventive maintenance.
If any person shall undertake any activity vis-a-vis a historic site or
improvement within a historic district without first having obtained
a Certificate of Appropriateness, he shall be required to restore
same.
A. Recognizing the need for preventive maintenance to insure the
continued useful life of historic sites and structures in historic districts,
the Orange City Council hereby declares that code enforcement vis-avis
historic sites and structures in historic districts is a high municipal
priority.
B. All historic sites and all buildings and structures in a historic district
shall be maintained so that all exterior walls, roofs, stairs, porches,
windows and door frames are in a watertight condition. Cornices,
entablatures, wall facings, trim and similar decorative features shall be
maintained so as to prevent deterioration and any deterioration which
adversely affects the overall character of the building or the district in
which the building is located is prohibited.
C. In the event that any landmark or improvement in a historic district
deteriorates to the point that, in the best estimate of the Department of
Planning and Development, the cost of correcting the outstanding code
violations equals more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the cost of
replacing the entire improvement on which the violations occur, the
Department shall serve personally or by certified mail, return receipt
requested, a notice on the owner of the site or structure, listing the
violations, the estimate for their abatement, and the replacement cost
of the improvement and stating that if the owner does not take all
necessary remedial action within ninety (90) days, or such extensions
as the Department shall for good cause grant, the City of Orange's
designated official may, at the expiration of ninety (90) days, enter upon
the property and abate such violations itself and cause the cost thereof
to become a lien on the property.
D. Upon receipt of such notice, the owner may, within ten (10) days after
such receipt, notify the Department of Planning and Development of
his/her wish to have a hearing as to the allegations and estimates set
forth in the Department's notice. Such hearing shall be conducted by
the Commission and shall, so far as possible, be a formal proceeding in
§ 210-113 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-115
1:1393
§ 210-116. Enforcement.
It shall be the duty of all municipal officials of the City of Orange Township
reviewing all permit applications involving real property or improvements
thereon to determine whether such application involves any activity which
should also be the subject of an application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness or subject to review by the Historic Preservation
Commission. If it should, the Officer shall inform both the Secretary of the
Commission and the applicant.
§ 210-117. Severability.
In the event that any portion of this Article is found to be invalid for
any reason by any court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall
be limited in its effect only to the portion of the Article actually adjudged
invalid and shall not be deemed to affect the operation on any other portion
hereof.
§ 210-118. Interpretation.
This Article shall be liberally construed to affect the purposes set forth
herein. In the event that this Article conflicts with state law, state law shall
take precedence.
which the Department of Planning and Development shall establish the
matters alleged in the notice by a preponderance of the evidence.
E. If the owner does not request a hearing, the procedures set forth in
Subsection C above shall be binding. If a hearing is requested, the
administrative officer will, within ten (10) days following the hearing,
serve on the owner an opinion in writing setting forth his conclusions
and the reasons therefor. Such opinion shall be deemed to be a first
notice pursuant to Subsection C hereof.
F. Thereafter, if the owner does not comply, the Department may enter
onto the premises and by use of municipal labor or outside contractors
or both, perform such work as is necessary to abate all violations.
G. The Director of Planning and Development shall then certify to City
Council the cost of such work, plus all administrative, clerical and legal
costs and overhead attributable thereto and shall present the same to
City Council.
H. The City Council may, by resolution, vote to cause the sum so certified
to become a lien upon the site or property, payable within the next
quarter's property taxes, and, if not then paid, bearing interest at the
same rate as delinquent taxes.
I. In addition to the remedies set forth herein, any violation of the
preventive maintenance standards of this Article shall be subject to the
penalties set forth in § 210-113 of this Article.

of Adjustment has already been granted.
