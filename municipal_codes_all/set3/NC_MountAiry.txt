PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Mount Airy, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1986 Code, as supplemented through August 19, 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Board of Commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the City of Mount Airy Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of A. Lawton Langford, President, and Becky Moore, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Barbara A. Jones, City Clerk for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

Sec. 1-6. - General penalty for violation of Code; abatement of nuisances; continuing violations. 
    Unless otherwise provided herein, each violation of this Code shall constitute a misdemeanor, except as otherwise provided by statute, and violations of such provisions of this Code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $50.00 or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 30 days, or both. 
    Violations of the following provisions of this Code shall constitute either a misdemeanor or, at the election of the City, shall subject the offender to a civil penalty upon the issuance of a citation for such violation as hereinafter provided. The civil penalty, if not paid to the Director of Finance within 15 days of the issuance of a citation, may be recovered by the City in a civil action in the nature of debt. Unless otherwise provided by a specific provision of this Code, such civil penalties shall be in the amount of $50.00 for each violation and each day any single violation continues shall be a separate violation. 
    In addition to the civil penalties set out above, any provision of this Code or any other City ordinance may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. In such case, the general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application of the City for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law. 
    In addition to the civil penalties set out above, any provision of this Code or any other City ordinance that makes unlawful a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced by injunction and order of abatement by general court of justice. When a violation of such a provision occurs, the City may apply to the appropriate division of the general court of justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of the property. The action shall by governed in all respects by the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including the Rules of Civil Procedure in general and Rule 65 in particular. 
    In addition to an injunction, the City may seek an order of abatement as a part of the judgment in the cause. An order of abatement may direct that buildings or other structures on the property be closed, demolished or removed; that fixtures, furniture or other movable property be removed from buildings on the property; that grass and weeds be cut; that improvements or repairs be made; or that any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with this Code or such ordinance. If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for contempt, and the City may execute the order of abatement. The City shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic's and materialman's lien. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by the clerk of superior court in an amount approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith. 
    The provisions of this Code and any other City ordinances may be enforced by one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this section. 
    Except as otherwise specifically provided, each day's continuing violation of any provision of this Code or any other City ordinance shall be a separate and distinct offense. 
    Any ordinances hereafter adopted by the Board of Commissioners, the violation of which shall incur a penalty, shall specify whether the enforcement shall be pursuant to the civil penalty or criminal penal provisions of this section. 
    Upon determination of a violation of any section of the Code, the penalty for which is a civil penalty, the City shall cause a warning citation to be issued to the violator setting out the nature of the violation, the section violated, the date of violation, an order to immediately cease the violation, or if the violation is in the nature of an infraction for which an order of abatement would be appropriate in a civil proceeding, a reasonable period of time is stated in which the violation must be abated. The warning citation shall specify that a second citation shall incur a civil penalty, together with costs and attorney fees. 
    Upon failure of the violator to obey the warning citation a civil citation shall be issued by the appropriate official of the City and either served directly on the violator, his duly designated agent, or registered agent if a corporation, either in person or posted in the United States mail service by first class mail addressed to the last known address of the violator as contained in the records of the City or obtained from the violator at the time of issuance of the warning citation. The violator shall be deemed to have been served upon the mailing of such citation. The citation shall direct the violator to appear before the Director of Finance of the City located in the Mount Airy Municipal Building, within 15 days of the date of the citation, or alternatively to pay the citation by mail. The violation for which the citation is issued must have been corrected by the time the citation is paid, otherwise further citations shall be issued. Citations may be issued for each day the offense continues until the prohibited activity is ceased or abated. 
    If the violator fails to respond to a citation within 15 days of its issuance, and pay the penalty prescribed therein, the City may institute a civil action in the nature of debt in the appropriate division of the North Carolina General Court of Justice for the collection of the penalty, costs, attorney fees, and such other relief as permitted by law.

At regular periods, the Electrical Inspector shall visit all premises where work may be done under annual permits and shall inspect all electric wiring, devices, appliances and equipment installed under such a permit since the date of such inspector's last previous inspection, and shall issue a certificate of approval for such work as is found to be in conformity with the provisions of this article, after the fee required has been paid. Upon inspection, if the installation is not found to be fully in conformity with the provisions of this article, the Electrical Inspector shall at once forward to the permit holder a written notice stating the defects which have been found. 
(e)  Inspection prior to concealment. When any part of a wiring installation is to be hidden from view by the permanent placement of parts of the building, the person installing the wiring shall notify the Electrical Inspector and such parts of the wiring installation shall not be concealed until they have been inspected and approved by the Electrical Inspector, or until 24 hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, have elapsed from the time of such notification; provided, that, on large installations, where the concealment of parts of the wiring proceeds continuously, the person installing the wiring shall give the Electrical Inspector due notice and inspections shall be made periodically during the progress of the work. 
(f)  Inspection upon completion of installation. Upon completion of any installation for which a permit and inspection is required, it shall be the duty of the person installing same to notify the Electrical Inspector, who shall inspect the installation within 24 hours of the time such notice is given or as soon thereafter as practicable.

Sec. 4-68. - Inspections; duty of owners and occupants. 
(a)  For the purpose of making inspections, the Inspector is hereby authorized to enter, examine and survey at all reasonable times all dwellings, dwelling units, rooming houses, rooming units and the premises associated therewith. The owner or occupant of every dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house or rooming unit or the person in charge thereof shall give the Inspector free access to such dwelling and its premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of such inspection, examination and survey. 
(b)  Every occupant of a dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house, or rooming unit shall give the owner thereof, or his agent or employee, access to any part of such dwelling or dwelling unit and its premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of making such repairs or alterations as are necessary to effect compliance with the provisions of this article or with any lawful order issued pursuant to the provisions of this article. 
(Note: When permission to inspect a dwelling or its premises is denied, the Inspector must obtain a warrant to inspect. G.S. § 15-27.2 provides for the issuance of warrants for the conduct of inspections authorized by law. The N.C. Court of Appeals, in In Re Dwelling, 24 N.C. App. 17 (1974), has held that the consent of the tenant-occupant who was in actual possession and control of the premises was sufficient to authorize an inspection without a warrant, notwithstanding the fact that the owner had objected to the warrantless search. When faced with a situation where permission to inspect is denied, inspectors are advised to seek the advice of the City Attorney.)

    At any time where the City of Mount Airy Codes Inspector has obtained certification to act as a building inspector, the following codes shall be enforced to further protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Mount Airy by allowing the building inspector to placard unsafe buildings. 
(1)  Periodic inspections. The inspection department shall make periodic inspections, subject to the council's directions, for unsafe, unsanitary, or otherwise hazardous and unlawful conditions in structures within its territorial jurisdiction. In addition, it shall make inspections when it has reason to believe that such conditions may exist in a particular structure. In exercising this power, members of the department shall have a right to enter on any premises within the jurisdiction of the department at all reasonable hours for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action, upon presentation of proper credentials. 
(2)  Defects in buildings to be corrected. When a local inspector finds any defects in a building, or finds that the building has not been constructed in accordance with the applicable State and local laws, or that a building because of its condition is dangerous or contains fire hazardous conditions, it shall be his duty to notify the owner or occupant of the building of its defects, hazardous conditions, or failure to comply with law. The owner or occupant shall each immediately remedy the defects, hazardous conditions, or violations of law in the property he owns. 
(3)  Unsafe buildings condemned. 
a.  Residential building. Every building which shall appear to the inspector to be especially dangerous to life because of its liability to fire or because of bad condition of walls, overloaded floors, defective construction, decay, unsafe wiring or heating system, inadequate means of egress, or other causes, shall be held to be unsafe, and the inspector shall affix a notice of the dangerous character of the structure to a conspicuous place on the exterior wall of said building. 
b.  Nonresidential building or structure. An inspector may declare a nonresidential building or structure within a community development target area to be unsafe if it meets both of the following conditions: 
1.  It appears to the inspector to be vacant or abandoned. 
2.  It appears to the inspector to be in such dilapidated condition as to cause or contribute to blight, disease, vagrancy, fire or safety hazard, to be a danger to children, or to tend to attract persons intent on criminal activities or other activities which would constitute a public nuisance. 
If an inspector declares a nonresidential building or structure to be unsafe, the inspector must affix a notice of the unsafe character of the structure to a conspicuous place on the exterior wall of the building. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "community development target area" means an area that has characteristics of a development zone under G.S. § 105-129.3A, a "nonresidential development area" under G.S. § 160A-503(10), or an area with similar characteristics designated by the City council as being in special need of revitalization for the benefit and welfare of its citizens. 
(4)  Removing notice from condemned building. If any person shall remove any notice that has been affixed to any building or structure by a local inspector of any municipality and that states the dangerous character of the building or structure, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. 
(5)  Action in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner of a building or structure that has been condemned as unsafe pursuant to G.S. § 160A-426 shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the local inspector shall give him written notice, by certified or registered mail to his last known address or by personal service, 
a.  That the building or structure is in a condition that appears to meet one or more of the following conditions: 
1.  Constitutes a fire or safety hazard. 
2.  Is dangerous to life, health, or other property. 
3.  Is likely to cause or contribute to blight, disease, vagrancy, or danger to children.

b.  That a hearing will be held before the inspector at a designated place and time, not later than ten days after the date of the notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and 
c.  That following the hearing, the inspector may issue such order to repair, close, vacate, or demolish the building or structure as appears appropriate. 
If the name or whereabouts of the owner cannot after due diligence be discovered, the notice shall be considered properly and adequately served if a copy thereof is posted on the outside of the building or structure in question at least ten days prior to the hearing and a notice of the hearing is published in a newspaper having general circulation in the City at least once not later than one week prior to the hearing. 
(6)  Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to the notice prescribed in G.S. § 160A-428, the inspector shall find that the building or structure is in a condition that constitutes a fire or safety hazard or renders it dangerous to life, health, or other property, he shall make an order in writing, directed to the owner of such building or structure, requiring the owner to remedy the defective conditions by repairing, closing, vacating, or demolishing the building or structure or taking other necessary steps, within such period, not less than 60 days, as the inspector may prescribe; provided, that where the inspector finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser period as may be feasible. 
(7)  Appeal; finality of order if not appealed. Any owner who has received an order under G.S. § 160A-429 may appeal from the order to the City council by giving notice of appeal in writing to the inspector and to the City clerk within ten days following issuance of the order. In the absence of an appeal, the order of the inspector shall be final. The City council shall hear and render a decision in an appeal within a reasonable time. The City council may affirm, modify and affirm, or revoke the order. 
(8)  Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or structure fails to comply with an order issued pursuant to G.S. § 160A-429 from which no appeal has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the City council following an appeal, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. 
(9)  Civil and equitable enforcement. 
a.  Civil enforcement. Whenever any violation is denominated a misdemeanor under the provisions of this part, the City, either in addition to or in lieu of other remedies, may initiate any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent, restrain, correct, or abate the violation or to prevent the occupancy of the building or structure involved. 
b.  Equitable enforcement. In the case of a nonresidential building or structure declared unsafe under G.S. § 160A-426(b), a City may, in lieu of taking action under subsection (a), cause the building or structure to be removed or demolished. The amounts incurred by the City in connection with the removal or demolition shall be a lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred. The lien shall be filed, have the same priority, and be collected in the same manner as liens for special assessments provided in article II of this chapter. If the building or structure is removed or demolished by the City, the City shall sell the usable materials of the building and any personal property, fixtures, or appurtenances found in or attached to the building. The City shall credit the proceeds of the sale against the cost of the removal or demolition. Any balance remaining from the sale shall be deposited with the clerk of superior court of the county where the property is located and shall be disbursed by the court to the person found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of the court.

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 4-100. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in G.S. Pt. 6, Art. 21 of Ch. 143; Pt. 3, 5, and 8 of Art. 19 of Ch. 160A; and Art. 8 of Ch. 160A, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
    Therefore, the Commissioners of the City of Mount Airy, North Carolina, does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 2010-005, Art. 1 § A, 8-6-09) 
Sec. 4-101. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The floodprone areas within the jurisdiction of the City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in floodprone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards. 
(Ord. No. 2010-005, Art. I, § B, 8-6-09) 
Sec. 4-102. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within floodprone areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 2010-005, Art. 1, § C, 8-6-09) 
Sec. 4-103. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect human life, safety, and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in floodprone areas; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area.

DIVISION 2. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 4-111. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application. 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Garages, carports and storage sheds are common urban accessory structures. Pole barns, hay sheds and the like qualify as accessory structures on farms, and may or may not be located on the same parcel as the farm dwelling or shop building. 
    Addition (to an existing building) means an extension or increase in the floor area or height of a building or structure.

    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) means a determination of the water surface elevations of the base flood as published in the flood insurance study. When the BFE has not been provided in a "special flood hazard area," it may be obtained from engineering studies available from a federal, state, or other source using FEMA approved engineering methodologies. This elevation, when combined with the "freeboard," establishes the "regulatory flood protection elevation." 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Building see "structure." 
    Chemical storage facility means a building, portion of a building, or exterior area adjacent to a building used for the storage of any chemical or chemically reactive products.

    Disposal means, as defined in G.S. § 130A-290(a)(6), the discharge, deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of any solid waste into or on any land or water so that the solid waste or any constituent part of the solid waste may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including groundwaters. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building which has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns. 
    Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation, buildings, structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
    Existing manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) was completed before the initial effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the community. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

    Freeboard means the height added to the base flood elevation (BFE) to account for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater that the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, blockage of bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. The base flood elevation (BFE) plus the freeboard establishes the "regulatory flood protection elevation." 
    Functionally dependent facility means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located in close proximity to water, limited to a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.

(4)  Certified as contributing to the historical significance of a historic district designated by a community with a "certified local government (CLG) program." 
Certified local government (CLG) programs are approved by the U.S. Department of the Interior in cooperation with the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources through the State Historic Preservation Officer as having met the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended in 1980. 
    Lowest adjacent grade (LAG) means the elevation of the ground, sidewalk or patio slab immediately next to the building, or deck support, after completion of the building. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such an enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this article. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Market value means the building value, not including the land value and that of any accessory structures or other improvements on the lot. Market value may be established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated for age of building and quality of construction (actual cash value); or adjusted tax assessed values. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of this article, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) as corrected in 1988, or other vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain, to which base flood elevations (BFEs) shown on a FIRM are referenced. Refer to each FIRM panel to determine datum used. 
    New construction means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of the initial floodplain management regulations and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    Nonencroachment area means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot as designated in the flood insurance study report. 
    Post-FIRM means construction or other development for which the "start of construction" occurred on or after the effective date of the initial Flood Insurance Rate Map. 
    Pre-FIRM means construction or other development for which the "start of construction" occurred before the effective date of the initial Flood Insurance Rate Map.

    Reference level means the top of the lowest floor for structures within special flood hazard areas designated as zone A1-A30, AE, A, A99 or AO. 
    Regulatory flood protection elevation means the "base flood elevation" plus the "freeboard." In "special flood hazard areas" where base flood elevations (BFEs) have been determined, this elevation shall be the BFE with one foot of freeboard. In "special flood hazard areas" where no BFE has been established, this elevation shall be at least one foot above the highest adjacent grade. 
    Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state and community floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Salvage yard means any nonresidential property used for the storage, collection, and/or recycling of any type of equipment, and including but not limited to vehicles, appliances and related machinery.

    Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of being flooded in any given year, as determined in section 4-122 of this article. 
    Start of construction means substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, or a gas, liquid, or liquefied gas storage tank that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure during any one-year period whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. See definition of "substantial improvement." Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during any one-year period for which the cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any correction of existing violations of state or community health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in divisions 4 and 5 is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation (WSE) means the height, in relation to mean sea level, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas. 
    Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

Chapter 4.3 - CABLE TELEVISION SERVICES 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 4.3-1. - Statement of intent and purpose. 
(a)  The City of Mount Airy, North Carolina, pursuant to applicable Federal and State law, is authorized to grant one or more nonexclusive franchises to construct, operate, maintain, and reconstruct cable systems within the incorporated area of the City. 
(b)  The City Board of Commissioners finds that cable service has become an integral part of its citizens' lives, and that evolving cable systems have the potential to play an even more dramatic role in the future, providing great benefits and advanced capabilities to the City. At the same time, the Board further finds that the public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers that are vested in the City or such persons as the City designates. 
(c)  In order to ensure that the City and its residents receive state-of-the-art cable services and capabilities as this technology further evolves, all franchises granted pursuant to this chapter will be subject to periodic review and modifications to keep current with changing law, technology, and services. It is the intent of this chapter to help ensure that local cable operators provide the best possible cable service to residents of the City, and any franchises issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof. 
(d)  Further, it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to provide entertainment and information services to the City's residents, and may have the capacity to provide a variety of broadband, interactive communications services to institutions and individuals. For these purposes, the following goals underlie the regulations contained herein: 
(1)  Cable television services should be made available to all of the City's residents at the lowest reasonable cost. 
(2)  The system should be capable of accommodating both the present and reasonably foreseeable future state-of-the-art cable television needs of the City. 
(3)  The systems authorized by this chapter shall be responsive to the needs and interests of the local community, and shall provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and services to the public. 
(4)  Each of the above-enumerated goals shall be sought to the maximum extent, taking into account the costs and benefits to the residents of the City of Mount Airy. 
(e)  The Board further finds that on-going industry consolidation could result in less local accountability, and that, therefore, stringent customer service standards, including liquidated damages provisions, may be the only practical means of ensuring compliance and approximating the costs of franchise agreement non-compliance to the City and its residents.

    A franchise agreement shall establish the term of each individual franchise. 
(Ord. No. 05-016, Art. 4, § 4-4, 12-9-04) 
Sec. 4.3-35. - Federal, State, and City jurisdiction. 
(a)  The City shall exercise appropriate regulatory authority under the provisions of this chapter, the Cable Act, and all applicable laws. This authority shall be vested in the City of Mount Airy City Board and administered through the City Manager or his/her designee in order to provide day-to-day administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and any franchise granted hereunder, and to carry out the City's responsibilities with regard to cable service. 
(b)  This chapter shall be construed in a manner consistent with all applicable Federal and State laws. 
(c)  In the event that the Federal or State government discontinues preemption in any area of cable communications over which it currently exercises jurisdiction in such manner as to expand rather than limit municipal regulatory authority, grantor may, if it so elects, adopt rules and regulations in these areas to the extent permitted by law, provided the same do not materially alter the rights and obligations of a grantee under any existing franchise. 
(d)  Grantee's rights are subject to the police powers of the City to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to the health, safety, and welfare of the public. Grantee shall comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the City pursuant to that power. 
(e)  The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all franchises granted or renewed after the effective date of this chapter. This chapter shall also apply such franchise or applicable law. In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of a franchise agreement and the provisions of this chapter, and other generally applicable regulatory ordinances of the City, the specific terms of the franchise agreement shall control. A franchise agreement (including all of grantee's particular rights, powers, protections, privileges, immunities and obligations associated therewith as the same exist on the date hereof) shall constitute a legally binding contract between the City and grantee, and as such, cannot be amended, modified or changed by the City without the consent of grantee in any manner whatsoever, whether by ordinance, rule, regulation or otherwise, to impose on grantee more stringent or burdensome requirements or conditions; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall preclude the City from the proper exercise of its police powers, or its powers of eminent domain. 
(f)  In the event of a change in State or Federal law which by its terms would require the City to amend this chapter, the parties shall modify the existing franchise in a mutually agreed upon manner. 
(g)  Grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or a franchise agreement by reason of any failure of the City to enforce prompt compliance.

(Ord. No. 05-016, Art. 4, § 4-6, 12-9-04) 
Sec. 4.3-37. - Franchise agreement. 
(a)  Every grantee shall agree to the terms and provisions of a franchise agreement as negotiated between the grantee and the grantor. 
(b)  In addition to those matters required elsewhere in this chapter to be included in the franchise agreement, each franchise agreement must contain the following express representations by each grantee: 
(1)  Grantee has examined all of the provisions of this chapter and accepts and agrees to all of the provisions of this chapter, as it exists as of the effective date of the grantee's franchise agreement, except as set forth in subsection 4.3-35(d) hereof and any supplementary specifications as to construction, operation, or maintenance of the system which the City may include in the franchise agreement, unless otherwise agreed in the applicable franchise agreement. 
(2)  Grantee recognizes, unless otherwise agreed in the applicable franchise agreement, the right of the City to adopt such additional regulations of general applicability as it shall find necessary in the exercise of its police power. 
(c)  Every franchise agreement shall contain such further conditions or provisions as may be negotiated between the City and a grantee, except that no such conditions or provisions shall be such as to conflict with any provisions of State or Federal law. In case of any conflict or of any ambiguity between any terms or provisions of a franchise agreement and this chapter, the provisions of the franchise agreement shall control.

(Ord. No. 05-016, Art. 4, § 4-9, 12-9-04) 
Sec. 4.3-41. - Grant of additional franchise and competing service. 
    Competing or overlapping franchises may have an adverse impact on the public rights-of-way and on the quality and availability of services to the public. In considering whether to grant one or more additional franchises, the City shall specifically consider, and address in a written report or in provisions of the franchise agreement, the following issues: 
(1)  The positive and/or negative impact of an additional franchise on the community. 
(2)  The ability and willingness of the specific applicant in question to provide cable services to the franchise area. 
(3)  The amount of time it will take the applicant to complete construction of the proposed system and activate service in the franchise area; and, whether the applicant can complete construction and activation of its system in a timely manner. 
(4)  The financial capabilities of the applicant and its guaranteed commitment to make the necessary investment to erect, maintain, and operate the proposed cable system for the duration of the franchise term. In order to ensure that any prospective grantee does have the requisite current financial capabilities, the City may request equity and debt financing commitment letters, current audited financial statements, bonds, letters of credit, or other documentation to demonstrate to the City's satisfaction that the requisite funds to construct and operate the proposed system are available. 
(5)  The quality and technical reliability of the proposed system, based upon the applicant's plan of construction and the method of distribution of signals, and the applicant's technical qualifications to construct and operate such system. 
(6)  The experience of the applicant in the erection, maintenance, and operation of a cable system. 
(7)  The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate one or more additional cable systems and the potential disruption of those public rights-of-way and private property that may occur if one or more additional franchises are granted. 
(8)  The likelihood and ability of the applicant to continue to provide competing cable service to subscribers within the franchise area for the duration of the franchise. 
(9)  Such other information as the City may deem appropriate to be considered prior to granting any competing or overlapping franchise. 
(10)  The purpose of this article is to ensure that any competition which may occur among grantees will be on terms which when taken as a whole are non-discriminatory according to Federal law. 
(Ord. No. 05-016, Art. 4, § 4-11, 12-9-04) 
Sec. 4.3-42. - Permits for non-franchised entities. 
(a)  The City may issue a license, easement, or other permit to a person other than the grantee to permit that person to traverse any portion of the grantee's franchise area within the City in order to provide service outside, but not within the City. Such license or easement, absent a grant of a franchise in accordance with this chapter, shall not authorize nor permit said person to provide cable service to any subscriber within the City nor render any other service within the City. 
(b)  The granting of such license, easement or permit shall be conditioned upon the payment of fee for occupancy of the public right-of-way to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 05-016, Art. 4, § 4-12, 12-9-04) 
Sec. 4.3-43. - Review for competition. 
    The City recognizes that the cable television and telecommunications industries are in a period of convergence, that the technologies and services provided by these industries are rapidly changing, and that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 promoted and encouraged competition between and among these formerly discrete industries. At this time it is premature to know fully the extent to which there will be changes in law, technology or services that may impact entities that have been or may be granted franchises or licenses to use the City's rights-of-way. It is the desire of the City to be a communications friendly City that encourages the development of competitive advanced communications capabilities for the benefit of all its citizens. For this reason the regulatory ordinances and franchises of the City should not impede or restrict the fair opportunity to compete, but rather are intended to provide uniform and consistent requirements for all similarly situated providers. 
(Ord. No. 05-016, Art. 4, § 4-13, 12-9-04) 
Sec. 4.3-44. - Application and renewal fees. 
(a)  An application fee shall not be deemed to be "franchise fees" within the meaning of Article 622 of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 542), and such payments shall not be deemed to be (i) "payments in kind" or any involuntary payments chargeable against the compensation to be paid to the City by grantee, or (ii) part of the compensation to be paid to the City by grantee pursuant to this chapter or a franchise agreement. 
(b)  All applicants for an initial franchise grant shall submit an application fee of $600.00 to compensate the City for its costs in reviewing, preparing and awarding a franchise, including the costs of outside consultants. Upon grant of a franchise the City may request the payment of an additional fee to the extent that the reasonable costs of the franchise review and negotiation process exceed the initial application fee amount. Consistent with the Cable Act, all such fees shall not constitute or be credited towards a grantee's franchise fee obligations. Reasonable costs include staff time, professional fees, and administrative costs as determined by the City to be necessary.

(Ord. No. 05-016, Art. 7, § 7-10, 12-9-04) 
Sec. 4.3-91. - Service area and line extension policy. 
(a)  No grantee may discriminate in the build-out of its system to a particular area of the City in providing service to an individual or groups of residents on the basis of race, creed, religion or economic condition. Unless the franchise agreement provides otherwise, every grantee shall serve all resident of the City. In newly annexed areas of the City the grantee shall provide service within 24 months to those areas with populations of at least 15 residential dwelling units per cable mile as measured from a grantee's existing distribution system. The franchise agreement shall provide a schedule of the areas to be served, and the specific build-out requirements of the grantee, and shall also describe the process for extending service to areas that will meet minimum density requirements at some future date. Unless the franchise agreement provides otherwise, every grantee shall extend service to commercial areas at no additional cost where the cost to do so does not exceed the same cost of providing service in a residential area with a density of 15 homes per mile. 
(b)  During the initial construction phase of a new system, a grantee may implement its system in stages pursuant to a schedule and line extension policy established in its franchise agreement that serves all areas of the City equally, provided that any deviation from the service and line extension requirements of this chapter do not discriminate between different areas of the City on the basis of race, creed, religion or economic condition. A grantee of any such new franchise shall comply with all customer service obligations with respect to customers whose premises are passed by portions of the grantee's network which are fully activated, tested and available for service. 
(c)  Cost-sharing. In areas with fewer than 15 homes per proposed cable mile, grantee shall offer a cost-sharing arrangement to residents. Grantee shall bear its pro rata share of the current construction costs based upon the actual number of homes per mile. The cost-sharing arrangement shall consist of the following: On the request of a resident desiring service, grantee shall prepare, at its cost, an engineering survey and cost analysis to determine the cost of the plant extension required to provide service to the resident from the closest usable point on the cable system. The cost of construction shall be allocated based on the following formula: If a request for extension into a residential area requires the construction of cable plant which does not pass at least 15 homes per cable mile, a proportionate share of construction costs shall be borne by grantee and by the subscribers. For example, if there are seven dwelling units per mile, grantee's share will equal seven-fifteenths of the construction cost. The remaining cost will be shared equally by each subscriber in the area to be constructed. The line extension formula shall also be applied to a portion of a cable mile meeting proportionate density requirements. For example, if there are seven dwelling units per one-half mile, the grantee shall construct the plant. The cost sharing described above would be utilized if there were less than the proportionate share of dwelling units per the portion of a mile needed to reach the dwelling units. Should additional subscribers request cable service, subscribers utilizing the cost-sharing plan for extension shall be reimbursed pro-rata for their contribution or a proportional share thereof. In such case, the pro-rata shares shall be recalculated and each new subscriber shall pay the new pro-rata share, and all prior subscribers shall receive refunds. In any event, at the end of 24 months from completion of the project, the subscribers are no longer eligible for refunds, and the amounts paid by subscribers will be credited to the plant account of the grantee. The average cost of the line extension shall be recalculated annually based upon the current costs of labor and material. Each subscriber contributing toward the direct cost of the line extension shall waive all ownership interest in the line extension. All equipment and components of the line extension, including, but not limited to, cable wire, electronics and pedestals shall at all times remain the exclusive property of the grantee.

    In addition to free cable service required by the ordinance, grantee shall provide one service feed to the City Administration Building (unless otherwise specified by City) that shall receive without charge all basic and expanded basic cable programming provided by grantee. Such service shall be provided in such a manner that the City may monitor the programming and use of the cable system for compliance with the franchise agreement and this chapter. The service provided pursuant to this requirement shall be in a secure office location, and not in a location open to public viewing.

    All of grantee's construction, installation, operation, repair and maintenance, and the arrangement of its lines, cables and other appurtenances, on public or private property, shall be conducted in such a manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners that may be affected. In the event such work is not in accordance with applicable rules and regulations, the City may require the removal, within such period of time after notice as is reasonable under the circumstances, of grantee's lines, cables and appurtenances from the rights-of-way in question, at the sole expense of the grantee. 
(Ord. No. 05-016, Art. 8, § 8-3, 12-9-04) 
Sec. 4.3-114. - Repair of property. 
    Grantee shall promptly repair and restore any City or private property which may be damaged as a result of the construction, installation, operation, repair, maintenance or removal of the cable system. Any such property damaged or destroyed shall be promptly repaired and restored by grantee, at grantee's sole cost and expense to the reasonable satisfaction of the City, to its condition prior to being damaged, or shall be replaced by grantee with equivalent property. The City may inspect and approve the condition of the right-of-ways and cables, wires, attachments, and poles after restoration. The liability, indemnity, insurance and performance bond as provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of any removal and until the grantee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement. In the event of a failure by the grantee to complete any restoration work required by the City within the time as may be established by the City and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City, the City may, following reasonable notice to the grantee, cause such work to be done and the grantee shall reimburse the City the cost thereof within 30 days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs, or the City may at its option recover such costs through the performance bond provided by grantee. The City shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this article.

Sec. 4.3-115. - Erection of poles. 
    Grantee shall not erect any pole on or along any rights-of-way in an existing aerial utility system without the advance written approval of the City.

(Ord. No. 05-016, Art. 8, § 8-5, 12-9-04) 
Sec. 4.3-116. - Reservations of street rights. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the City from constructing storm or sanitary sewers, grading, paving, repairing or altering any rights-of-way, or laying down, repairing or removing water mains, traffic signal control systems, City fiber plant, or constructing or establishing any public utility, service or other public work that the City may operate or undertake now or in the future. All such work shall be done, insofar as practicable, in such manner as not to obstruct, injure or prevent the free use and operation of poles, wires, conduits, conductors, pipes or appurtenances of grantee. If City in its reasonable judgment shall determine that grantee's facilities interfere with the construction location or repair of any rights-of-way or public improvement, then all such facilities of grantee shall be removed or replaced, or temporarily disconnected, in such manner as shall be directed by the City so that the same shall not interfere with the public works of the City. Such removal or replacement shall be at the expense of grantee; provided, however, that nothing in this chapter shall preclude grantee from seeking reimbursement for removal or replacement costs from any public funds generally available to rights-of-way users for the reimbursement of such costs. 
(Ord. No. 05-016, Art. 8, § 8-6, 12-9-04) 
Sec. 4.3-117. - Underground installation. 
    In those areas within the City where cable television, telephone, or electrical facilities are currently placed underground, all cable system facilities shall remain or be placed underground. In areas where either telephone or electric utility facilities are above ground at the time of installation, grantee may install its cable system facilities above ground, provided that at such time as both electric and telephone utility facilities are placed underground, grantee shall likewise place its cable system facilities underground without cost to the City. Nothing contained in this article shall require a grantee to construct, operate and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances, except that grantee shall take steps to minimize the number and visual impact of such facilities. If the grantor reimburses any utility for such relocation, grantee shall be similarly reimbursed. This article shall not prevent the City or any of its agencies or joint agencies from requiring the installation or relocation of cable services facilities underground pursuant to a separate ordinance or regulation or requirement imposed in accordance with the exercise of the general police power or regulatory function of such agency or joint agency.

(b)  Grantee shall provide strand and trench maps without detailed measurement calculations in a format mutually agreeable to both the City and grantee. Such information shall be subject to and not restrict any other City ordinances. City agrees to treat the maps as proprietary information to the extent provided under law, or as may be indicated in City ordinances. 
(c)  Grantee shall provide a contact number for the City to call in emergency situations requiring an immediate response on the part of the City. If the grantee does not properly and effectively identify the precise location of its facilities within a reasonable period of time taking into account the circumstance of an emergency call from the City, the City shall not be responsible for damage to the grantee's facilities. 
(Ord. No. 05-016, Art. 8, § 8-8, 12-9-04) 
Sec. 4.3-119. - Clearing poles and cables. 
    Grantee shall have the right to remove, trim, cut and to keep clear of its poles, cables, underground conduits and related equipment the trees in and along the rights-of-way, but, in the exercise of such right, grantee shall not cut such trees to any greater extent than is reasonably necessary for the construction, erection, installation, maintenance and use of cable system equipment. Except in emergency situations, grantee shall not remove, trim or cut such trees from any rights-of-way without first providing reasonable notice to the City of its intention to do so, such notice to be delivered not less than ten days in advance. The grantee shall compensate the City or any private owners of such trees for any damage proximately caused by grantee's negligent conduct.

Secs. 4.3-123-4.3-140. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VI. - ADMINISTRATION AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 

Sec. 4.3-141. - Franchise fee. 
(a)  The administration of this chapter or the franchise agreement imposes upon the City additional regulatory responsibility and expense, and in consideration of permission to use the rights-of-way of the City for the construction, operation and maintenance, of a cable system within the City, a grantee of any franchise hereunder shall pay to the City a franchise fee in an amount as designated in the franchise agreement, up to the maximum amount allowed by applicable law. To the extent that applicable law changes the maximum authorized franchise fee, the City reserves the right to change the franchise fee as stated in the franchise agreement, by adopting an ordinance establishing the new franchise fee rate and allowing reasonable notice to the grantee for administration of the change. The City shall hold a public hearing prior to adopting any change in the franchise fee. 
(b)  Payments due grantor under this article shall be computed quarterly, for the preceding quarter. Each quarterly payment shall be due and payable no later than 30 days after the end of the preceding quarter. Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief report by a grantee showing the basis for the computation. All such payments shall be certified as correct by an officer of the grantee. 
(c)  No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim grantor may have for further sums payable under the provisions of this chapter or a franchise agreement. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and re-computation by grantor or its designee at any time during any calendar year (but not more than once per calendar year) upon 20 calendar days' notice, which shall include a request for any documents sought to be reviewed. Audits shall be at the expense of the grantee if the additional amount due is greater than two percent of the amount paid. Any additional amount due to the City as a result of the audit shall be paid within 60 days following written notice to the grantee by the City which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. Grantor's right to audit and grantee's obligation to retain records related to the franchise fee audit shall expire three years from the date on which the most recent franchise fee payment by the grantee was due from the time of written notice of request of audit. 
(d)  In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified herein, grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the City's primary depository bank during the period that such unpaid amount is owed. 
(Ord. No. 05-016, Art. 9, § 9-1, 12-9-04) 
Sec. 4.3-142. - Security fund (bond). 
    Each grantee shall maintain a security fund with the City to ensure compliance with this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement, in an amount and in a manner as set forth in the grantee's franchise agreement. 
(Ord. No. 05-016, Art. 9, § 9-2, 12-9-04) 
Sec. 4.3-143. - Penalties procedure. 
(a)  Whenever grantor has reason to believe that a grantee has violated any material provision of a franchise agreement or this chapter, grantor shall first notify the grantee of the material violation and demand correction within a reasonable time, which shall not be less than 20 days in the case of the failure of a grantee to pay any sum or other amount due the grantor under a franchise agreement, and 30 days in all other cases. If a grantee fails to correct the violation within the time prescribed, or if a grantee is unable to correct the violation and fails to commence corrective action within the time prescribed and to diligently remedy such violation thereafter, the grantee shall then be given written notice of not less than 20 days for public comment. Said notice shall indicate with reasonable specificity the violation alleged to have occurred. 
(b)  At the public hearing, the Board shall hear and consider all relevant evidence and thereafter render findings and a decision based upon the evidence. Any such hearing must, at a minimum, provide the grantee a full and fair opportunity to be heard by the Board. 
(c)  In the event the Board finds that a grantee has corrected the violation or promptly commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from grantor and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy the violation, or that no violation has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate and no penalty or other sanction shall be imposed. 
(d)  In the event the Board finds that a violation exists and that a grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or did not promptly commence and diligently proceed to correct the violation, the Board may impose liquidated damages to be collected from the security fund, as set out in the franchise agreement. 
(e)  If the Board elects to assess liquidated damages, then such election shall constitute grantor's exclusive remedy for a period of 60 days. Thereafter, if a grantee remains in non-compliance, the grantor may pursue any other available remedy. 
(f)  In the event that a franchise is cancelled or terminated by reason of the default of a grantee, the security fund deposited pursuant to a franchise agreement shall remain in effect and available to the grantor until all pending claims or penalties are resolved or settled, after which point any remaining amounts in the security fund shall revert to the grantee. 
(g)  The rights reserved to grantor with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of grantor, whether reserved by a franchise agreement, this chapter, or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right grantor may have. 
(h)  In instances of repeated violations, whether remedied or not, the grantor shall serve special notice outlining additional remediation requirements. Failure to cure, as measured by repeated instances of the same violation, is evidence of an evasive practice and may lead to revocation under section 4.3-145. 
(i)  Grantee acknowledges that non-compliance with the provisions of the franchise agreement and this chapter will harm subscribers and the City and the amounts of actual damages will be difficult or impossible to ascertain. The City may therefore assess the following liquidated damages against grantee for unexcused non-compliance with the requirements of the franchise agreement and this chapter. Grantee acknowledges that the liquidated damages set forth below are a reasonable approximation of actual damages and that this provision is intended to provide compensation and is not a penalty. All damages provided shall be cumulative, unless expressly stated. 
(1)  For failure to materially complete construction or extend service in accordance with the ordinance and the franchise agreement: $250.00 per calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
(2)  For failure to materially comply with requirements for public access channels: $250.00 per calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
(3)  For failure to comply with the material requirements of the I-Net provisions of the ordinance/franchise agreement: $250.00 per calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
(4)  For repeated, willful or continuing failure to submit reports, maintain records, provide documents or information: $250.00 per calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
(5)  For failure to comply with the material requirements of the customer service standards: $250.00 per calendar quarter the violation continues; 
(6)  For failure to comply with the transfer provisions: $250.00 per calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
(7)  For violation of other material provisions of the ordinance and the franchise agreement: up to $250.00 per calendar day for each day the violation continues.

(2)  A grantee attempts to evade any of the material provisions of this chapter or a franchise agreement; 
(3)  A grantee practices an act of fraud or deceit upon the grantor;

(b)  Procedure. 
(1)  Whenever grantor has reason to believe that there may be grounds for revocation of a franchise, grantor shall first notify the grantee in writing of its basis for believing grounds for revocation exist. Such notice shall indicate with reasonable specificity the grounds for revocation that are believed to exist so that the grantee may have a reasonable opportunity to cure or otherwise address the same. If a grantee fails to adequately cure or address the purported grounds for revocation within 30 days of such notice, then the grantor may, upon 30 days written notice to the grantee, commence a public administrative hearing to determine whether there exists any ground for revocation. 
(2)  The administrative hearing shall be conducted so as to protect the full due process rights of the parties and provide for, at a minimum, the right to have counsel, the right to call and cross examine witnesses, and the right to a full transcript of the proceedings. 
(3)  After the close of the hearing, grantor or the designated hearing officer shall issue a written decision based on the record of the proceedings, stating with specificity the findings and reasons supporting the decision. 
(4)  Upon revocation, a grantee shall have a period of 120 days subsequent to the date of the formal adoption of a revocation of the franchise by the City within which to file an appeal with a court of competent jurisdiction.

(a)  Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a part of a system, a grantee shall notify grantor of such fact and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in control of the grantee has taken place, and the provisions of this chapter governing the consent to transfer or change in ownership shall apply without regard to how such transfer or change in ownership occurred. 
(b)  Apart from and supplemental to the right to revoke a franchise, grantor shall have the right to cancel a franchise agreement 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of a grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless: 
(1)  Within 120 days after its election or appointment, the receiver or trustee has fully complied with all the provisions of grantee's franchise agreement and this chapter and remedied all defaults thereunder; and 
(2)  Such receiver or trustee, within said 120 days, has executed an agreement, duly approved by a court having jurisdiction, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and every provision of this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement.

(1)  Upon revocation of a franchise, a fair valuation shall be an equitable value that shall not include any sum attributable to the value of the franchise itself, and plant and property shall be valued according to its book value at the time of revocation, or the system's initial cost less depreciation and salvage.

(a)  No grantee shall sell, transfer, lease, assign, subject, or dispose of, in whole or in part, an interest in or control of a franchise or cable system or any of the rights or privileges granted by a franchise agreement, without the prior consent of the grantor, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed and may be denied only upon a good faith finding by the grantor that the proposed transferee lacks the legal, technical, or financial qualifications to consummate the transaction and operate the system so as to perform its obligations under this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement. This article shall not apply to sales of property or equipment in the normal course of business. Consent from the grantor shall not be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure indebtedness, or for a transfer to a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a grantee. 
(b)  The following additional events shall be deemed to be a sale, assignment, or other transfer of an interest in or control of a grantee or its franchise or cable system requiring compliance with this article: (i) the sale, assignment, or other transfer of all or a majority of a grantee's assets; (ii) the sale, assignment, or other transfer of capital stock or partnership, membership, or other equity interests in a grantee by one or more of its existing shareholders, partners, members, or other equity owners so as to create a new controlling interest in a grantee; (iii) the issuance of additional capital stock or partnership, membership or other equity interest by a grantee so as to create a new controlling interest in a grantee; and (iv) a grantee's agreement to transfer management or operation of the grantee or the system. The term "controlling interest" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. 
(c)  In the case of any sale or transfer of ownership of an interest in or control of a grantee or its franchise or cable system, the City shall have 120 days to act upon any request for approval of such sale or transfer that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with FCC Regulations and the requirements of this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement, including information related to the legal, technical and financial qualifications, and the proposed transferee's ability to operate the system in accord with this chapter and the franchise agreement. Failure to provide all information reasonably requested by the City as part of its review may be grounds for a denial of the proposed transfer. If the City fails to render a final decision on the request within 120 days after receipt by the City of all required information, such request shall be deemed granted unless the grantee and the City agree to an extension of the 120-day period. 
(d)  The consent or approval of the City to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the City in and to the rights-of-way, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement. 
(e)  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the City will not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion of construction of the proposed initial system.

(a)  Every grantee shall, to the extent required by the franchise agreement, provide institutional networks as a condition of an initial grant or renewal, or transfer of a franchise. To the extent that a grantee is obligated to provide such support pursuant to its franchise agreement, such obligation will be implemented in a competitively neutral manner, on a per subscriber basis with respect to any other franchises granted after the adoption of this chapter. Costs associated with construction and operation of an I-Net shall not be a franchise fee unless otherwise specified in the franchise agreement. 
(b)  Every grantee shall provide a channel or channels, bandwidth capacity, service, and funding for public, educational, and government ("PEG") access channels, as specified in its franchise agreement.

Sec. 8-7. - Water tap on required. 
(a)  By the authority granted in G.S. 160A-317, an eligible property shall be connected to the public water and sewer systems by the property owner within 18-months from the time service becomes available. 
(b)  For purposes of this section, the term "eligible property" shall mean (i) a developed property (ii) located within the City limits (iii) on which there is situated one or more residential dwelling units or commercial establishments that is/are located within 200 feet of and adjacent to (i.e. no easement required) any water line or sewer collection line owned, leased as lessee or operated by or on behalf of the City. Except as otherwise provided herein, the owner of such an "eligible property" shall connect the owner's premises to the water or sewer line or both. This section does not apply to undeveloped properties, industrial properties, or properties outside the municipal limits of the City (e.g. properties within the extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) of the City are exempt). 
(c)  Availability fee-Water. Pursuant to G.S. 160A-317, in lieu of requiring connection and in order to avoid hardship, the City may require the owner of an eligible property to pay a periodic availability charge for water in an amount not to exceed the minimum periodic service charge for properties that are connected. The initial availability fee shall be set by the City of Mount Airy Board of Commissioners and become effective July 01, 2015. 
(d)  Availability fee-Sewer. Pursuant to G.S. 160A-317, in lieu of requiring connection and in order to avoid hardship, the City may require the owner of an eligible property to pay a periodic availability charge for sewer in an amount not to exceed the minimum periodic service charge for properties that are connected. The initial availability fee shall be set by the City of Mount Airy Board of Commissioners and become effective July 01, 2015. 
(1)  Temporary exemption from mandatory sewer connection. Provided that, as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived: An eligible property is connected to an appropriate private sewage disposal system that has been approved by the County Health Department or the State Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources; and such privately-owned facilities are operating properly and pose no public health threat, then the eligible property shall be exempt from the mandatory connection provisions of this section for so long as the private sewer system remains in compliance. 
(2)  Determination of whether privately owned facilities are in compliance shall be at the discretion of the City Manager or his/her designee. Private systems not in compliance, including those requiring major repairs of a non-maintenance nature, shall be considered to be operating improperly, in which case the mandatory connection shall apply. 
(3)  The provisions for payment and recovery of the availability fee will apply during the period of exemption. 
(e)  Provided the service is available, no property owner shall be allowed to make a connection to a public sewer main unless a connection also is made to a public water main. 
(f)  The standard tap fee shall be charged at whatever rate is current and set by the City of Mount Airy Board of Commissioners. That said tap fee shall be paid as service is requested. 
(g)  That the City shall provide financing through the Finance Department in cases where the City Manager or his/her designee determines, in accordance with City policy, that payment of the tap fee or other City connection charges would pose a financial hardship. 
(h)  Once a property is connected to the public water or sewer line, the City no longer is authorized to charge the property owner an availability fee for the connected service(s). This is true even if there is no actual consumption at the property. Instead, the City shall assess only the periodic administrative or overhead charge (even if there is no consumption). 
(i)  The City of Mount Airy shall give notice of the initial passage of the ordinance from which this section is derived to each property owner affected by this ordinance by certified mail return receipt requested. Notice by publication or notice to owner whose name and/or address cannot be ascertained by reasonable diligence is not required. No further notice is required. 
(j)  Hardship deferral from mandatory connection. The City may grant a hardship deferral from the mandatory connection provisions of this section according to the application criteria. A deferral can be either temporary or permanent. 
(1)  A temporary deferral shall not exceed 12 months, although it may be renewed based on a re-evaluation of eligibility. 
(2)  A temporary deferral does not transfer with the sale or transfer of property, although it may be renewed based on a re-evaluation of eligibility. 
(3)  An eligible property remains subject to the requirements of this section following expiration or termination of any temporary deferral. 
(4)  During the period of deferral, whether temporary or permanent, the owner is required to pay all applicable availability fees and other charges. 
(k)  A deferral may be granted based on the following criteria: 
(1)  Applicant-based criteria. These include financial, medical or other hardship criteria related to the property owner. The City Manager shall develop eligibility criteria for a deferral under this subsection. A deferral for applicant-based criteria is personal and does not run with the land; or 
(2)  Property-related criteria. These are based on hardship conditions related to the eligible property and the work required to complete the connection(s). A deferral may be granted by the Director of Public Works based upon property-related criteria provided that the property owner produces sufficient evidence of any of the following circumstances: 
a.  Any building, although located within 200 of a municipal line, is situated such that the existing exterior connection at the building in question is in excess of 200 feet, and it is demonstrated that to relocate the exterior connection would be substantially disruptive to the property in question because of the existence of improvements or other conditions; 
b.  Any building, although located within 200 feet of a municipal line, is situated such that the effluent from the building would have to be pumped or otherwise removed from the existing building to the sewer by mechanical means; 
c.  Any building, although located within 200 feet of a municipal line, is located in such a geological area that a disturbance of the ground in running the lateral lines might substantially endanger the integrity of the building or create a health or safety hazard; 
d.  Any building, although located within 200 feet of a municipal line, is located in such an area that connection would be unreasonably technically difficult and substantial financial hardship would result; 
e.  Any building, although located within 200 feet of a municipal service line, has within the last ten years been subject to a replacement and substantial upgrade of the water or septic system on site, and the applicant can provide sufficient evidence that the system will be adequate to continue to meet the needs of the building; or 
f.  Other good cause exists for a deferral. 
(3)  A deferral may be granted in the discretion of the Director of Public Works so long as within 30 days after a property owner has been notified to connect as applicable under subsection (a) or (j) of this section (whichever date shall occur later), the property owner makes application and provides sufficient evidence for the director to make a determination under this section. A property owner may appeal to the City Manager in writing within ten days of the Director's decision. The decision of the City Manager shall be final. 
(l)  If the owner of an eligible property fails to pay an availability fee, the City may enforce this section by any of the following remedies in the discretion of the City: 
(1)  If the City provides any other public enterprise services to the property owner, it can list the availability fee on the bill for the other services and order partial payments such that the availability fee is paid first if the bill is not paid in full. This allows the unit to disconnect one or more of the other public enterprise services to the property owner for nonpayment. See G.S. 160A-314; 
(2)  If the amount owed exceeds $50.00, the City may submit the debt to the State's debt set-off program. See G.S. 105A, Art. 1. The City may institute a civil suit against the property owner to collect the debt; 
(3)  The City may impose a fine or penalty for failure to pay the amount due on time; or 
(4)  The provisions of this section may be enforced by one, all or any combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by section 1-6 of the Mount Airy Code of Ordinances as the same may be amended.

(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2013-011, § 10.2, 1-17-13) 
Sec. 8-107. - Bypass. 
(a)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
(b)  (1)  If the user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass.

a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgement to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (b) of this section. 
(2)  The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (c)(1) of this section.

b.  The cost of installing all lines within a subdivision shall be borne initially by the participating developer or developers. 
c.  Lines subject to reimbursement shall be: 
1.  Those between a subdivision and the facilities of the City and which are so located as to serve other properties; and 
2.  Lines within a subdivision, which will serve lands outside the subdivision and are of a size in excess of the needs of the subdivision itself. In this case, the cost subject to reimbursement shall be only the extra cost incurred by installing lines larger than needed to serve the subdivision itself; and 
3.  The proportionate cost of lines of any size to which direct service connections may be made by property other than those by the initial investor. 
d.  All reimbursement for cost, subsections c.1. and 2. Above, shall be made from funds appropriated by the City commissioners for this purpose. These funds may be derived from any source approved by the Board of Commissioners. 
e.  Only the actual cost of the lines shall be included in the calculations of costs subject to reimbursement. No interest on costs pending reimbursement shall be allowed. 
f.  No reimbursement of any cost shall be made after ten years from the date of acceptance by the City of the lines installed under a reimbursement agreement.

Sec. 8-150. - Other properties. 
    In accordance with the general principle that benefited property should bear the cost of extending water and sewer lines, one or more of the following methods shall be used in providing for the extension of water and sewer lines to serve properties not located within subdivisions currently under development. Properties which are annexed by the City based upon the properties meeting the necessary standards for annexation as set forth in the North Carolina General Statutes (i.e. annexation not based on a petition requesting annexation by the property owners) will have services extended to them with financing arranged by assessments as described in subsections (1)a. through g. below. 
(1)  Assessments for costs. 
a.  Lateral water and sewer main extensions will be made by assessment of the cost thereof against property owners to be benefited thereby in conformity with G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 10. In the event it is necessary or desirable to lay a water main larger than a six-inch main, or a sewer main larger than an eight-inch main, the City will bear the cost of the difference between the size of main required and a six-inch water main or eight-inch sewer main. 
b.  Lots at the intersection of streets, except lots in a subdivision which are assessed on a per lot basis as authorized by G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 10, shall be assessed as follows: 
1.  If water and sewer mains or both are installed simultaneously on both streets on which the lot abuts, assessment of the cost of the installation shall be based upon the entire frontage on one street plus the frontage on the other street in excess of 150 feet. 
2.  If such lot is already served by water or sewer mains in a street on which the lot abuts and like main is installed in the other abutting street, the cost of such new installation shall be assessed against the lot to the extent that such frontage abutting the new installation exceeds 150 feet. 
3.  If water or sewer service is installed in a street abutting a corner lot, and such service is not a duplicating service, and the method of assessment used is the street frontage method, the assessment shall not exceed the number of feet of the shortest side of said lot abutting the street. Upon installation of a duplicating service to said lot, an exemption as specified in subsection a.2. above shall be credited against the longest side of said lot abutting on the public street. 
c.  Where one or more water or sewer lines traverse a lot or tract of land and the method of assessment used is the abutting footage on the improvement, the abutting footage for each lot, tract, or parcel assessed according to the assessment roll shall not exceed the straight line distance between the beginning point and the ending point of said line or lines. However, upon the installation of a duplicating service to a traversed lot or tract of land, an exemption of 150 feet shall be allowed for the duplicating service, whether it is installed separately or simultaneously with the original service. 
d.  A lot not on a corner abutting two streets which has a water or sewer service in one street shall not be liable for an assessment for a duplicating service in the other street or streets if the subdivision of such lot or sale of any part thereof for an additional building site or sites is prohibited by the zoning or subdivision standard provisions of the City or any restrictive covenants running for a period of not less than five years from the date of the assessment for such installation. 
e.  The term "lot" as used in this section is defined as a parcel of land without regard to whether or not it is shown on any subdivision map as a separate lot and without regard to how or when acquired, except that when an assessment is made on a per lot basis in a subdivision the term "lot" shall apply to each separate subdivided lot. However, when a lot in a subdivision is already served by a water or sewer line and the lots in the subdivision are assessed on a per lot basis, the lot so served shall not be assessed a greater amount than the amount which would be assessed against the lot on a linear foot basis after giving credit for the exemptions contained in this section. 
f.  The Board of Commissioners shall determine which method of assessment authorized by G.S. § 160A-218 would be most equitable to be used in an assessment roll. 
g.  When the Board of Commissioners determines that the most equitable method of assessment is that on the basis of the frontage abutting on the project, the Council shall determine the amount of the construction cost to be borne by the abutting property owner and the amount to be borne by the City. 
(2)  Reimbursement policy. 
a.  The reimbursement policy outlined in subsection (1)b. shall be available for use by an individual property owner who desires service at some distance from existing lines and when assessment of, or contributions from, intervening property does not appear feasible. This method may also be used in financing extensions both inside and outside the City boundaries. 
b.  Extensions under any of the above financing methods may be made either by forces of the City or under contracts let by the City, or by private contracts let under the supervision of the City. 
(Ord. No. 02-01, § 1(8-132), 7-19-01) 
Sec. 8-151. - Interpretation of acreage charges. 
    The interpretation of the acreage charge policy shall be governed by the following provisions. The charge shall not apply to: 
(1)  Property which is actually tapped on to the City system and which is actually using such system, except those tapped on to the system who have entered into a reimbursement agreement with the City. 
(2)  Any other areas for which separate utility contracts have been made between the City and the developer.

(b)  In some instances it may be desirable and practical to open up a street of 30 feet right-of-way or less, especially where such width has been left for a street in an old subdivision and subsequent development limits a desirable increase in width. In such an instance, the Public Works Director and the City Manager shall make a recommendation based on a study of the street to the Board of Commissioners. 
(c)  In the case of dead-end streets, a paved turn-around radius of at least 40 feet shall be provided and a right-of-way provided for eventual elimination if this appears feasible. 
(Code 1963, § 13-18) 
Sec. 13-24. - Pavement widths. 
(a)  Pavement widths back-to-back of curb shall not be less than the following: 
(1)  Residential ..... 37 feet 
(2)  Primary business and industrial ..... 41 feet 
(b)  In some instances due to limited right-of-way, it may not be feasible to pave a street the desirable minimum width of 37 feet back-to-back of curb. In such instances, the Director of Public Works and the City Manager will study the matter and make recommendations to the Board of Commissioners. In such case, the Board of Commissioners may authorize a lesser width. 
(Code 1963, § 13-19) 
Sec. 13-25. - Intersection radii. 
    Street intersection radii shall be a minimum of 15 feet unless existing buildings or other conditions prevent such radii. 
(Code 1963, § 13-20) 
Sec. 13-26. - Grading. 
    Should it appear that sidewalks are desirable or necessary, the basic grading for the same shall be done at the same time the travel way of the street is graded and fills on one or both sides made ample for sidewalk construction later. Road banks shall be pleasingly sloped. 
(Code 1963, § 13-21) 
Sec. 13-27. - Storm drainage. 
    All materials for storm drainage to the construction limits of the street shall be furnished and installed by the developer or petitioner. The size of culverts or drainage pipe will be determined by the Public Works Department. 
(Code 1963, § 13-22) 
Sec. 13-28. - Paving standards and specifications. 
    Paving standards and specifications must comply with City standards which require standard 30 inch curb and gutter sections on both sides. In some extremely limited instances where the following criteria are met: 
(1)  Topographic conditions which create an undue hardship; 
(2)  Existing sewer and water service; 
(3)  Where a subdivision was platted and placed of record prior to the adoption of the City subdivision regulations, Chapter 14, on January 1, 1964; 
(4)  Where a subdivision, if outside the corporate limits when subdivided, was annexed other than by petition of the owner; 
(5)  Where one or more lots on other streets in the subdivision have existing homes on them; 
(6)  Where some streets in the subdivision without curb and gutter are already maintained by the City; 
It may be desirable and practical to open up a street without the requirement of curb and gutter. In such instances, the Director of Public Works and the City Manager will make recommendations based on a study of the street to the Board of Commissioners. The Board of Commissioners may, if it is deemed desirable and practical, waive the requirement of curb and gutter. 
(Code 1963, § 13-23) 
Sec. 13-29. - Completion of water and sewer installations prior to paving. 
    No street shall be paved or graveled for paving until water and sewer installations are complete except where sewer or water may be installed beyond the paving limits of the street. In areas not available to a sewer, this is not applicable.

Sec. 14-2. - Authority. 
    This chapter is hereby adopted under the authority and provisions of G.S. §§ 160A-371 through 160A-380. 
(Ord. of 8-16-84, Art. I, § 2) 
Sec. 14-3. - Jurisdiction. 
    This chapter shall govern all subdivisions of land within the corporate limits of the City, as now or hereafter established. 
(Ord. of 8-16-84, Art. I, § 3) 
Sec. 14-4. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures and standards for the development and subdivision of real estate within the corporate limits of the City, in an effort to, among other things, insure proper legal description, identification, monumentation, and recordation of real estate boundaries. Further, this chapter will promote the orderly layout and appropriate use of the land; provide safe, convenient, and economic circulation of vehicular traffic; provide suitable building sites which are readily accessible to emergency vehicles; assure the proper installation of streets and utilities; promote the eventual elimination of unsafe or unsanitary conditions arising from undue concentration of population; and help conserve and protect the physical and economic resources of the City. 
(Ord. of 8-16-84, Art. I, § 4) 
Sec. 14-5. - Compliance prerequisite to sale of lots. 
    Each individual subdivision of land within the City's planning jurisdiction shall comply with the requirements specified in this chapter before any lots may be sold. 
(Ord. of 8-16-84, Art. I, § 5) 
Sec. 14-6. - Outline of subdivision review process. 
(a)  Major subdivision review: 
Step 1. Sketch plan review. The subdivider or the subdivider's authorized representative shall submit two paper copies to the Technical Review Committee. Although this is not a formal review process, it does give both the subdivider and the governmental staff an opportunity to review the proposal. 
Step 2. Preliminary plat approval. After incorporating the points discussed in the sketch plan review step, the subdivider shall submit six paper copies of the preliminary plat to the Enforcement Officer. Submittal must be at least 14 days prior to the next regular meeting of the Planning Board. During this period, the Technical Review Committee shall determine whether or not the plat meets all the requirements of this chapter. The Planning Board, with the comments from the Technical Review Committee, shall approve, approve conditionally, or disapprove the plat within 45 days. The subdivider may appeal directly to the Board of Commissioners if such subdivider disagrees with the decision of the Planning Board, or if the Planning Board fails to act within 45 days. 
Step 3. Construction plans review. Once the preliminary plat has been approved, the subdivider may begin construction. All site improvements shall be approved by the City staff to insure they comply with municipal standards. In lieu of prior construction, the City may accept a guarantee from the subdivider that such improvements will be carried out according to local standards at such subdivider's expense. 
Step 4. Final plat approval. Within 12 months of approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall submit a final plat to the Enforcement Officer, seven days prior to the regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners. Before the Board of Commissioners acts, the Technical Review Committee shall determine whether or not the plat is basically in agreement with the preliminary plat. The Board of Commissioners shall approve or disapprove the plat within 45 days. Once the final plat has been approved, it shall be recorded with the Surry County Register of Deeds within 30 days. Only after the subdivision has been recorded may any lots be sold to the public. 
(b)  Minor subdivision plat review. In order to avoid unnecessary delays, minor subdivision plats as defined in section 14-1, may follow a shorter review process. 
Step 1. Sketch plan review. This step is the same as the one required for major subdivisions. It is simply an informal review process allowing the subdivider and the governing body to exchange information. 
Step 2. Final plat approval. After step 1 has been completed, the subdivider or the subdivider's authorized representative may prepare a final plat as specified in section 14-25, and submit it to the Technical Review Committee. This committee shall approve or disapprove this plat within ten working days. If the subdivider disagrees with its recommendation, the subdivider may appeal to the Board of Commissioners at its next regular meeting. 
(Ord. of 8-16-84) 
Sec. 14-7. - Fees. 
    Any interested person, firm or corporation requesting approval of a minor plat, preliminary plat, or final plat shall pay a fee, set by the Board of Commissioners, to defray the costs of processing, reviewing, and recording the proposed plat. Fees shall be due and payable upon submission of a plat or sketch plan. 
(Ord. of 1-7-92, § 3) 
Secs. 14-8-14-19. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCEDURE FOR MAJOR SUBDIVISION PLATS 

Sec. 14-20. - General review procedure. 
(a)  Subdivision plat review is a four stage review process. As an initial step, a developer shall prepare an informal sketch plan and have it reviewed by the Technical Review Committee which consists of senior staff members with expertise in this area. The purpose of this informal process is not to approve any plats, but to provide an opportunity to exchange information between the developer and the City. 
(b)  The formal review process begins with the preliminary plat. A plat shall be submitted in accordance with specific development standards as listed in sections 14-50 through 14-64, dealing with improvements required and minimum standards of design. Initially, the plat is reviewed by the Technical Review Committee to determine whether or not it complies with the requirements of this chapter. Once the Technical Review Committee is satisfied, the plat shall be submitted to the Planning Board. After reviewing the comments from the Technical Review Committee, the Planning Board shall approve, approve conditionally, or disapprove the plat. 
(c)  Once the preliminary plat has been approved, the subdivider may begin constructing the subdivision. Prior to any development, all constructions plans shall be approved by the City. 
(d)  Within 12 months after approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Board, the subdivider shall submit a final plat showing that such subdivider has completed the subdivision according to the preliminary plat. The final plat shall be reviewed by the Technical Review Committee and approved by the Board of Commissioners. Only after the final plat has been approved by the Board of Commissioners and recorded at the Surry County Register of Deeds office may lots be sold. The plat must be recorded within 30 days after approval by the governing body. 
(e)  In order to expedite the review process, minor subdivisions as defined in section 14-31, may complete an abbreviated review procedure. As in the full review process, the Technical Review Committee shall review informally the project to insure compliance with the general development goals of the community. Instead of then submitting a preliminary plat for review and approval, the subdivider submits only the final plat for approval by the Technical Review Committee. The subdivider, if such subdivider disagrees with the decision of the Technical Review Committee, may appeal the decision to the Board of Commissioners. 
(Ord. of 8-16-84, Art. II, § 1) 
Sec. 14-21. - Sketch design plan review. 
(a)  As stated earlier, the sketch plan review is an informal process that allows an exchange of information between the developer and the City staff. Consequently, no formal application or fee is required. It is suggested, however, that plans should be on the same size paper and scale as required for preliminary and final plats. Two paper copies shall be submitted to the Enforcement Officer. The Technical Review Committee and the developer shall review the project to evaluate its feasibility in light of the City's development practices and requirements. Once the review process has been completed, one copy shall be returned to the subdivider and one copy kept on file in the office of the Enforcement Officer. 
(b)  This review shall not in any way be construed as constituting an official action of approval for recording of the subdivision by the City. 
(Ord. of 8-16-84, Art. II, § 2) 
Sec. 14-22. - Preliminary plat review. 
(a)  Review procedure. The subdivider or the subdivider's authorized agent shall submit copies of the preliminary plat to the Enforcement Officer at least 14 days prior to a regular meeting of the Planning Board. During this period, the Technical Review Committee shall evaluate the plat to determine whether or not it meets the requirements of this chapter. The Technical Review Committee may receive comments from other persons or agencies before making its final recommendations. After the Technical Review Committee determines that the plat meets the requirements of this chapter, it shall be submitted to the Planning Board for approval. This body shall approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the plat within 45 days after first consideration by it. When the Planning Board fails to act within the 45 day period, the subdivider may appeal directly to the Board of Commissioners. If the preliminary plat is not submitted to the Enforcement Officer at least 14 days prior to the regular meeting of the Planning Board, the Technical Review Committee will not have sufficient time to review the proposal, so the plat will not be submitted to the Planning Board until its next regular meeting. 
(b)  Number of copies and graphic media. Six black or blueline prints of the proposed subdivision shall be submitted. 
(c)  Scale and size of sheets. The preliminary plat shall be at a scale of one inch to 100 feet and be drawn on a sheet with an outside dimension of not more than 18 inches by 24 inches and shall include a one-half inch border on each side. 
(d)  Authorized preparer of plats. The preliminary plat shall be prepared by a surveyor licensed and registered to practice in the State. 
(e)  Reserved. 
(f)  Certification required. The Technical Review Committee shall evaluate the preliminary plat to determine whether or not it meets the requirements of this chapter. The Technical Review Committee shall certify that the preliminary plat meets the requirements of this chapter. 
(1)  This certification shall be indicated on all copies submitted to the Planning Board. It shall read as follows:

Preliminary Plat 
(h)  Disposition of copies. If the preliminary plat is approved or approved conditionally, approval and conditions shall be noted on at least three copies of the plat by the Planning Board Chairman. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider, one copy shall be retained by the Public Works Department, and one copy shall be retained by the Enforcement Officer. If the preliminary plat is disapproved, the Planning Board shall specify the reasons for such action in writing. One copy of such reasons shall be returned to the subdivider and one copy retained by the Enforcement Officer. If the preliminary plat is disapproved, the subdivider may make the recommended changes and submit a revised preliminary plat to the Enforcement Officer. 
(Ord. of 8-16-84, Art. II, § 3; Ord. of 1-7-92, § 4) 
Sec. 14-23. - Improvement plans approved prior to construction. 
    All site improvements shall be in accordance with the City standards. Before a final plat is eligible for approval by the Board of Commissioners, all improvements shall be installed or guarantees approved as specified in section 14-24. All plans and specifications for site improvements, including but not limited to, grading, drainage, sidewalks, utilities (water and sewer), and street improvements shall be inspected and approved by the City prior to construction. 
(Ord. of 8-16-84, Art. II, § 4) 
Sec. 14-24. - Performance guarantees. 
(a)  In lieu of prior construction of the improvements required by this chapter the City may, for the purpose of approving a final plat, accept a guarantee from the subdivider that such improvements will be carried out according to the City's specifications at the subdivider's expense. Types of guarantees include: 
(1)  A surety bond made by a surety company licensed to do business in the State. 
(2)  A certified check drawn in favor of the City. 
(3)  Cash deposited with the City. 
(4)  An irrevocable letter of credit. 
(b)  Such guarantee shall be in an amount of 110 percent of the estimated cost of the required improvements. Performance guarantees shall be approved by the City Manager; the guarantees may be renegotiated after the six month period expires to reflect changes in estimated development costs. 
(Ord. of 8-16-84, Art. II, § 5) 
Sec. 14-25. - Final plat. 
(a)  Review procedure. The subdivider or the subdivider's authorized agent shall submit copies of the final plat to the Enforcement Officer at least seven days prior to a regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners. During this seven day period, the Technical Review Committee shall determine whether or not the final plat substantially agrees with the approved preliminary plat. If substantial differences exist, the plat shall be resubmitted as a new preliminary plat. After receiving a correct plat, the Board of Commissioners shall approve or disapprove the final plat within 45 days after first consideration. 
(b)  Certifications required from subdivider. Before the Enforcement Officer shall accept a final plat, the following certifications shall appear on all seven copies:

ARTICLE III. - REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCEDURE FOR MINOR AND FAMILY SUBDIVISION PLATS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2015-028, adopted May 21, 2015, amended article III in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article III, §§ 14-30-14-35, pertained to review and approval procedure for minor subdivision plats, and derived from an ordiancne of August 16, 1984. 

Sec. 14-30. - Objective. 
    An abbreviated process shall be permitted to simplify and speed up the review procedure for handling minor subdivision and family subdivision plats without undermining the objectives of the subdivision regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2015-28, 5-21-15) 
Sec. 14-31. - Minor subdivision defined. 
    A minor subdivision shall include all subdivisions that: 
(1)  Front on a publicly maintained street; and 
(2)  Create five lots or less. 
(Ord. No. 2015-28, 5-21-15) 
Sec. 14-32. - Family subdivision defined. 
    A family subdivision shall include all subdivisions that: 
(1)  Have access to a publicly maintained street by way of a private street with a minimum right-of-way width of 45 feet; and 
(2)  Create five lots or less conveyed by the property owner(s) to a family member (father, mother, brother, sister, son, daughter, grandfather, grandmother, grandson, granddaughter, nephew, or niece). 
(Ord. No. 2015-28, 5-21-15) 
Sec. 14-33. - Procedure. 
(a)  The developer shall submit a sketch development plan to the Technical Review Committee. At this stage the City staff and the developer shall informally review the proposal. Normally this step can be completed in one day. 
(b)  After this initial review has been completed, the subdivider or the subdivider's authorized representative shall prepare a final plat as specified in section 14-25 and submit it to the Technical Review Committee. 
(c)  The Technical Review Committee shall approve or disapprove the final plat within ten working days. If the subdivider disagrees with the decision of the Technical Review Committee or does not receive a response within ten working days, the subdivider may appeal to the Board of Commissioners at its next regular meeting. 
(d)  For family subdivisions, a notarized document provided by the Planning and Development Department shall be submitted with the final plat to the Technical Review Committee to ensure family lineage as defined in section 14-32(2). 
(Ord. No. 2015-28, 5-21-15) 
Sec. 14-34. - Certification. 
    In the abbreviated procedure, the certifications for the final plat shall be the same as required in the normal review procedure as specified in subsection (a) of section 14-25. The only difference is that the final certification of approval shall come from the Technical Review Committee, not the Board of Commissioners. The only exception to this rule would occur if the subdivider appealed to the Board of Commissioners and it overruled the decision of the Technical Review Committee. The certification of approval shall appear on the original mylar and three copies and read as follows: 
"CERTIFICATION OF APPROVAL BY THE MOUNT AIRY 
TECHNICAL REVIEW COMMITTEE (TRC)" 
The Mount Airy Technical Review Committee hereby approved the final plat for the _______ Subdivision, provided this plat is recorded with the Surry County Register of Deeds within 30 days. 
_____
Date _____
Subdivision Administrator, Mount Airy, North Carolina"  
    For approved family subdivisions, a private street disclosure statement shall appear on the original mylar and three copies and read as follows: 
"FAMILY SUBDIVISION PRIVATE STREET DISCLOSURE STATEMENT" 
"The private streets and roadways shown hereon are dedicated to the private use of lots within the approved family subdivision. There is no intention by recordation of the subdivision plat to dedicate the streets and roadways therein to public use. The responsibility for improvements and maintenance of such streets and roadways shall be for the abutting lot owners and their successors in interest. There is no commitment by the City of Mount Airy, North Carolina Department of Transportation, or any other governmental body to assume responsibility for maintenance." 
(Ord. No. 2015-28, 5-21-15) 
Sec. 14-35. - Preliminary and final plat requirements. 
    Minor and family subdivision plats shall comply with the same requirements as regular subdivisions as specified in sections 14-22 through 14-26. 
(Ord. No. 2015-28, 5-21-15) 
Sec. 14-36. - Appeal procedure. 
    If the subdivider disagrees with the decision of the Technical Review Committee or does not receive a response within ten working days, the subdivider may appeal to the Board of Commissioners at its next regular meeting.

However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall govern. 
(Ord. of 8-16-84, Art. VII, § 7) 
Sec. 14-75. - Penalties for violation. 
    Any person who, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land located within the territorial jurisdiction of this chapter, thereafter subdivides such person's land in violation of this chapter or transfers or sells land by reference to, exhibition of, or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land before the plat has been properly approved under the terms of this chapter and recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds of the County, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. The descriptions by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring land shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty.

Such determination shall be within the discretion of the Zoning Administrator. In those situations wherein screening will not serve the intended purpose of this Section, due to the particular terrain or structural features of the subject or adjacent property, no open storage shall be permitted. 
    Under the conditions set out above, this section is intended to permit open storage of goods, material and equipment intended for wholesale sales. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the open storage of any waste, residue, salvage or junk materials in any quantity or any other materials or substances which are or are likely to become detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of this zoning district or of the community.

State Law reference- Zoning districts, G.S. § 160A-382. 

Sec. 4.1 - Primary Zoning Districts Established; Purposes Set Forth. 
    For the purposes of this Ordinance, the City of Mount Airy, North Carolina and its area of extraterritorial jurisdiction, is hereby divided into the following primary use districts: 
Section 4.1.1 R-20 Residential District. 
The R-20 Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of the land is for low density residential or agricultural uses. The R-20 district also permits associated public and private facilities typically associated with such districts. 
Section 4.1.2 R-15 Single-Family Residential District. 
The R-15 Single-Family Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for medium density single-family residential uses and associated public and private facilities typically associated with such districts. 
Section 4.1.3 R-8 Single-Family Residential District. 
The R-8 Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family residential purposes. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas for those persons desiring single-family residences. 
Section 4.1.4 R-6 General Residential District. 
The R-6 Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family, two-family and multi-family residences. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas in the community for those persons desiring small residences and multi-family structures in relatively high density neighborhoods. 
Section 4.1.5 R-4 Residential and Office District. 
The R-4 Residential and Office District is established to provide for the high density residential, office, governmental and institutional needs of the community. It functions as a transitional land use between intensive commercial and industrial uses, and residential development. The district is also designed to encourage compatible uses along major thoroughfares adjacent to residential neighborhoods. 
Section 4.1.6 B-1 Central Business District. 
This district is the central shopping area of the City of Mount Airy and its surrounding commercial trade area. The regulations of this district are designed to encourage the continued use of land for community trade and commercial service uses and to promote a concentrated development of permitted uses while maintaining a substantial relationship between the intensity of land uses and the capacity of utilities and streets. 
Section 4.1.7 B-2 General Business District. 
This district provides a location for those businesses and services which generally serve a wider area than the neighborhood business, but do not necessarily require location in the central business district. Because these commercial uses are important to the economy of the area and are subject to public view, they should have ample parking, controlled traffic movement, and suitable site design. 
Section 4.1.8 B-3 Neighborhood Business District. 
The B-3 Neighborhood Business District is intended for the use of those businesses which are properly and necessarily located near residential areas and which cater to the everyday needs of a residential neighborhood. 
Section 4.1.9 B-4 Highway Business District. 
The B-4 Highway Business Districts are generally located on major thoroughfares and collector streets in the Mount Airy Planning area. Because these business areas are subject to the public view. They should provide an appropriate appearance, ample parking, and be designed to minimize traffic congestion. 
Section 4.1.10 B-5 Medical Business District. 
The regulations for this district are designed to permit concentrated development of business and professional office facilities within the jurisdiction and to encourage development that is compatible with nearby residential areas that is not hazardous to safe vehicular and pedestrian traffic. 
Section 4.1.11 M-1 Industrial District. 
The M-1 Industrial District is established for those areas of the community where the principal use of land is for industrial and warehousing uses. These uses, by their nature, may create some nuisance and are not properly associated with residential, commercial or service establishments. These uses normally seek outlying locations on large tracts of land where the operations involved do not detract from the development potential of nearby undeveloped properties. 
Sec. 4.2. - Conditional Districts Established; Purposes Set Forth. 
    There is also established a Conditional District (CD) which corresponds to each of the districts authorized by this Ordinance as follows: 
R-20 - CD R-6 - CD B-2 - CD B-5 - CD R-15 - CD R-4 - CD B-3 - CD M-1 - CD R-8 - CD B-1 - CD B-4 - CD  
    The purpose of the conditional district rezoning process is to provide a procedure for considering the rezoning of property based upon the recognition that certain types of zoning would be inappropriate at particular locations in the absence of special conditions. Because of the refinement of this option, the City strongly encourages its use for such situations. Conditional district zoning affords a degree of certainty when making land use decisions that are not possible when rezoning to a general zoning district, which allows the full range of uses permitted in the district and does not provide the flexibility to propose or require binding site specific conditions to address unique issues that affect the subject property or any potential adverse impacts on adjacent property. 
(Ord. No. 2015-025, 4-16-15) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2015-025, adopted April 16, 2015, amended § 4.2 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former § 4.2, pertained to conditional use districts established; purposes set forth. 
Sec. 4.3. - Overlay Districts Established; Purposes Set Forth. 
    The Primary Zoning Districts established in Section 4.1 and the Conditional Districts established in Section 4.2 may also be subject to the additional requirements of one or more Overlay District as established herein. 
Section 4.3.1 Flood Damage Prevention Overlay District. 
The flood hazard areas of the jurisdiction are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and government services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
It is the purpose of this Overlay District to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and, 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
The Flood Damage Prevention Overlay District is established as the Floodway and Floodway Fringe areas of the various water courses within the jurisdiction as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on its latest flood maps with accompanying supporting data which are hereby adopted by reference. 
Section 4.3.2 Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay District. 
The Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay Districts are intended to help preserve and maintain the City's outstanding water resources. They are established to protect those portions of designated water supply watersheds which lie closest to existing and proposed water supply intakes from activities which could degrade water quality; to reduce the amount of sediment washing into streams; to encourage a low intensity of land development in the most sensitive portions of the watershed; to reduce the risk to water quality posed by high density residential and non-residential developments; and for the purpose of protecting and promoting public health, safety, and the general welfare of the jurisdiction. 
The following Watershed Protection Overlay District classifications are established and are shown on the Watershed Protection Overlay District Map which is hereby adopted and incorporated into this Ordinance. 
Ararat River Watershed Critical Area (ARWS-CA)-WS-III-CA* 
Ararat River Watershed Protected Area (ARWS-PA)-WS-IV-PA* 
Lovills Creek Watershed Critical Area (LCWS-CA)-WS-IV-CA* 
Lovills Creek Watershed Protected Area (LCWS-PA)-WS-IV-PA* 
Stewarts Creek Watershed Critical Area (SCWS-CA)-WS-IV-CA* 
Stewarts Creek Watershed Protected Area (SCWS-PA)-WS-IV-PA* 
* Water Supply Watershed classification as assigned to the Water Supply Watershed by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission pursuant to G.S. § 143-214.5. 
Section 4.3.3 Historic Landmarks and Preservation Overlay District. 
The Mount Airy Historic Landmarks and Preservation Overlay Districts are among the most valued and important assets of Mount Airy. They are established for the purpose of protecting and conserving the heritage of the City of Mount Airy and the State; for the purpose of safeguarding the character and heritage of the landmarks and districts by preserving the districts as a whole and any individual property that embodies important elements of social, economic, cultural, political or architectural history; for the purpose of promoting the conservation of such landmarks and districts for the education, pleasure and enrichment of residents of the City of Mount Airy and the State as a whole; for the purpose of fostering civic beauty; and for the purpose of stabilizing and enhancing property values, thus contributing to the improvement of the general health and welfare of the City of Mount Airy and the residents of the landmarks and districts. 
Historic Landmarks and Preservation Overlay Districts are hereby established as a series of areas which overlap and overlay existing zoning districts, the extent and boundaries of which are as indicated in the Official Zoning Map and which is hereby adopted and made a part of this Ordinance. 
No property or area shall be recommended for designation as a landmark or district unless it is deemed and found by the Historic Preservation Commission to be of special significance in terms of its historical, prehistorical, architectural or cultural importance and to possess integrity of design, setting, workmanship, materials, feeling and/or association. 
The Historic Preservation Commission shall make or cause to be made an investigation and report on the historic, architectural, prehistorical, educational or cultural significance of each building, structure, site, area or object proposed for designation or acquisition. Such investigation or report shall be forwarded to the State Historic Preservation Office, North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources. 
The Department of Cultural Resources, acting through the State Historic Preservation Office shall either upon request of the Department or at the initiative of the Historic Preservation Commission be given an opportunity to review and comment upon the substance and effect of the designation of any landmark or district pursuant to this part. Any comments shall be provided in writing. If the Department does not submit its comments or recommendation in connection with any designation within 30 days following receipt by the Department of the investigation and report of the Commission, the Commission and the City Board shall be relieved of any responsibility to consider such comments. 
The Historic Preservation Commission and the City Board shall hold a joint public hearing or separate public hearings on the proposed ordinance. Reasonable notice of the time and place thereof shall be given. All meetings of the Commission shall be open to the public in accordance with the North Carolina Open Meetings Law. 
Following the joint public hearing or separate public hearings, the City may adopt the ordinance as proposed, adopt the ordinance with any amendments it deems necessary, or reject the proposed ordinance. 
Upon adoption of the ordinance, the owners and occupants of each designated landmark or overlay district shall be given written notification of the ordinance and all amendments thereto shall be filed by the Historic Preservation Commission in the office of the Register of Deeds and the copy shall be made available for public inspection at any reasonable time. Each designated landmark or district shall be indexed according to the name of the owner of the property in the grantee and grantor indexes in the Register of Deeds office. A second copy of the ordinance and all amendments thereto shall be given to the building inspector. The fact that a building, structure, site, area or object has been designated a landmark or district shall be clearly indicated on all tax maps maintained by the City for such period as the designation remains in effect. 
Upon the adoption of the landmark or district ordinance or any amendment thereto, it shall be the duty of the Historic Preservation Commission to give notice thereof to the tax supervisor. The designation and any recorded restrictions upon the property limiting its use for preservation purposes shall be considered by the tax supervisor appraising it for tax purposes. 
Section 4.3.3.1 Designation of Historic Districts and Landmarks. 
A.  Designation of Historic Districts. 
Mount Airy Historic Districts are established by the City after action has been proposed by a neighborhood organization, a preservation group, or the City, and after careful research and evaluation. Historic district designation is designed to protect and enhance the existing character of a community. Through historic district overlay zoning, a neighborhood is protected from unmanaged change by a review process based on established design guidelines. The following process will be followed for designating historic districts: 
(1)  An area within the City will be nominated to be part of the Mount Airy Historic District. Nominations can come from the Historic Preservation Commission, the City of Mount Airy, neighborhoods, and individual citizens within an area. 
(2)  The area must be of special significance in terms of history, prehistory, architecture, and/or culture and to possess integrity of design, setting, materials, feeling, and association. An investigation and report describing the significance of the buildings, structures, features, sites or surroundings included in any proposed district. 
(3)  A description of the boundaries of such district must be prepared. 
(4)  The proposed district must be submitted to the Department of Cultural Resources, acting through the State Historic Preservation Office. The State Historic Preservation Office shall provide an analysis of and recommendations concerning such report and description of proposed boundaries. The State Historic Preservation Office shall submit its written analysis and recommendations to the municipal governing board within thirty (30) calendar days after a written request has been received. If the written analysis is not received within thirty (30) days of receipt, the municipality is relieved of its responsibility to await such analysis and the City may adopt or amend its zoning ordinance. 
(5)  The Historic Preservation Commission will review the boundaries, significance and guidance received from the State Historic Preservation Office and make recommendations to the municipality regarding the proposed district. The Historic Preservation Commission is the only body authorized to propose local designation to the governing board. 
B.  Designation of Historic Landmarks. 
A property shall be recommended for designation as a historic landmark if it is deemed and found by the Historic Preservation Commission to be of special significance in terms of its historical, prehistorical, architectural, or cultural importance, and to possess integrity of design, setting, workmanship, materials, feeling and/or association. 
The Historic Preservation Commission shall keep a listing of designated historic landmarks describing each property by name, the names of the owners of the property, the elements of the property that are integral to its historical, architectural, or prehistorical value, including the land area of the property so designated, and any other information the governing board deems necessary. 
The following process will be followed for designating historic landmarks: 
(1)  The Commission shall undertake an inventory of properties of historical, architectural, prehistorical, and cultural significance within its jurisdiction (it an inventory has not already taken place). 
(2)  Once properties are identified, the Commission shall receive nominations for historic landmarks from the Commission members, the City, and property owners. The nomination period runs and is open for the entire year. 
(3)  Once nominations are received, the Commission will review nominations and review properties for compliance with Historic Preservation standards and landmark guidelines. The nominations will be forwarded to the State Historic Preservation Office, North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources. 
(4)  At a future Historic Preservation Commission Meeting following the receipt of guidance from the State Historic Preservation Office, a public hearing shall be held, which is open to the public and in accordance with the North Carolina Open Meetings Law, Chapter 143, Article 33C. Following the public hearing, the Commission shall approve or deny properties to be recommended as historic landmarks. 
(5)  Upon denial of historic landmarks, owners of subject properties shall be given written notification of such designation insofar as reasonable diligence permits. 
(6)  If approved to be recommended as a historic landmark, the Commission will forward the recommendation as required by City Code to the Board of Commissioners for approval. The Historic Preservation Commission is the only body authorized to propose local designation to the governing board. 
(7)  Each designated landmark shall be indexed according to the name of the owner of the property in the grantee and grantor indexes in the register of deeds office. The Commission shall require the property owner of record to pay a reasonable fee for filing and indexing. 
(8)  The fact that a building, structure, site, area or object has been designated a landmark shall be clearly indicated on all tax maps maintained by the County or City for such period as the designation remains in effect. 
(9)  Upon adoption of a property as a historic landmark, it shall be the duty of the Commission to give notice thereof to the tax supervisor of the county in which the property is located. The designation and any recorded restrictions up on the property limiting its use for preservation purposes shall be considered by the tax supervisor in appraising it for tax purposes. 
(10)  For each designated landmark, a suitable sign on the property indicating that the property has been so designated shall be placed by the owner on the property or on a nearby public right-of-way. The sign must be approved by the Commission.

Sec. 4.4. - District Boundaries Shown on Zoning Map. 
    The boundaries of the districts are shown on the map accompanying this Ordinance and made a part hereof entitled "Official Zoning Map, Mount Airy, North Carolina". The Zoning Map and all the notations, references and amendments thereto, and other information shown thereon are hereby made a part of this Ordinance the same as if such information set forth on the map were all fully described as set out herein. The Zoning Map is posted at the Municipal Building and is available for inspection by the public. 
Sec. 4.5. - Rules Governing Boundaries. 
    Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts as shown on the official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply: 
A.  As property boundaries and rights often extend into and within rights of ways, district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets or highways, street or railroad right-of-way lines or such lines extended, such center lines, street or railroad right-of-way lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
B.  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow platted lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries. 
C.  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the center lines of streets, highways, or railroads, or right-of-way of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the Zoning Map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by use of the scale shown on said Zoning Map. 
D.  Where any street or alley is hereafter officially closed, vacated or abandoned, the zoning district adjoining each side of the street or alley shall be automatically extended to the center of the street or alley, and all lands which are included in the closed portion shall thereafter be subject to the regulations of the extended districts. 
E.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following City limit lines shall be construed to follow such City limit lines. 
F.  Where district boundaries are indicated as following topographic contours, drainage divides or specific measured distances such features shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
G.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
H.  Distances not specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the scale of the map. 
I.  Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the Official Zoning Map, or if further uncertainty exists as to the location of boundaries or applicability of zoning districts, the Board of Adjustment shall interpret the intent of the Zoning Map as to the location of such boundaries, and the applicability of such districts. 
(Ord. No. 2015-026, 4-16-15) 
Sec. 4.6. - Determining Permitted and Conditional Uses, Principal Uses and Mixed Uses. 
    The listings of Permitted and Conditional Uses in the various Districts in this Ordinance are considered to be specific in regard to the types of uses intended for each of the various Districts. In determining proposed uses, the Zoning Administrator shall classify the form and function of the use. When a proposed use is not specifically listed in the Table of Permitted and Conditional Uses, the Zoning Administrator shall determine if the use is the same as, or manifestly similar to, a listed use in form and function. If the Zoning Administrator finds that the proposed use is the same as, or manifestly similar to, a listed use, he shall classify the proposed use as the listed use. In doing so the Zoning Administrator may consult the North American Industry Classification System published by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. If the Zoning Administrator finds that a proposed use is not the same as, or is not manifestly similar to, a listed use, he shall classify the proposed use as not permitted. 
    In determining what is a principal use, the principal use shall be considered as the primary purpose or function that a lot or structure serves or is proposed to serve. An accessory use shall be considered a structure or use that: 
(1)  Is clearly incidental to and customarily found in connection with a principal building or use; 
(2)  Is subordinate to and serves a principal building or a principal use; 
(3)  Is subordinate in area, extent, or purpose to the principal building or principal use served; 
(4)  Contributes to the comfort, convenience, or necessity of occupants, business, or industry in the principal building or principal use served; and 
(5)  Is located on the same lot and zoned the same as the principal building or use served. 
    Two or more principal uses may, in some cases, be permitted to occupy the same land or building as long as each use is a permitted use.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2015-025, adopted April 16, 2015, amended § 5.2 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former § 5.2, pertained to conditional use district requirements. 
Sec. 5.3. - Overlay District Requirements. 
    In addition to the standards and requirements of the underlying Principal or Conditional District, Overlay Districts shall comply with the following requirements: 
Section 5.3.1 Flood Damage Prevention Overlay District. 
Section 5.3.1.1 Objectives of the Flood Damage Prevention Overlay District. 
The objectives of this Section are to: 
  Protect human life and health; 
  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
  Ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
Section 5.3.1.2 Lands to Which This Article Applies. 
This Section shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance. 
Section 5.3.1.3 Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. 
The Special Flood Hazard Areas are those identified under the Cooperating Technical State (CTS) agreement between the State of North Carolina and FEMA in its Flood Insurance Study dated November 18, 2016 for Surry County and associated FIRM panels, including any digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study, which are adopted by reference and declared a part of this ordinance. Future revisions to the FIS and FIRM panels that do not change flood hazard data within the jurisdictional authority of Mount Airy are also adopted by reference and declared a part of this ordinance. Subsequent revisions to the FIRM should be adopted within 3 months. 
Section 5.3.1.4 Compliance With This Ordinance. 
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this Section and other applicable regulations. 
Section 5.3.1.5 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by this Section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This Section does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Section shall not create liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Section or any administrative decision made pursuant to this Section. 
Section 5.3.1.6 Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction 
In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
  New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
  New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
  New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;

  Nonconforming buildings or uses may not be enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in conformance with the provisions of this Section and Article 11 of this Ordinance. Provided, however, nothing in this Section shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of this Section and located totally or partially within the floodway zone, provided that the bulk of the building or structure below base flood elevation in the floodway zone is not increased and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this Section. 
Section 5.3.1.7 Specific Standards for Construction of Permanent Structures. 
Section 5.3.1.7.1 Residential Construction. 
New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided. A registered professional engineer or land surveyor shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. 
Section 5.3.1.7.2 Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites (i) outside a manufactured home park or subdivision; (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or, (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
Section 5.3.1.7.3 The following shall apply to Manufactured homes only: 
  Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject to the provisions of § 4.14.18.2 shall be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement in accordance with the Regulations for Mobile Homes and Modular Housing adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 43-143.15. Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis at least 36 inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in height an engineering certification is required. 
Section 5.3.1.7.4 Nonresidential Construction. 
New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation. Structures located in all A zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. 
Section 5.3.1.8 Elevated Buildings. 
New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms, except to enclose storage rooms. 
Section 5.3.1.9 Temporary Structures. 
Prior to the issuance of a development permit for a temporary structure, the following requirements must be met: 
  All applicants must submit to the Administrator prior to the issuance of the development permit a plan for the removal of such structure(s) in the event of a hurricane or flash flood warning notification. The plan must include the following information: 
  A specified time period for which the temporary use will be permitted;

Section 5.3.2 Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay District. 
Section 5.3.2.1 General Provisions. 
The following general provisions apply to all Watershed Overlay Districts. These provisions and the provisions contained in the Individual Watershed Overlay Districts are designed to protect the water quality of the Water Supply Watersheds that lie within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance and to implement the rules adopted by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commissions for the classified watersheds pursuant to G.S. § 143-214.5. 
A.  The construction of new roads and bridges and non-residential development should minimize built-upon area, divert stormwater away from surface water supply waters as much as possible, and employ best management practices (BMPs) to minimize water quality impacts. To the extent practicable, the construction of new roads in the critical area should be avoided. The Department of Transportation BMPs as outlined in their document entitled "Best Management Practices for the Protection of Surface Waters" shall be used in all road and bridge construction projects in the watershed Overlay Districts. 
B.  All development activities within Watershed Overlay Districts, in addition to those activities specifically regulated by these provisions, are subject to the standards, usage conditions and other regulations contained in the Rules and Requirements of the Surface Water Supply Protection Rules adopted by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission. 
C.  A minimum 30-foot vegetative buffer for development activities is required along all perennial waters, including streams, rivers and impoundments, indicated on the most recent versions of United States Geodetic Survey (USGS) 1: 24,000 scale topographic maps; provided, that nothing in this Subsection shall prevent artificial streambank or shoreline stabilization. No new development is allowed in the buffer, except that water dependent structures, or other structures such as flagpoles, signs, and security lights, which result in only diminimus increase in impervious area and public works projects such as road crossings and greenways may be allowed where no practicable alternative exists. These activities shall minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from the surface water, and maximize the utilization of BMPs. 
D.  Where otherwise permitted in the underlying Primary Zoning District, Cluster Development is allowed on a project by project basis as follows: 
(1)  The overall density of the project meets the density requirements of this Ordinance; 
(2)  The appropriate vegetative buffer in (C) above is provided; 
(3)  Built upon areas are designed and located to minimize stormwater runoff impact to the receiving waters, minimize concentrated stormwater flow, and maximize the flow length through vegetated areas; 
(4)  Areas of concentrated development are located in upland areas and away, to the maximum extent practicable, from surface waters and drainage ways; 
(5)  Remainder of tract to remain in vegetated or natural state; 
(6)  The area in the vegetated or natural state may be conveyed to a property owners association; a local government for preservation as a park or greenway; a conservation organization; or placed in a permanent conservation or farmland preservation easement. A maintenance agreement shall be filed with the property deeds; and 
(7)  Cluster development shall transport stormwater runoff from the development by vegetated conveyances to the maximum extent practicable. 
E.  All development in Watershed Overlay Districts, shall, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize built-upon surface area, direct stormwater runoff away from surface waters and incorporate best management practices to minimize water quality impacts. 
F.  Existing development, as defined in this Ordinance, is not subject to the requirements of the overlay provisions. Expansions to structures classified as existing development must meet the requirements of these provisions, provided however, the built-upon area of the existing development is not required to be included in the density calculations. In determining expansions to existing development, the maximum permitted additional built-upon area is derived by multiplying the area of the portion of the property that is not built-upon by the appropriate percent built-upon limitation for the Overlay District in which the property is located. 
G.  A pre-existing lot created prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, regardless of whether or not a vested right has been established, may be developed or redeveloped for single family residential purposes without being subject to the restrictions of these overlay provisions. 
H.  Any existing building or built-upon area not in conformance with the limitations of these provisions that has been damaged or removed for any reason may be repaired and/or reconstructed, provided: 
(1)  Repair or reconstruction is initiated within twelve (12) months and completed within two (2) years of such damage or removal. 
(2)  The total amount of space devoted to built-upon area may not be increased. 
(3)  The repair or reconstruction is otherwise permitted under the provisions of this Ordinance. 
I.  No activity, situation, structure or land use shall be permitted or allowed to operate within a watershed which poses a threat to water quality and the public health, safety and welfare. 
Such conditions may arise from inadequate on-site sewage systems which utilize ground absorption; inadequate sedimentation and erosion control measures; the improper storage or disposal of junk, trash or other refuse within a buffer area; the absence or improper implementation of a spill containment plan for toxic and hazardous materials; the improper management of stormwater runoff; or any other situation found to pose a threat to water quality. 
J.  The Zoning Administrator may require such information on Zoning Compliance Permit and Development Plan applications, including density/built-upon area calculations, as he may deem necessary to determine compliance with Watershed Overlay District provisions. 
K.  The Zoning Administrator may, prior to the issuance of any permit in a Watershed Overlay District, require evidence of a valid Sedimentation Control Permit issued by the State of North Carolina or evidence satisfactory to the Administrator that no permit is required. 
L.  The Zoning Administrator shall maintain records of the administration of the Watershed Overlay District regulations and shall submit any modifications of the regulations to the Division of Environmental Management, Division of Environmental Health and Division of Community Assistance. The Zoning Administrator shall also maintain a record of variances issued and shall submit an annual report of each project receiving a variance and the reason for the variance to the Division of Environmental Management. The annual report shall contain the record of each variance granted by the Board of Adjustment during the previous calendar year and shall be submitted on or before January 1 of the following year.

The following development standards shall apply in the protected areas of the Ararat River Watershed, the Lovills Creek Watershed and the Stewarts Creek Watershed: 
A.  Residential development activities which require a Sedimentation Control Permit shall not exceed one (1) dwelling unit per 20,000 square feet or, optionally, twenty-four percent (24%) built-upon area, on a project by project basis. 
B.  Non-residential development activities which require a Sedimentation Control Permit shall not exceed twenty-four percent (24%) built-upon area, on a project by project basis. 
C.  Residential development activities which require a Sedimentation Control Permit and which are not required to use, or do not utilize a curb and gutter street system, shall not exceed three (3) dwelling units per acre or, optionally, thirty-six percent (36%) built-upon area, on a project by project basis. 
D.  Non-residential development activities which require a Sedimentation Control Permit and which are not required to use, or which do not utilize a curb and gutter street system, shall not exceed thirty-six percent (36%) built-upon area, on a project by project basis. 
E.  Notwithstanding the limitations of 5.3.2.3 A, B, C and D above, 10% of the protected area of each of the watersheds may be developed with new development projects of up to seventy percent (70%) built-upon area as Special Intensity Allocations (SIAs). SIAs shall be allocated and developed in accordance with the following rules: 
(1)  SIA's shall be allocated by the Zoning Administrator through the Zoning Permit/Development Plan process. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a record of the total acreage in each protected area eligible for SIAs, the acreage that has been allocated and the acreage that has been used as of the latest date. In no case shall allocated acreage exceed the acreage eligible for allocation. For the purpose of this subsection, the total area that can be allocated for SIA's in the protected areas is as follows: 
a)  Ararat River Protected Area - 62 acres; 
b)  Lovills Creek Protected Area - 147 acres; 
c)  Stewarts Creek Protected Area - 121 acres. 
(2)  SIA's shall be allocated on a "first come, first served" basis upon the approval and issuance of the appropriate permit. 
(3)  The right to develop a SIA shall terminate with the loss of the right to develop due to the expiration of a Zoning Permit, Zoning Permit with Vested Rights, or Building Permit. In such a case, the allocated acreage, or unused allocated acreage, shall be returned to the unallocated total acreage eligible for allocation. 
(4)  In no case shall the built-upon area of a SIA exceed the built-upon limitations of the Primary Zoning District in which the SIA is located.

Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural features in Historic Districts or Landmarks which does not involve a change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature which the Building Inspector or similar official shall certify in writing to the Commission is required by the need to protect the public health and safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinance, or regulations. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent (1) the maintenance or (2) in the event of an emergency, the immediate restoration of any existing above-ground utility structure without approval by the Commission. 
Section 5.3.3.4 Demolition of Buildings. 
Except for buildings or structures of statewide significance, an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness authorizing the demolition or relocation of a building or structure within the districts may not be denied. However, the effective date of such a certificate may be delayed for a period of up to 365 days from the date of approval. The maximum period of delay authorized by this section shall be reduced by the Commission where it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from such property by virtue of the delay. During such period, the Historic Preservation Commission or its agent may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building. If the Historic Preservation Commission finds that the building has no particular significance or value toward maintaining the character of the district, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal. 
An application for a Certificate of Appropriateness authorizing the demolition or destruction of a building, site, or structure determined by the State Historic Preservation Office as having statewide significance as defined in the criteria of the National Register of Historic Places may be denied except where the Commission finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use or return by virtue of the denial. 
In the event that the Commission has voted to recommend designation of a property as a landmark, or of an area as a district, and such designation has not yet been made by the City, the demolition of any building, site, object, area, or structure located on the property of the proposed landmark or within the proposed district may be delayed by the Commission for a period of up to 180 calendar days or until the City takes final action on the proposed designation, whichever occurs first. Should the City approve the designation prior to the expiration of the 180 day delay period, an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness authorizing demolition must then be filed; however, the maximum delay period of 180 days shall be reduced by the number of days elapsed during the 180 day delay while designation was pending. 
Section 5.3.3.5 Site Visits. 
As part of its review procedure, the Commission may view the premises and seek the advice of the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources or such other expert advice as it may deem necessary under the circumstances. 
Section 5.3.3.6 Appeals. 
In any action granting or denying a Certificate of Appropriateness, an appeal may be taken to the Board of Adjustment by any aggrieved party as determined under G.S. 160A-393. Such appeals shall be taken, within sixty (60) days following the commission's decision and "shall be in the nature of certiorari." According to G.S. 160A-399 and the commission's bylaws, an appeal from the commission "shall be in the nature of certiorari." Appeals of decisions involving property owned by the State of North Carolina shall be appealed to the North Carolina Historical Commission in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 160A-400.9(f). 
Any appeal from the Board of Adjustment's decision in any case shall be heard by the Superior Court of Surry County. 
Section 5.3.3.7 Compliance. 
Compliance with the terms of the Certificate of Appropriateness shall be enforced and failure to comply with a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be in violation of the City of Mount Airy Zoning Ordinance and subject to a fine of $50.00 per offense. Violations include but are not limited to: undertaking any work other than routine maintenance without securing approval in the form of a Certificate of Appropriateness; executing work in a way other than that which was approved; or, lack of progress or discontinuance of progress toward completion of a project where legitimate reasons for work stoppage are not provided. 
A Certificate of Appropriateness shall expire six (6) months after the date of issuance if the work authorized by the Certificate has not been commenced. If after commencement the work is discontinued for a period of six (6) months the permit therefore shall immediately expire. No work authorized by any Certificate which has expired shall thereafter be performed until a new Certificate has been secured. 
Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in a historic district or of a landmark which does not involve a change in design, material or appearance thereof, nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving or demolition of any such feature which the building inspector or similar official shall certify is required by the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent a property owner from making any use of his property that is not prohibited by other law. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent a) the maintenance, or b) in the event of an emergency the immediate restoration, of any existing above-ground utility structure without approval by the preservation commission. The enforcement of any remedy provided herein shall not prevent the enforcement of any other remedy or remedies provided herein or in other ordinances or laws. 
It is expected that property owners within the Mount Airy Historic Districts shall be aware and familiar with City of Mount Airy City Zoning Ordinance. An annual inspection of the Mount Airy Historic Districts will be completed each year to ensure compliance with the Historic Preservation Commission Design Guidelines. If issues are found in the Mount Airy Historic Districts, the Zoning Administrator will be notified along with the property owner and an initial warning will be issued. It is expected that the violation will be remedied within sixty (60) days of receipt of the initial warning. If prompt action is not taken by the property owner, the property is subject to a fine of $50.00 per offense. Violations include but are not limited to: undertaking any work other than routine maintenance without securing approval in the form of a Certificate of Appropriateness; executing work in a way other than that which was approved; or, lack of progress or discontinuance of progress toward completion of a project where legitimate reasons for work stoppage are not provided. Enforcement of the Historic Preservation Guidelines will be the responsibility of Zoning Administrator under the Code of Ordinances of the City of Mount Airy Article XIV, Section 14 and under G.S. 160A-365. 
Section 5.3.3.8 Demolition by Neglect. 
There is hereby established procedures and requirements for the repair or elimination of decaying and deteriorating buildings in the City's Local Historic District. 
A.  "Hardship Review Committee" means a committee composed of the Planning Director, City Engineer, and Finance Director of the City of Mount Airy, and the Chairperson of the Historic Preservation Commission, established to consider claims of undue economic hardship caused by the enforcement of [section] 5.3.3.8. 
B.  Standards. The exterior features of any building or structure located within the City's Local Historic District shall be preserved by the owner and/or parties in interest against decay, deterioration and structural defects. The owner and/or parties in interest shall upon written request of the city repair such exterior features if they are found to be deteriorating, or if their condition is contributing to deterioration, including but not limited to, any of the following defects: 
1.  Deterioration of exterior walls, foundations, flooring, parapet walls, roofs, beams, chimneys and either horizontal or vertical load bearing supports that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing or buckling; 
2.  Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs and foundations, including broken windows/doors, failed paint, leaking roofing, decayed brickwork or failed siding materials; 
3.  Rotting, holes and other forms of decay; 
4.  Damages caused by fire or other calamity; 
5.  Deterioration of exterior stairs, porches, handrails, window/door frames, cornices, entablatures, wall facings or other architectural details that causes delaminating, instability, loss of shape or crumbling; 
6.  Deterioration of fences, gates, garden walls or accessory structures; 
7.  Deterioration of any exterior feature that creates or permits a hazardous or unsafe condition to life, health or other property. 
Boarded up windows and street barricades are allowed if approved with a Certificate of Appropriateness and they are painted a similar color to the remaining exterior façade. 
C.  Inspection Authority. Authority to assure compliance with the standards set forth in this Article is vested in the Planning Director, who shall have the following duties: 
It shall be the duty of the Chief Building Inspector to periodically examine the buildings and structures in the City's Local Historic District for the purpose of determining their condition and for the purpose of the enforcement and administration of this Article. In exercising this power, the Planning Director shall, if required to fulfill his or her duties under this Article, have the right to enter on any premises within the City's Local Historic District at all reasonable hours (between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday and at the convenience of the occupant) for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action, upon presentation of proper credentials. Upon refusal by the owner or other person in legal possession to permit entry, the Planning Director, after proper notice, shall have the right to inspect pursuant to an administrative search warrant issued in accordance with the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 15-27.2. 
It shall be the responsibility of the owner or parties in interest to relocate any moveable obstructions (furniture, boxes, appliances and construction material, for example) that would otherwise interfere with a complete inspection. The Planning Director shall not be expected to detect violations of this Article when such violations are concealed behind, under or above walls, floors, ceilings or other fixed components of the building. 
D.  Petition and Action. A property owner or any other interested person may file a petition with the Planning Director listing the specific defects in a building or structure no earlier than six months after the adoption of this Article requesting that he or she act to require the correction of the deterioration or the making of repairs. The Planning Director will use the six-month timeframe to systematically inspect buildings and structures in the City's Local Historic District and contact property owners to notify them of any violations. Correction or repairs will be required under the following procedures: 
1.  Whenever a petition is filed with the Planning Director or whenever it appears to the Director (on his or her own motion or otherwise) that a building or structure is undergoing demolition by neglect, the Inspector shall, if his preliminary investigation discovers a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner and/or parties in interest a complaint stating: 
(a)  The charges, including a description of the condition causing the demolition by neglect, and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the Planning Director in City Hall, not less than ten nor more than thirty days after the serving of such complaint; 
(b)  That the owner and/or parties of interest shall have the right to answer and give testimony at the hearing; 
(c)  That the Hardship Review Committee, as defined in this Article, shall also be given notice of the hearing; and 
(d)  That the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in the hearing before the Inspector. 
2.  The purpose of the hearing is to receive evidence concerning the charge of demolition by neglect and to consider any claim of undue economic hardship made by the owner and/or parties in interest. 
3.  If, after such notice and hearing, the Planning Director determines that the building or structure is undergoing demolition by neglect according to the standards listed in this Article, the Director shall state in writing the findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and/or parties in interest an order to repair within a stated time period, which time period shall be reasonable in terms of the amount of work required, those elements of the building or structure that are deteriorating, contributing to deterioration or deteriorated. 
4.  Complaints or orders issued by the Planning Director shall be served upon persons either personally, or by registered or certified mail. When service is made by registered or certified mail, a copy of the complaint or order may also be sent by regular mail. Service shall be deemed sufficient if the registered or certified mail is unclaimed or refused, but the regular mail is not returned by the post office within ten (10) days after the mailing. 
5.  If the identities of any owners or the whereabouts of persons are unknown and cannot be ascertained by the Planning Director in the exercise of reasonable diligence, or if the owners and/or parties in interest are known but have refused to accept service by registered or certified mail, and the Planning Director makes an affidavit to that effect, then the service of the complaint or order upon the owners and/or parties in interest may be made by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the city at least once no later than the time at which personal service would be required under the provisions of this Article. When service is made by publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the building or structure thereby affected. 
6.  Failure on the part of any owner and/or parties of interest to receive or have served upon them any complaint, notice or order herein provided for, shall not affect or invalidate the proceedings with respect to any other owner or party in interest or any other person. 
7.  In the event that the owner and/or other parties in interest wish to petition for a claim of undue economic hardship, the Planning Director's order shall be stayed until after the Hardship Review Committee's determination of such hardship. All claims of undue economic hardship shall be made within 15 days of the issuance of the order to repair the building or structure by filing such claim with the Planning Director. 
E.  Safeguards from Undue Economic Hardship. When a claim of undue economic hardship is made, the Planning Director shall notify the Hardship Review Committee within ten (10) days following the receipt of such claim. The Committee shall schedule a hearing on the claim within 15 days of receiving notice that a hearing is requested. Enforcement proceedings shall be stayed until the Committee makes a decision. 
When a claim of undue economic hardship is made owning to the effects of demolition by neglect, the burden of proof shall be upon the owner and/or parties in interest to provide evidence during the hearing upon the claim, describing the circumstances of the hardship, which shall include: 
1.  Nature of ownership (individual, business or nonprofit) or legal possession, custody, control, residency and a description of the building or structure; 
2.  Financial resources of the owner and/or parties of interest; 
3.  Cost of repairs; 
4.  Assessed value of the land and improvements; 
5.  Real estate taxes for the previous two years; 
6.  Amount paid for the property, date of purchase and party from whom purchased, including a description of the relationship between the owner and the person from whom the property was purchased or other means of acquisition of title, such as by gift or inheritance. 
7.  Annual debt service, if any for previous two years; and 
8.  Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked and offers received, if any. 
9.  Proof of application status for historic tax credits as filed with the State of North Carolina. 
10.  If the property is income producing: 
a.  Annual gross income from the property for last two years; 
b.  Itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two years, including proof that adequate and competent management procedures were followed; 
c.  Annual cash flow, if any, for the previous two years. 
F.  Committee's Action on Claim of Undue Hardship. Within fifteen days of the Committee's hearing on a claim of undue economic hardship, the Committee shall make a finding of undue or no undue hardship and shall enter the reasons for such finding into the record. In the event of a finding of no undue hardship, the Committee shall report such a finding to the Planning Director and the Planning Director shall issue an order for such property to be repaired within the time recommended by the Committee, if any, but not a shorter time than specified in the order originally issued by the Director. 
In the event of a finding of economic or other hardship, the finding may be accompanied by a recommendation to relieve the hardship. This plan may include, but is not limited to, loans or grants from the city or other public, private or non profit sources, acquisition by purchase, changes in applicable zoning regulations or relax ation of the provisions of this Division sufficient to mitigate the hardship. The Committee shall report the finding and plan to the Planning Director. The Director shall issue an order for such property to be repaired within a specified time and according to the provisions of the recommended plan. The Hardship Review Committee may extend the deadline specified by the Planning Director if substantial progress to remedy the situation is demonstrated. 
G.  Appeals. Orders made by the Planning Director or decisions of the Hardship Review Committee may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the procedures found in Article 12 of this Ordinance. The aggrieved party must file the application for an appeal within thirty days following the receipt of an order for repair of the building or structure or a determination by the Committee on a claim for undue economic hardship. Decisions of the Board of Adjustment shall be subject to review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Any petition for review by the superior court shall be filed with the clerk of superior court within 30 days after the decision of the Board of Adjustment is filed or delivered as provided by the rules and procedures of the Board. 
H.  Other Powers. Nothing in this Article shall diminish the city's power to declare a building unsafe or in violation of the minimum housing ordinance under the General Statutes of North Carolina or other public safety ordinances of the city.

ARTICLE VI. - TABLE OF PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES 

Sec. 6.1. - General. 
    The Table of Permitted and Conditional Uses which follows contains a listing of uses which may be permitted in one or more of the various Zoning Districts established by this Ordinance. Uses are listed in alphabetical order in nine functional categories. The categories in the order of listing are: 
Residential Uses

Business, Professional, and Personal Services 
Retail Trade 
Wholesale Trade 
Manufacturing and Industrial Uses 
Public Works Facilities, Utilities, and Infrastructure 
Miscellaneous 
Sec. 6.2. - Entries. 
    The District or Districts in which a particular listed use may be permitted is indicated by an "X" or "C" in the District column(s) opposite the listed use. 
Sec. 6.3. - Meaning of Entries. 
    The meanings of the entries in the Table are as follows: 
(1)  "X" indicates the use is permitted by right and a Zoning Permit may be obtained.

Sec. 9.1 - General Provisions. 
A.  Purpose. These sign regulations are adopted under the zoning authority of the City of Mount Airy in furtherance of the more general purposes set forth in this Article. The purpose of these sign regulations are: 
1.  To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication while preserving the rights of free speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; 
2.  To maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the City's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; 
3.  To enhance the viability of local commerce with effective, fair, and reasonable sign restrictions; 
4.  To improve pedestrian and traffic safety; 
5.  To minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; and 
6.  To enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions. 
B.  Applicability. A sign may be constructed, erected, placed, established, painted, created, or maintained in the City's zoning jurisdiction only in conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions, and other requirements of this Article. The effect of this Article as more specifically set forth herein is: 
1.  To establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in commercial and industrial zones, and a limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards and the permit procedures of this Article; 
2.  To allow certain signs that are small, unobtrusive, and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this Article, but without a requirement for permits; 
3.  To prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this Article; and 
4.  To provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this Article. 
C.  Alteration of Signs. The replacement of sign faces, lettering, or other features of a sign shall be considered maintenance and shall not require a permit. No alteration which modifies the area, height, or illumination of a sign, or alters its location shall be permitted under this provision. 
D.  Signs on Public Property Forfeited. Any sign installed or placed on public property or within a public right-of-way, except in conformance with the requirements of this Article shall be forfeited to the public and is subject to confiscation. In addition to other remedies hereunder, the Administrator shall have the right to recover from the owner or person placing such a sign the full costs of removal and disposal of such sign. 
E.  Sign Permits. To ensure compliance with the provisions of this Article, all persons proposing to display a sign shall obtain a sign permit, in accordance with the general procedure established for the issuance of permits in this Ordinance, unless otherwise expressly exempted from such requirement. When a permit is required, a permit shall be issued prior to the installation or placement of such sign. 
1.  Permanent Signs Requiring a Permit. The types of permanent signs listed below shall be required to receive a permit: 
a.  Wall Signs (9.4.B) 
b.  Freestanding Ground Signs (9.4.C) 
c.  Awning Signs (9.4.D) 
d.  Projecting Signs (9.4.E) 
e.  Canopy Signs (9.4.F) 
f.  Incidental Signs (9.4.G (1) and (2)) 
2.  Signage Plan Required. For any lot on which the owner proposes to erect one (1) or more signs requiring a permit or for a combined development or other multi-tenant development, a signage plan shall be required, which includes the following information: 
a.  An accurate plot plan of the lot or parcel, at such scale as the Administrator may reasonably require; 
b.  Location of buildings, parking lots, driveways, and landscaped areas on such lot or parcel; 
c.  Computation of the maximum total sign area, the maximum area for individual signs, the height of signs, and the number of signs of each type allowed on the lot(s) or parcel(s) included in the plan under this Article; and 
d.  An accurate indication on the plot plan of the proposed location of each present and future sign of any type. 
3.  Temporary Signs Requiring a Permit. The display of certain temporary signs, including the recurring placement of certain signs where permitted, shall require a permit for such temporary sign prior to its display. 
a.  Temporary signs requiring a permit. 
1)  Type 3 Freestanding Temporary Signs (9.3.C.4) 
2)  Portable Changeable Copy Signs (9.3.H) 
b.  Permit Procedure and Standards. 
1)  Persons submitting an application for a temporary sign permit shall provide sufficient information, including the physical characteristics, display location, and proposed period of display (if applicable), in order to determine its compliance with the applicable regulations. 
2)  Only those signs which meet all of the requirements established by Section 9.3 for the particular type of sign may be permitted. Signs not meeting those regulations will be denied a permit. 
3)  Failure to obtain a permit for a temporary sign that is required to be permitted prior to displaying it is a violation of this Ordinance. 
F.  Sign Area Computations. The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height: 
1.  Computation of Area of Single-faced Signs. The area of a sign face shall be computed by means of the smallest square or rectangle, that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself. 
2.  Computation of Area of Multi-faced Signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two (2) identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one (1) of the faces. 
Figure 9-1 
Measurement of a Sign Face 

3.  Computation of Height. The height of a freestanding sign shall be computed as the vertical distance from the point of the sign that is level with the highest paved portion of the street right-of-way or recorded access easement to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. The highest paved portion of the street right-of-way or recorded access easement shall be measured along the frontage of the property where the sign will located at the point nearest the sign location. The design, colors, and/or materials of the base or supports of any sign that is below the paved portion of the street right-of-way or recorded access easement shall be consistent with, or complimentary to, the portions of the sign above that point. 
Figure 9-2 
Measurement of Sign Height 

G.  Clear Site Distance Required. Clear site distance at street intersections is required. Signs shall be located outside of the required sight triangle as detailed in Table 9-1 and Figure 9-3. Site triangles are required in every zoning district except for the B-1 District. Sight triangles must be shown on all submitted plans depicting the location of signage for sign permit applications.

J.  Nonconforming Signs. In the interest of encouraging the eventual removal of signs that do not meet the current standards of the ordinance, the following standards are established to require the removal of nonconforming signs under certain circumstances. 
1.  Discontinuance of Occupancy and/or Use.

For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a non-conforming apartment building for one hundred and twenty (120) days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a non-conforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, cessation of operation or occupancy of the non-conforming use for the one hundred twenty (120) day period or removal for any period of time, shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. 
Sec. 11.8. - Discontinuance of Non-conforming Adult Oriented Businesses. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.7 above, Adult Oriented Businesses shall be governed by the following: 
1.  Any Adult Oriented Business that fails to comply with the use and locational requirements of this Ordinance but which was lawfully operating before the effective date of this Ordinance, shall not be deemed to be in violation of this Ordinance but shall be a non-conformity. Any such business which ceases active operation for a period of thirty (30) days regardless of the purpose or reason shall be subject to all the requirements of this Ordinance and the property may thereafter be used only for conforming uses. 
2.  Any Adult Oriented Business lawfully operating as of the effective date of this Ordinance but which subsequently fails to comply with the use and locational requirements of this Ordinance as the result of changes within the vicinity or amendment to this Ordinance, shall not be deemed to be in violation of this Ordinance but shall be a non-conformity. Any such business which ceases active operation for a period of thirty (30) days regardless of purpose or reason shall be subject to all the requirements of this Ordinance and the property may thereafter be used only for conforming uses. 
3.  Any Adult Oriented Business that is rendered a non-conforming use as a result of the conditions described in 1. and 2. above shall either cease to operate or meet all of the requirements of this Ordinance for the use no later than sixty (60) days from the date that the Adult Oriented Business becomes a non-conforming use.

Sec. 12.3. - Appeals, Hearings, and Notice. 
    An appeal from the decision of the Zoning Administrator may be taken by the aggrieved party to the Board of Adjustment.

Sec. 12.4. - Stay of Proceedings. 
    An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board of Adjustment after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a court or record on application, on notice to the Zoning Administrator, on due cause shown. 
Sec. 12.5. - Powers and Duties of the Board of Adjustment. 
    The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers and duties. 
A.  Administrative Review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this Ordinance. 
B.  Change In Kind of Non-Conforming Use. The Board may permit change in use from one non-conforming use to another as provided for in Section 11.5. 
C.  Zoning Permits with Vested Rights. To hear and decide Zoning Permits With Vested Rights in accordance with Article XIV of this Ordinance. 
D.  Conditional Use Permits. To hear and decide, in particular cases, and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, permits for conditional uses as authorized by Article VI. In granting a conditional use permit the Board shall make the following affirmative findings: 
(1)  The Use requested is among those listed as an eligible Conditional Use in the District in which the subject property is located. 
(2)  That the Conditional Use will not materially endanger the public health or safety if located where proposed and developed according to the plan as proposed; 
(3)  That the Conditional Use meets all required conditions and specifications; 
(4)  That the Conditional Use will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property, or that the use is a public necessity; and, 
(5)  That the location and character of the Conditional Use if developed according to the plan as proposed will be in harmony with the area in which it is to be located and in general conformity with the plan of development of the City and its environs. 
All Conditional Use applications within Historic Landmarks and Preservation Overlay Districts shall be reviewed by the Historic Preservation Commission at its next regular meeting after the application has been submitted in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance. The Historic Preservation Commission shall forward its comments and recommendations within 45 days of the filing of the application to the Board of Adjustment. 
In granting a Conditional Use Permit, the Board may impose such additional restrictions and requirements upon such Permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this ordinance are served, public welfare secured and substantial justice done. If all requirements and conditions are accepted by the applicant, the Board shall authorize the issuance of the Conditional Use Permit, otherwise the Permit shall be denied. Any Conditional Use Permit so authorized shall be perpetually binding upon the property included in such Permit unless subsequently changed or amended by the Board, as provided for in this Article. 
The Board may change or amend any Conditional Use Permit, after a public hearing and subject to the same consideration as provided for in this Article for the original issuance of Conditional Use Permit. 
No proposal to amend or change any Conditional Use Permit shall be considered within three (3) months of the date of the original authorization of such Permit or within three (3) months of hearing of any previous proposal to amend or change any such Permit. 
E.  Variances. When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of the zoning ordinance, the board of adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the ordinance upon a showing of all of the following: 
(1)  Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property. 
(2)  The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. 
(3)  The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship. 
(4)  The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved. 
No change in permitted uses may be authorized by a variance. Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance. 
F.  Variances From Watershed Overlay District Requirements. The Board of Adjustment may authorize variances from the specific requirements of the Watershed Overlay Districts in the same manner and subject to the same procedures and requirements of this Ordinance for authorizing other variances, provided that: 
(1)  A notice be mailed by first class mail to all other local governments having watershed regulation jurisdiction within the particular watershed where the variance is requested and to each entity using that water supply for consumption. 
(2)  If the variance request is for a major variance as defined herein the following procedure shall apply. If the Board of Adjustment decides in favor of granting the major variance, the Board shall then prepare a preliminary record of the hearing and submit it to the North Carolina Environmental Commission (EMC) for review and action. If the Board does not decide in favor or granting the major variances such unfavorable action shall constitute denial. 
(3)  In the event of a favorable action by the Board on a major variance, the Board shall cause the record of their hearing to be promptly submitted to the EMC. The record of the hearing shall include but not be limited to: 
a)  The variance application; 
b)  The hearing notices; 
c)  The evidence presented; 
d)  Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence, and rulings on them; 
e)  Findings and exception; and 
f)  The action of the Board including any conditions proposed. 
(4)  If the EMC approves the major variance or approves with conditions or stipulations added, the EMC shall prepare a decision which authorizes the Board of Adjustment to issue a final decision which would include any conditions or stipulations added by the EMC. If the EMC denies the major variance, then the EMC shall prepare and transmit it to the Board of Adjustment. The Board shall then prepare a final decision denying the major variance. 
G.  Interpretation of the Watershed Boundaries. The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to make adjustments to the exterior boundary of Watershed Overlay Districts by removing all or part of a piece of property from a Watershed Overlay District where it finds that all or part of such property actually lies outside the drainage area of such Watershed. In any case where there is a dispute as to whether a property or any part of a property that is shown on the Official Zoning Map as being in a Watershed Overlay District actually drains to that Watershed, the Board of Adjustment shall, upon appeal by the owner, make a determination as to the facts of the matter as it affects the subject property. 
In determining whether a property or part of a property drains to the Watershed as indicated on the map, the Board of Adjustment shall base its determination on actual field conditions of the property as determined by topographical conditions. In making its determination, the Board of Adjustment may require the appellant to produce relevant expert testimony and exhibits. 
After hearing such appeal, the Board shall find that the subject property (all or part) is either in the designated Watershed or out of the designated Watershed. If the Board shall find that the subject property is out of the designated Watershed, the Board shall order the Map to be adjusted to show the subject property to be outside the designated Watershed. In making such order, the Board of Adjustment shall designate the Watershed in which the subject property is located. If such designation causes the subject property to be located in another Watershed Overlay District, the order shall cause the map to be adjusted to show the same. 
H.  Variance From Flood Damage Prevention Overlay District Requirements. The Board may authorize variances from the specific requirements of the Flood Damage Prevention Overly District in the same manner and subject to the same procedures and requirements of this ordinance for authorizing other variances. 
1.  In passing upon such variances, the Board shall consider all technical evaluations and relevant factors, and: 
  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed facility; 
  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and effects of wave action if applicable, expected at the site; and 
  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
2.  The findings listed above shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustment in writing, and included in the application for a variance. 
3.  Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of this Section, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Section. 
4.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if there is any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge. 
5.  Conditions for variances are as follows: 
  Variances may not be issued when the variance will render the structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
-  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
-  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
-  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased [flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create] nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
6.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest flood elevation. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
7.  The Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
I.  Act on Appeals in the Historic Landmarks and Preservation Overlay District. The Board shall have the following specific powers and duties in the Historic Landmarks and Preservation Overlay District: 
1.  Restoration or Reconstruction. Where it is found by the Historic Preservation Commission that an application for a zoning permit covers activity constituting an authentic restoration or reconstruction in the same location as the original location and in the original conformation of a structure of historic and/or architectural significance to the Historic Landmark or District, such activity may be approved by the Board of Adjustment following approval by the Historic Preservation Commission, even though it does not meet dimensional regulations. 
The Board of Adjustment, in approving such authentic reconstruction or restoration, may attach reasonable and appropriate conditions to the approval, such that the public health, safety and general welfare shall be protected. 
In addition to any other condition the Board of Adjustment may make regarding such authorization, any items restored, reconstructed, or maintained on, over, or within a public sidewalk, public alley area, or other public way shall be the responsibility of the owner, his heirs and assigns. The owner's restoration, reconstruction, or maintenance of any such item within such area shall constitute the owner's agreement to protect and hold the City of Mount Airy blameless against any and all liability, cost, damage, or expense suffered by the City of Mount Airy as a result of or growing out of the restoration, reconstruction, or maintenance thereof. Such items, so approved may be lawfully restored, reconstructed, or maintained. Any such items projecting onto the vehicular travel way of a street or alley shall be, at its lowest point, 12 feet above the travel way. 
2.  Parking Waiver. Where the Historic Preservation Commission, in considering an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, shall make a written finding that the number of off-street parking spaces required by this ordinance for the building or structure for which a building permit is requested would render the building incongruous with the historic aspects of the landmark or district it shall recommend to the Board of Adjustment a waiver, in part or in whole, of the off-street parking requirements. The Board of Adjustment may authorize a lesser number of off-street parking spaces provided (a) the Board finds that the lesser number of off-street parking spaces will not create problems due to increased on-street parking, and (b) will not constitute a threat to the public safety. 
3.  Appeal From Granting or Denial of Certificate of Appropriateness. An appeal may be taken to the Board of Adjustment from the Commission's action in granting or denying an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness. Such appeal may be taken by any aggrieved party, shall be taken within times prescribed by the Historic Preservation Commission by general rule, and shall be in the nature of certiorari. 
Any appeal from the Board of Adjustment's decision in any case shall be heard by the Superior Court of Surry County. 
(Ord. No. 2014-025, 5-1-14) 
Sec. 12.6. - Appeals from the Board of Adjustment. 
    Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the Board, any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the jurisdiction of this Ordinance may, within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in the office of the Board, but not thereafter, present to a court of competent jurisdiction a petition duly verified setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or part, specifying the ground of illegality, whereupon such decision of said Board shall be subject to review by certiorari as provided by law.

Section 13.3. - Submittal. 
    All applications for amendments to this Ordinance shall be in writing, signed and filed with the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator, before scheduling any application for amendment for consideration by the Planning Board, shall ensure that it contains all the required information as specified in this Ordinance and on the application form. Applications which are not complete, or otherwise do not comply with the provisions of this Ordinance shall not be scheduled by the Zoning Administrator, but shall be returned to the applicant with a notation of the deficiencies in the application. 
    All applications for amendment shall contain, as a minimum, a description of the proposed change, and if it would require a change of the zoning maps, the application shall include a map drawn to a scale of not less than four hundred (400) feet to the inch and not more than twenty (20) feet to the inch showing the land covered by the proposed amendment, a legal description of the property and a list of names and addresses of all owners of property involved in the map change and all adjoining property owners as shown on County tax records. 
    For a conditional district rezoning, the applicant shall submit an amendment application and a preliminary site specific development plan to the Zoning Administrator. In the amendment application, the applicant shall describe the exact land use(s) proposed for the conditional district rezoning. Such use(s) may be selected from any of the uses, whether permitted by right or conditional, allowed in the general zoning district upon which the conditional district rezoning is based. The applicant may also submit any other conditions limiting the type, scope or intensity of development or use of the subject property for consideration by the Board of Commissioners. Following approval of the rezoning, the applicant shall file an application for a final site specific development plan with the Zoning Administrator that is consistent with the approved preliminary site specific development plan and any supplemental conditions set forth as part of the conditional district rezoning approval.

    The Planning Board shall either recommend in favor of an amendment or in opposition to an amendment by simple majority vote of those present and voting. The Board may also propose conditions to their recommendation. A tie vote on a proposal shall be considered to be in opposition to such amendment. 
(Ord. No. 2015-025, 4-16-15) 
Section 13.5. - Board of Commissioners Action. 
    The Zoning Administrator shall present any recommended amendments to the Board of Commissioners at a regularly scheduled meeting, following Planning Board action, at which it hears rezoning proposals. The Zoning Administrator shall transmit to the Board of Commissioners the Planning Board's record of action on the proposed amendments.

(Ord. No. 2015-025, 4-16-15) 
Section 13.6. - Special Provisions for Conditional District Rezonings. 
    The Board of Commissioners shall hear the conditional district rezoning request and review the preliminary site specific development plan concurrently, except that the final decision to approve or deny each request shall be by a separate vote. The Board of Commissioners shall first make a decision whether to grant approval for the requested conditional district rezoning. If the conditional district rezoning request is denied, the Board of Commissioners will no longer consider the request for approval of the preliminary site specific development plan. If the conditional district rezoning is approved, the Board of Commissioners shall then make a decision whether to approve the preliminary site specific development plan. 
    The approval of a rezoning to a conditional zoning district does not authorize development activity. The rezoning to the conditional zoning district and approval of the preliminary site specific development plan shall authorize the applicant to apply for a final site specific development plan. Final site specific development plans shall be reviewed by the Technical Review Committee. The approval of a final site specific development plan shall constitute approval of the use(s) requested in the application and approved by the Board of Commissioners. 
    If any condition imposed, or consideration made, is found to be illegal or invalid, or if an applicant should fail to accept a condition such conditional district rezoning and preliminary site specific development plan shall be null and void. Proceedings will be instigated to rezone the property to its previous classification. 
    A violation of a condition of rezoning to a conditional zoning district as set forth in the final development plan and a violation of other related official documents associated with such rezoning are considered violations of this Ordinance subject to the same remedies and penalties. Upon determining that such a violation has occurred, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the property owner of his findings and set a reasonable time for the violation to be corrected or abated in accordance with Article XIV. When a violation is not corrected or abated within the time period set by the Administrator, the Administrator or any person aggrieved may institute appropriate action proceedings to correct or abate the violation consistent with Article XIV of this Ordinance.

1.  [Procedures.] In any case where the applicant for a Zoning Permit desires to obtain a vested right, as authorized by G.S. 160A-385.1, the applicant shall observe the following procedures: 
a.  The applicant shall submit to the Zoning Administrator seven (7) copies of a site specific development plan drawn to scale describing with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for the specific parcel or parcels of land. Such plan shall include: 
1)  The boundaries of the site; 
2)  Significant topographical and other natural features affecting the development of the site; 
3)  The location on the site of the proposed buildings, structures, and other improvements; 
4)  The dimensions, including height, of the proposed buildings and other structures; 
5)  The location of all existing and proposed infrastructure on the site, including water, sewer, roads and walkways; and, 
6)  Such other information as the Zoning Administrator may determine to be necessary in order to determine the specifics of the plan. 
b.  Public Hearing; Notice Thereof. Upon receipt of a properly prepared site specific development plan the Zoning Administrator shall arrange to bring such plan before the Planning Board in the manner of a public hearing. Completed plans shall be received a minimum of fourteen (14) days prior to the public hearing at which the proposed site plan is scheduled to be considered by the Board. Notice of the public hearing shall be given in the same manner as that required for a variance. 
In considering an application for a Zoning Permit With Vested Rights the Planning Board shall give due regard that the purpose and intent of this Ordinance shall be served, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. If the Board should find, after public hearing, that the proposed Permit should not be granted, such proposed Permit shall be denied. 
In granting such Permit, the Planning Board shall make the following affirmative findings: 
1)  The use requested is among those listed as a Permitted or Conditional Use in the District in which the subject property is located or is to be located and complies with all the requirements of this Ordinance and other applicable ordinances. 
2)  The requested Permit is either essential or desirable for the public convenience or welfare. 
3)  The requested Permit will not impair the integrity or character of the surrounding or adjoining Districts, and will not be detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of the community. 
4)  Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, sanitation and/or other necessary facilities have been or are being provided. 
In granting a Zoning Permit With Vested Rights, the Planning Board may impose such additional restrictions and requirements upon such Certificate as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this Ordinance are served, public welfare secured and substantial justice done. Approval of a site specific development plan with the condition that a variance, Conditional Use Permit or modification be obtained shall not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance, Conditional Use Permit or modification is obtained. If all requirements and conditions are accepted by the applicant, the Board shall authorize the issuance of the Permit, otherwise the Permit shall be denied. Any Permit so authorized shall remain vested for a period of two years from the date of the action granting the Permit. 
2.  Violations. Any violation of a term or condition involved in the granting of a Zoning Permit With Vested Rights shall be treated the same as a violation of this Ordinance and shall be subject to the same remedies and penalties as any such violation. In addition, the Planning Board may, after public hearing, revoke any such vested rights for failure to abide by any such term or condition. 
3.  Other Ordinances Apply. The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning which imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity or use, or ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land-use regulation, including, but not limited to building, fire, mechanical, electrical and plumbing codes. 
4.  Changes or Amendments. No change or amendment to any Permit With Vested Rights shall be made except after public hearing and except as provided for in this Ordinance for the original issuance of such Permit. If, at the time of consideration of proposed change or amendment to an existing Permit, such Permit or proposed change or amendment could not be lawfully made under Ordinance conditions existing at that time, such proposed change or amendment shall be denied. In addition, in no case shall there be an extension of the two-year time period for which such development right is vested. Nothing herein shall exempt plans related to such Permit from subsequent reviews and approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original approvals. 
5.  Status at Expiration of Term. A right which has been vested shall terminate at the end of the two-year vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid Building Permit applications have been filed. Upon issuance of a Building Permit, the provisions of G.S. § 160A-418 and G.S. § 160A-422 shall apply except that a Building Permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the running of time while a vested right under this Section is outstanding. Any development constructed pursuant to a Zoning Permit With Vested Rights for which the vested term has expired and which is not in conformance with all the terms of this Ordinance because of changes made in the provisions of this Ordinance, including the Zoning Map, after the issuance of such Permit shall be subject to the provisions of this Ordinance relating to non-conformities the same as any other non-conformity. 
6.  Annexation Declaration. Any landowner who signs an annexation petition to the City pursuant to G.S. §§ 160A-31 or 60A-58.1 shall, as part of that petition, file a signed statement declaring whether or not vested rights with respect to the property subject to the petition have been established under G.S. §§ 160A-385.1 or 153A-344.1. If the statement declares that such rights have been established, the City may require petitioners to provide proof of such rights. A statement which declares that no vested rights have been established by law shall be binding on the landowner and any such vested right shall be terminated.
