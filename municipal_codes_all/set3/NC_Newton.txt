PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Newton, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1972 Code, as supplemented through Ordinance No. 2005.6, adopted April 5, 2005, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1972 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Supervising Editor, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Edward F. Burchins, City Manager, Mr. Larry W. Pitts, City Attorney, and Ms. Rita K. Williams, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

This policy covers all city motorized equipment including cars, trucks, specially equipped trucks, track equipment, backhoes, front-end loaders, police cars and motorcycles, whether operating on or off the road.

(6)	A minimum amount of auxiliary safety equipment and supplies for vehicles will be established by the board (i.e., fire extinguishers, flares, signs, etc.). 
(7)	An individual who has an accident and does not report it will forego any rights to prize monies and will be charged with the accident. 
(Code 1972, § 14-68; Ord. No. 79.24)

(Code 1972, § 5-27; Ord. No. 81.22) 
Editor's note- When permission to inspect a dwelling or its premises is denied, the code enforcement officer must obtain a warrant to inspect. G.S. 15-27.2 provides for the issuance of warrants for the conduct of inspections authorized by law. The North Carolina court of appeals, in In Re Dwelling, 24 N.C. App. 17 (1974), has held that the consent of the tenant-occupant who was in actual possession and control of the premises was sufficient to authorize an inspection without a warrant, notwithstanding the fact that the owner had objected to the warrantless search. When faced with a situation where permission to inspect is denied, building inspectors are advised to seek the advice of the city attorney. 
Sec. 18-74. - Procedure for enforcement. 
(a)	Preliminary investigation; notice; hearing. Whenever a petition is filed with the code enforcement officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the city charging that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, or whenever it appears to the code enforcement officer upon inspection, that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, he shall, if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such dwelling or dwelling unit a complaint stating the charges and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the code enforcement officer at a place therein fixed, not less than ten nor more than 30 days after the serving of the complaint. The owner or any party in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. Notice of such hearing shall also be given to at least one of the persons signing a petition relating to such dwelling. Any person desiring to do so may attend such hearing and give evidence relevant to the matter being heard. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the inspector. 
(b)	Procedure after hearing. 
(1)	After such notice and hearing, the code enforcement officer shall state in writing his determination whether the dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation and, if so, whether it is deteriorated or dilapidated. 
(2)	If the code enforcement officer determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is deteriorated, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter or improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this article within a specified period of time, not to exceed 90 days. Such order may also direct and require the owner to vacate and close such dwelling or dwelling unit until such repairs, alterations and improvements have been made. 
(3)	If the code enforcement officer determines that the dwelling is dilapidated, he shall state in writing his findings of fact to support such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner either to repair, alter or improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this article, or else to vacate and remove or demolish the same within a specified period of time not to exceed 90 days. 
(c)	Failure to comply with order. 
(1)	In personam remedy. If the owner of any deteriorated dwelling or dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the code enforcement officer to repair, alter or improve, or to vacate and close the same, within the time specified therein, or if the owner of a dilapidated dwelling or dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the code enforcement officer to repair, alter or improve or to vacate and close and remove or demolish the same within the time specified therein, the code enforcement officer shall submit to the council at its next regular meeting a resolution directing the city attorney to petition the superior court for an order directing such owner to comply with the order of the code enforcement officer, as authorized by G.S. 160A-446(g). 
(2)	In rem remedy. After failure of an owner of a deteriorated or dilapidated dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with an order of the code enforcement officer within the time specified therein, if injunctive relief has not been sought or has not been granted as provided in subsection (1) of this subsection, the code enforcement officer shall submit to the council an ordinance ordering the code enforcement officer to cause such dwelling or dwelling unit to be repaired, altered, improved, vacated, closed, removed or demolished, as provided in the original order of the code enforcement officer, and pending removal or demolition, to place a placard on such dwelling as provided by G.S. 160A-443 and section 18-76.

Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the code enforcement officer shall forthwith transmit to the board of adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from a decision of the code enforcement officer refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When an appeal is from a decision of the code enforcement officer requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the board of adjustment unless the code enforcement officer certifies to the board after the notice of appeal is filed with him that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant), a suspension of his requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order. Such a restraining order may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than one day's written notice to the code enforcement officer, by the board or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. 160A-446(f) and subsection (e) of this section. 
(2)	The board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of the code enforcement officer, but the concurring vote of four members of the board of adjustment shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the code enforcement officer. The board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the article, to adapt the application of this article to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of this article shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. 
(3)	Every decision of the board of adjustment shall be subject to review by proceedings in the nature of certioram instituted within 15 days of the decision of the board, but not otherwise.

    Alarm system means any electronic or mechanical device which transmits an electronic alarm signal or recorded message to the city police/fire department or other receiving station indicating an actual or attempted unauthorized entry into a building or indicating the commission or attempted commission of a crime or indicating a fire in or about a building. For purposes of this definition, the term "other receiving station" means any person or business that receives an electronic alarm signal or recorded message and transmits information regarding such signal or message to the city police/fire department. 
    Alarm system owner means any person, corporation, partnership, governmental or educational entity owning or leasing an alarm system. 
    Audible alarm system means any alarm owned by an alarm system owner that, by sound of a whistle, bell, buzzer, siren or other noise generator, alerts those outside a home, building, factory or vehicle, but in the near vicinity, of a break-in, robbery or fire, but does not transmit a signal by telephone or other communications device. 
    False alarm means activation of an alarm system that elicits a response by the police/fire department when no situation requiring such a response does, in fact, exist. This includes accidental, avoidable and unnecessary alarm activation due to user error, equipment malfunction, improper or unsuited equipment, but does not include alarm activation caused by violent conditions of nature or other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm user including disruption of the telephone circuits, an area power failure, or failure of the equipment at the receiving station. 
(Code 1972, § 5A-1; Ord. No. 98.54, § 1, 10-6-1998) 
Sec. 22-142. - False alarms. 
(a)	Notice to owner . If either the police/fire department receives in excess of two false alarms within a calendar quarter from any single alarm system, a notice will be sent to the alarm system owner indicating the system must be inspected by a state licensed alarm industry, business or representative. That user will have ten working days, excluding holidays, after receipt of that notice to return a form certifying that the alarm system has been checked out and is functioning properly. 
(b)	Charge for additional false alarms. For each false alarm after the ten-working-day period without the certification form being returned, the alarm system owner shall pay a charge of $25.00 for false police alarms and a charge of $75.00 for false fire alarms. 
(c)	Renewal of false alarm allowance. A properly returned certification form will renew the two-false-alarm allowance during the calendar quarter and the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. 
(d)	Renewal of false alarm system response. If the police/fire department receives in excess of six false alarms within a calendar quarter from any single alarm system owner or if an alarm system owner fails to pay charges within 30 days of being billed, the chief of police/fire may suspend response to that alarm system. When the chief of police/fire is satisfied that the system has been repaired and is found to be reliable, or that employees have been trained properly, he may reinstate response to the alarm system.

State Law reference- Authority to regulate sexually oriented businesses, G.S. 160A-181.1. 

Sec. 22-171. - Purpose. 
    The city council is committed to protecting the general welfare of the city through the enforcement of laws prohibiting obscenity, indecency, and sexual offenses. It seeks to reduce and eliminate the deleterious effects of sexually oriented businesses while preserving constitutionally protected forms of expression. The council finds that sexually oriented businesses in certain locations contribute to neighborhood deterioration and blight through an increase in crime and diminution of property values, among other adverse consequences, and finds that such effects are contrary to the general welfare of the city. The council recognizes that important and substantial government interests provide a constitutional basis for reasonable regulation of the time, place and manner under which sexually oriented businesses operate, and that, therefore, the council has determined that persons seeking to operate sexually oriented businesses shall be required to observe specific locational requirements before they commence business, as provided for in this article. The council finds that the licensing of sexually oriented businesses is necessary to ensure compliance with the locational and zoning requirements of such businesses. The council finds that sexually oriented businesses as in other communities have been used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution, and sexual encounters of a casual nature. The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of the city. The provisions of this article shall not be construed as permitting any use, activity or structure that is otherwise prohibited, illegal or made punishable by law, nor shall it be construed so as to prohibit conduct or expression that is subject to constitutional protection.

Further, such financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will insure continued service and compliance with all franchise obligations during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year, unless extended by the city at its discretion and, during such period of time, it shall have the right to petition for transfer of the franchise to another grantee. If the city finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualifications of the applicant, is satisfactory, the city will transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest. The consent of the city to such transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(e)	Continuation of rights of city and terms of franchise. The consent or approval of the city to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise. 
(f)	Transfer prior to completion of construction. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city will not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion of construction of the proposed system. 
(g)	Review of purchase price. The city reserves the right to review the purchase price of any transfer or assignment of the cable system. 
(h)	Acceptance of franchise by prospective controlling party. Any approval by the city of transfer of ownership or control shall be contingent upon the prospective controlling party becoming a signatory to the franchise. 
(i)	Time frame for city review. The city shall have 120 days to act upon any request for approval of such sale or transfer that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with FCC regulations and by the city. If the city fails to render a final decision on the request within 120 days, such request shall be deemed granted, unless the requesting party and the city agree to an extension of time. 
(Code 1972, § 8A-31; Ord. No. 95.33, § 1(4.11), 5-17-1995) 
Sec. 26-42. - Renewal. 
    Upon completion of the term of any franchise granted under this chapter, the city may, in its sole discretion, grant or deny renewal of the franchise of the grantee in accordance with the provisions of the Cable Act. The grantee shall own the cable communication system, but shall have no property right in the public rights-of-way upon the completion of the franchise term. 
(Code 1972, § 8A-32; Ord. No. 95.33, § 1(4.12), 5-17-1995) 
Sec. 26-43. - Police powers. 
(a)	In accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges that its rights hereunder are subject to the police power of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the city pursuant to such power. 
(b)	Any conflict between the provisions of this chapter or the franchise and any other present or future lawful exercise of the city's police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter; except that any such exercise that is not of general application in the jurisdiction or applies exclusively to the grantee or cable communications systems, which contains provisions inconsistent with this chapter, shall prevail only if, upon such exercise, the city finds an emergency exists constituting a danger to health, safety, property or general welfare and such exercise is mandated by law. 
(Code 1972, § 8A-33; Ord. No. 95.33, § 1(4.13), 5-17-1995) 
Sec. 26-44. - Fees. 
(a)	Purpose. Because the city finds that: 
(1)	The streets of the city and state to be used by the grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the franchise area are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the city and state at great expense to its taxpayers; 
(2)	The grant to the grantee to the streets is a valuable property right without which the grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions; and 
(3)	The administration of this chapter and the franchise imposes upon the city additional regulatory responsibility and expense; 
therefore, a grantee of any franchise hereunder shall pay to the city a franchise fee of five percent of the gross annual revenues. The annual franchise fee shall be in addition to any other fee and the obligation to pay such fees shall commence as of the effective date of the franchise. The city shall be furnished a statement of such payment by an independent certified public accountant, reflecting the total amounts of annual gross revenues and the above charges and computations for the period covered by the payment. 
(b)	Fee in addition to other tax or payment. This payment shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the governments or other taxing jurisdiction by the grantee. Payment of the franchise fee made by the grantee to the city shall not be considered in the nature of a tax, but shall be in addition to any and all taxes which are now or may be required hereafter to be paid by any federal, state, or local law. 
(c)	Acceptance by city. No acceptance of any payment by the city shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of the grantee. 
(d)	Failure to make required payment. In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified herein, the grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the city primary depository bank during the period that such unpaid amount is owed. 
(e)	Payments to be made annually. The franchise fee and any other cost or damage assessed against the grantee shall be payable annually to the city. The grantee shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross revenues within the franchise area during the period for which such annual payment is made, and such payment shall be made to the city no later than 45 days following the end of each calendar year. 
(f)	City's right of inspection. The city shall have the right to inspect the grantee's income records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter. Audits shall be at the expense of the grantee, if the grantee is found to be five percent in arrears or more. Any additional amount due the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to the grantee by the city, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. Nothing herein prevents the grantee from exercising its right of due process in determining the validity of any audit claims against the grantee. 
(Code 1972, § 8A-34; Ord. No. 95.33, § 1(4.14), 5-17-1995; Ord. No. 96.2, § 1, 1-24-1996) 
Sec. 26-45. - Forfeiture or revocation. 
(a)	Grounds for revocation. The city reserves the right to revoke any franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges associated with the franchise in the following circumstances, each of which shall represent a default and breach under the chapter and the franchise grant: 
(1)	If the grantee shall default in the performance of any of the material obligations under this chapter or under such documents, contracts and other terms and provisions entered into by and between the city and the grantee. 
(2)	If the grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and effect the liability and indemnification coverage or the performance bond as required herein. 
(3)	If the grantee shall violate any orders or rulings of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over the grantee relative to this chapter or the franchise. 
(4)	If the grantee evades any of the provisions of this chapter or the franchise, or practices any fraud or deceit upon the city or cable subscribers. 
(5)	If the grantee's construction schedule is delayed later than the schedule contained in the franchise or beyond any extended date set by the city. 
(6)	If the grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts or is adjudged bankrupt. 
(7)	Failure to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of interrupted service, except when approval of such interruption is obtained from the city. 
(8)	Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for, or negotiation of, the franchise or any extension or renewal thereof. 
(b)	Effect of circumstances beyond control of grantee. The grantee shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any provision of this chapter in any case in which performance of any such provision is prevented for reasons beyond the grantee's control. A fault shall not be deemed to be beyond the grantee's control if committed by a corporation or other business entity which the grantee controls. 
(c)	Pending litigation. Pending litigation or any appeal to any regulatory body or court having jurisdiction over the grantee shall not excuse the grantee from the performance of its obligations under this chapter or the franchise, unless such regulatory body or court has issued a valid order excusing such performance. Failure of the grantee to perform such obligations because of pending litigation or petition may result in forfeiture or revocation pursuant to the provisions of this section. 
(d)	Procedure prior to revocation. 
(1)	The city shall make written demand that the grantee do so comply with any such requirement, limitation, term condition, rule or regulation or correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If the failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee continues for a period of 30 days following such written demand, the city shall place its request for termination of the franchise upon a regular aldermen meeting agenda. The city shall cause to be served upon such grantee, at least seven days prior to the date of such council meeting, a written notice of this intent to request such termination, and the time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published by the city clerk at least once, seven days before such meeting, in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. 
(2)	The council shall hear any persons interested therein, and shall determine, in its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause. 
(3)	If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause, as defined by the city, the council shall direct the grantee to comply within such time and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable. 
(4)	If the commission shall determine such failure, refusal, or neglect by the grantee was without just cause, then the council shall, by resolution, declare that the franchise of the grantee shall be terminated and the performance bond forfeited, unless there is compliance by the grantee within a specified period of time not to exceed 90 days, beginning from the date of such resolution. 
(e)	Disposition of facilities. In the event a franchise expires, is revoked, or otherwise terminated, the city may, in its sole discretion, do any of the following: 
(1)	Purchase the system under the procedures set forth in section 26-50. 
(2)	Effect a transfer of ownership of the system to another party. 
(3)	Order the removal of the system facilities required by public necessity from the city within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the city, or require the original grantee to maintain and operate its system for a period of six months or until such further time as is mutually agreed upon. 
(f)	Restoration of property. In removing its plant, structures and equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good a condition or better as that prevailing prior to the grantee's removal of its equipment and appliances without affecting the electrical or telephone cable wires or attachments. The city shall inspect and approve the condition of the public ways and public places and cables, wires, attachments, and poles after removal. The liability, indemnity, insurance, and performance bond as provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by the grantee with the terms and conditions of this subsection, this chapter, and the franchise. 
(g)	Restoration by city; reimbursement of costs. In the event of a failure by the grantee to complete any work required by sections 26-33 and 26-35 and/or subsection (f) above, or any other work required by city law or ordinance within the time as may be established and to the satisfaction of the city, the city may cause such work to be done and the grantee shall reimburse the city the cost thereof within 30 days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs, or the city may recover such costs through the performance bond or letter of credit provided by the grantee. The city shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this section. 
(h)	Extended operation. Upon either the expiration or revocation of a franchise, the city may require the grantee to continue to operate the system for a period of six months from the date of such expiration or revocation, or until such time as is mutually agreed upon. The grantee shall, as trustee for its successor in interest, continue to operate the cable communications system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise and to provide the regular subscriber service and any and all of the services that may be provided at the time. The city shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this section.

Sec. 26-46. - Receivership and foreclosure. 
(a)	Termination by insolvency. The franchise granted hereunder shall, at the option of the city, cease and terminate 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees to take over and conduct the business of the grantee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of such 120 days, or unless: 
(1)	Such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of this chapter and the franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the receivers or trustees, within such 120 days, shall have remedied all defaults under the franchise; and 
(2)	Such receivers or trustees shall, within such 120 days, execute an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises, whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the franchise herein granted. 
(b)	Termination by judicial action. In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the plant, property and equipment of the grantee or any part thereof (including or excluding the franchise), the city may serve notice of termination upon the grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the grantee granted hereunder shall cease and terminate 30 days after service of such notice, unless: 
(1)	The city shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, in the manner this chapter provides; and 
(2)	Such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the city to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of the franchise.

Sec. 26-50. - Rights reserved to grantor. 
(a)	Right to purchase. In accordance with the Cable Act, in the event the grantee forfeits, and the city terminates, the franchise, pursuant to provisions of this chapter and the franchise, or the franchise is not renewed at the normal expiration of the franchise term and the grantee has exhausted all rights to renewal under the Cable Act, the city shall have the right, directly or as an intermediary, to purchase the cable communications system or effect the transfer of ownership of the system to another person. In the instance of nonrenewal, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern, but with no value allocated to the franchise itself. If the franchise is revoked for cause, the acquisition or transfer shall be at an equitable price. 
(b)	Right to inspect records. Upon reasonable notice, the city shall have the right to inspect all books, records, reports, maps, plans, financial statements, and other like materials of the grantee at any time during normal business hours.

(g)	Expense reimbursement to city. The grantee shall pay the city a sum of money which will, when added to application fees received, reimburse all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with preparation of this chapter, the franchise agreements, and the grant or extension of a franchise, including but not limited to, consultant fees, attorneys' fees, publication fees, travel expenses and all other direct costs; provided, however, that the city shall submit a detailed schedule of all such costs.

(b)	Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, the grantee shall at all times comply with all laws and regulations of the local, state and federal government. In the event that any actions of the state or federal government, or any agency thereof, or any court of competent jurisdiction upon final adjudication, substantially reduce in any way the power or authority of the city under this chapter or the franchise, or, if in compliance with any local, state, or federal law or regulation, the grantee finds conflict with the terms of this chapter, the franchise, or any law or regulation of the city, then, as soon as possible following knowledge thereof, the grantee shall notify the city of the point of conflict believed to exist between such law or regulation and the laws or regulations of the city, this chapter and the franchise. The city, at its option, may notify the grantee that it wishes to negotiate those provisions which are affected in any way by such modification in regulations or statutory authority. Thereafter, the grantee shall negotiate in good faith with the city in the development of alternate provisions which shall fairly restore the city to the maximum level of authority and power permitted by law. The city shall have the right to modify any of the provisions to such reasonable extent as may be necessary to carry out the full intent and purpose of this chapter and the franchise. 
(c)	The city reserves the right to exercise the maximum plenary authority, as may at any time be lawfully permissible, to regulate the cable communications system, the franchise and the grantee. Should applicable legislative, judicial or regulatory authorities at any time permit regulation not presently permitted to the city, the city may, without the approval of the grantee, engage in any such additional regulation as may then be permissible, whether or not contemplated by this chapter or the franchise, including, without limitation, regulation regarding franchise fees, taxes, programming, rates charged to subscribers and users, consumer protection, or any other similar or dissimilar matter.

The grantee's charges and rates for all services shall be itemized on the subscriber's monthly bills. 
(c)	To the extent that federal or state law or regulation may now, or as the same may hereafter be amended to, authorize the city to regulate the rates for any particular service tiers, service packages, equipment, or any other services provided by the grantee, the city shall have the right to exercise rate regulation to the full extent authorized by law, or to refrain from exercising such regulation for any period of time, at the sole discretion of the city.

(a)	Surety instrument required. Upon the effective date of the franchise, the grantee shall obtain and maintain during the entire term of the franchise and any extensions and renewals thereof, at its cost and expense, and file with the city, a corporate surety bond or an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount specified in the franchise to guarantee the faithful performance of the grantee of all its obligations provided under this chapter and the franchise. Failure to timely obtain, file, and maintain such bond or letter of credit shall constitute a substantial violation within the meaning of this section. 
(b)	Conditions of bond. The performance bond shall provide the following conditions: 
(1)	There shall be recoverable by the city, jointly and severally, from the principal and surety, any and all fines and liquidated damages due to the city and any and all damages, losses, costs, and expenses suffered or incurred by the city resulting from the failure of the grantee to faithfully comply with the provisions of this chapter and the franchise; comply with all orders, permits and directives of any city agency or body having jurisdiction over its acts or defaults; pay fees due to the city; or pay any claims, liens or taxes due the city which arise by reason of the construction, operation, maintenance or repair of the cable system. Such losses, costs and expenses shall include, but not be limited to, attorney's fees and other associated expenses. 
(2)	The total amount of the bond shall be forfeited in favor of the city in the event: 
a.	The grantee abandons the cable system at any time during the term of the franchise or any extension thereto; or 
b.	The grantee assigns the franchise without the express written consent of the city. 
(c)	Reduction of surety instrument. Upon written application by the grantee, the city may, at its sole option, permit the amount of the bond or the letter of credit to be reduced or waive the requirements for either a performance bond or letter of credit subject to the conditions set forth below. Reductions granted or denied upon application by the grantee shall be without prejudice to the grantee's subsequent applications or to the city's right to require the full bond or letter of credit at any time thereafter; however, no application shall be made by the grantee within one year of any prior application. 
(d)	Letter of credit. If a letter of credit is required in the franchise, the grantee shall obtain, maintain and file with the city an irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution licensed to do business in the state in an amount specified in the franchise, naming the city as beneficiary. The form and contents of such letter of credit shall be approved by the city and shall be released only upon expiration of the franchise or upon the replacement of the letter of credit by a successor grantee. Failure to obtain the letter of credit within the time specified herein shall constitute a substantial violation within the meaning of this section. 
(e)	Conditions of letter of credit or bond.

(f)	Use. Prior to drawing upon the letter of credit or the performance bond for the purposes described in this section, the city shall notify the grantee in writing that a noncompliance issue has arisen that is giving the city reason to draw upon the letter of credit or performance bond. The city shall extend to the grantee a 30-day period within which the grantee may demonstrate that a violation does not exist or to cure an alleged violation, or, if the violation cannot be corrected in 60 days, to submit a plan satisfactory to the city to correct the violation or noncompliance. If a violation or noncompliance factor is proven to exist, and no cure or action on a plan acceptable to the city has been received by the city within 30 days, then the city shall notify the grantee that payment is due and the grantee shall have ten days from the receipt of such written notice to make a full and complete payment. If the grantee does not make the payment within ten days, the city may withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and penalties, from the letter of credit or the performance bond. 
(g)	Notification. Within three days of a withdrawal from the letter of credit or performance bond, the city shall send to the grantee, by certified mail, return receipt requested, written notification of the amount, date and purpose of such withdrawal. 
(h)	Replenishment. No later than 30 days after mailing to the grantee, by certified mail, notification of a withdrawal pursuant to subsection (f) above, the grantee shall replenish the letter of credit or performance bond in an amount equal to the amount so withdrawn. Failure to make timely replenishment of such amount to the letter of credit or performance bond shall constitute a material violation of this chapter. 
(i)	Nonrenewal, alteration, or cancellation.

(c)	Application of credit. Beginning with the date on which this rate rider becomes effective for the customer, a monthly credit will be determined for only the six heating months of October, November, December, January, February, and March. 
Monthly credits will accrue to a total credit that will be applied to the customer's account and shown in the customer's monthly bill for the following April. 
(d)	Calculation of credit. The KWH meter for the electric boiler will be read each month for October through March. For each of the six months a breakeven electric price will be calculated as follows: 
Breakeven electric price ($/KWH) = Published gas utility rates for service in Catawba County for the applicable month ($/mmBTU) × 1.2 (ratio of electric to gas boiler efficiencies) and divided by 292 (conversion factor for mmBTU's to KWH's), but not less than 3.0 cents per KWH. 
For each of the six months for which this rider is applicable, a monthly credit will be calculated as follows: 
Schedule "I" customers 
Monthly credit = [monthly energy usage (KWH)] × [$0.050256 - breakeven electric price] 
Schedule "G" customers 
Monthly credit = [monthly energy usage (KWH)] × [$0.050016 - breakeven electric price] 
(e)	Rate adjustments. This rate rider will be automatically adjusted for changes in the city's schedules "I" or "G" and may be adjusted or revoked by the city, acting through its city council, at any time.

(Code 1972, § 21A-4; Ord. No. 2000.30, § 4, 10-3-2000) 
Sec. 82-5. - General requirements. 
(a)	Plan required. No person shall initiate any land disturbing activity, within the corporate limits or the extraterritorial planning jurisdiction of the city, which uncovers more than one acre without having an erosion control plan approved by the city. In cases where the applicant submitting the plan is not the owner of the property, they must provide written consent from the owner to submit the plan. 
(b)	Protection of property. Persons conducting land disturbing activity shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and private property from damage caused by such activity. 
(c)	More restrictive rules shall apply. Whenever conflict exists between federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, or rules, the more restrictive provision shall apply. 
(Code 1972, § 21A-5; Ord. No. 2000.30, § 5, 10-3-2000; Ord. No. 2006.8, § 1, 3-22-2006) 
Sec. 82-6. - Basic control objectives. 
    An erosion and sedimentation control plan may be disapproved pursuant to section 82-17 if the plan fails to address the following control objectives: 
(1)	Identify critical areas. On-site areas which are subject to severe erosion, and off-site areas which are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special attention. 
(2)	Limit time of exposure. All land disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time. 
(3)	Limit exposed areas. All land disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time. 
(4)	Control surface water. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of exposure. 
(5)	Control sedimentation. All land disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted so as to prevent off-site sedimentation damage. 
(6)	Manage stormwater runoff. When the increase in the velocity of stormwater runoff resulting from a land disturbing activity is sufficient to cause accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans are to include measures to control the velocity to the point of discharge so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and increased sedimentation of the stream. 
(Code 1972, § 21A-6; Ord. No. 2000.30, § 6, 10-3-2000) 
Sec. 82-7. - Mandatory standards for land disturbing activity. 
    No land disturbing activity subject to the control of this chapter shall be undertaken except in accordance with the following mandatory standards: 
(1)	Buffer zone. 
a.	No land disturbing activity during periods of construction or improvement to land shall be permitted in proximity to a lake or natural watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided along the margin of the watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the 25 percent of the buffer zone nearest the land disturbing activity. 
b.	Unless otherwise provided, the width of a buffer zone is measured from the edge of the water to the nearest edge of the disturbed area, with the 25 percent of the strip nearer the land disturbing visible siltation. 
(2)	Graded slopes and fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no greater than the angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or other adequate erosion control devices or structures. In any event, slopes left exposed will, within 21 calendar days of completion of any phase of grading, be planted or otherwise provided with ground cover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion. 
(3)	Ground cover. Whenever land disturbing activity is undertaken on a tract comprising more than one acre, if more than one acre is uncovered, the person conducting the land disturbing activity shall install such sedimentation and erosion control devices and practices as are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of said tract, and shall plant or otherwise provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after completion of construction or development. Except as provided in section 82-8(b)(5), provisions for a ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be accomplished within 21 calendar days following completion of construction or development, whichever period is shorter. 
(4)	Prior plan approval. No person shall initiate any land disturbing activity on a tract if more than one acre is to be uncovered unless, 30 or more days prior to initiating the activity, an erosion and sedimentation control plan for such activity is filed with and approved by the city. 
(Code 1972, § 21A-7; Ord. No. 2000.30, § 7, 10-3-2000; Ord. No. 2006.8, §§ 2, 3, 3-22-2006) 
Sec. 82-8. - Design and performance standards. 
(a)	Runoff. Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) of this section, erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices shall be so planned, designed, and constructed as to provide protection from the calculated maximum peak rate of runoff from the ten-year storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the USDA, Soil Conservation Service's "National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices," or other acceptable calculation procedures. 
(b)	High quality water (HQW) zones. In high quality water (HQW) zones the following design standards shall apply: 
(1)	Uncovered areas in HQW zones shall be limited at any time to a maximum total area within the boundaries of the tract of 20 acres. Only the portion of the land disturbing activity within a HQW zone shall be governed by this section. Larger areas may be uncovered within the boundaries of the tract with the written approval of the planning director/assistant city manager or his designee. 
(2)	Erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices within HQW zones shall be so planned, designed and constructed to provide protection from the runoff of the 25-year storm which produces the maximum peak rate of runoff as calculated according to procedures in the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service's "National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices" or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of this state or the United States or any generally recognized organization or association. 
(3)	Sediment basins within HQW zones shall be designed and constructed such that the basin will have a settling efficiency of at least 70 percent for the 40 micron (0.04 mm) size soil particle transported into the basin by the runoff of that 25-year storm which produces the maximum peak rate of runoff as calculated according to procedures in the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service's "National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices" or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of this state or the United States or any generally recognized organization or association. 
(4)	Newly constructed open channels in HQW zones shall be designed and constructed with side slopes no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical if a vegetative cover is used for stabilization unless soil conditions permit a steeper slope or where the slopes are stabilized by using mechanical devices, structural devices or other acceptable ditch liners. In any event, the angle for side slopes shall be sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion. 
(5)	Ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be provided for any portion of a land disturbing activity in a HQW zone within 15 working days or 60 calendar days following completion of construction or development, whichever period is shorter. 
(c)	Fill material. Unless a permit from the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Division of Solid Waste Management, to operate a landfill is on file for the affected site, acceptable fill material shall be free of organic or other degradable materials, masonry, concrete, and brick, in sizes exceeding 12 inches, and any materials which would cause the site to be regulated as a landfill by the state. 
(Code 1972, § 21A-8; Ord. No. 2000.30, § 8, 10-3-2000) 
Sec. 82-9. - Stormwater outlet protection. 
(a)	Generally. Persons shall conduct land disturbing activity so that the post-construction velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse to the discharge point does not exceed the greater of: 
(1)	The velocity established by the table in subsection (d) of this section; or 
(2)	The velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse prior to development. 
If conditions of subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section cannot be met, then the receiving watercourse to and including the discharge point shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity anywhere the velocity exceeds the "prior to development" velocity by ten percent. 
(b)	Acceptable management measures. Measures applied alone or in combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are no objectionable secondary consequences. The city recognizes that the management of stormwater runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and bank erosion is a developing technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce successful results. Some alternatives are to: 
(1)	Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas rendered impervious, 
(2)	Avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in lieu of closed drains and high velocity paved sections, 
(3)	Provide energy dissipators at outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities to the point of discharge. These may range from simple rip-rapped sections to complex structures, 
(4)	Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving cross sections and/or providing erosion resistant lining. 
(c)	Exceptions. This rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated that stormwater discharge velocities will not create an erosion problem in the receiving watercourse. 
(d)	Maximum discharge velocity. The following is a table for maximum permissible velocity for stormwater discharges: 
Maximum 
Permissible Velocities Material F.P.S. M.P.S. Fine sand (noncolloidal) 2.5 0.8 Sandy loam (noncolloidal) 2.5 0.8 Silt loam (noncolloidal) 3.0 0.9 Ordinary firm loam 3.5 1.1 Fine gravel 5.0 1.5 Stiff clay (very colloidal) 5.0 1.5 Graded, loam to cobbles (noncolloidal) 5.0 1.5 Graded, silt to cobbles (colloidal) 5.5 1.7 Alluvial silts (noncolloidal) 3.5 1.1 Alluvial silts (colloidal) 5.0 1.5 Coarse gravel (noncolloidal) 6.0 1.8 Cobbles and shingles 5.5 1.7 Shales and hard pans 6.0 1.8  
Source: Adapted from recommendations by Special Committee on Irrigation Research, American Society of Civil Engineers, 1926, for channels with straight alignment. For sinuous channels, multiply allowable velocity by 0.95 for slightly sinuous, by 0.9 for moderately sinuous channels, and by 0.8 for highly sinuous channels. 
(Code 1972, § 21A-9; Ord. No. 2000.30, § 9, 10-3-2000) 
Sec. 82-10. - Borrow and waste areas.

The maximum civil penalty for a violation, other than a violation of a stop-work order issued under G.S. 113A-65.1, is $5,000.00. The maximum civil penalty for a violation of a stop-work order is $5,000.00. No penalty shall be assessed until the person alleged to be in violation has been notified of the violation as provided in section 82-19.

In addition, the city may assess a person a one-time civil penalty of up to $5,000.00 for the day the violation is first detected. However, no time period for compliance need be given for failure to submit an erosion control plan for approval or for obstructing, hampering or interfering with an authorized representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. Each day of continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation. 
(2)	The city council shall determine the amount of the civil penalty to be assessed under this subsection and shall notify the person who is assessed the civil penalty of the amount of the penalty and the reason for assessing the penalty. In determining the amount of the penalty, the council shall consider the degree and extent of harm caused by the violation and the cost of rectifying the damage, the amount of money the violator saved by noncompliance, whether the violation was committed willfully, and the prior record of the violator in complying or failing to comply with this chapter. The notice of assessment shall be served by any means authorized under section 82-19, and shall direct the violator to either pay the assessment or contest the assessment, within 30 days after receipt of the notice of assessment, by filing written demand for a contested case in the office of administrative hearings in accordance with G.S. ch. 150B, art. 3. A hearing on the amount of civil penalty shall be conducted by the office of administrative hearings and it shall make its recommendation to the council of the city. The city council shall render its final decision on the civil penalty in accordance with G.S. ch. 150B, arts. 3 and 4. Appeal from the final decision of the council shall be to the Superior Court of Catawba County. Such appeals must be made within 30 days of the final decision of the city council. 
(3)	If payment is not received within 30 days after demand for payment is made, the city may institute a civil action to recover the amount of the assessment. The civil action may be brought in the Superior Court of Catawba County or the county where violator's residence or principal place of business is located. Such civil actions must be filed within three years of the date the assessment was due. An assessment that is not contested is due when the violator is served with a notice of assessment. An assessment that is contested is due at the conclusion of the administrative and judicial review of the assessment. 
(4)	Civil penalties collected pursuant to this chapter shall be credited to the civil penalty and forfeiture fund. 
(b)	Criminal penalties. Any person who knowingly or willfully violates any provision of this chapter, or rule or order adopted or issued pursuant to this chapter, or who knowingly or willfully initiates or continues a land disturbing activity for which an erosion control plan is required except in accordance with the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved plan, shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor which may include a fine not to exceed $5,000.00.

The action shall be brought in the Superior Court of Catawba County. 
(b)	Upon determination by a court that an alleged violation is occurring or is threatened, the court shall enter any order or judgment that is necessary to abate the violation, to ensure that restoration is performed, or to prevent the threatened violation. The institution of an action for injunctive relief under this section shall not relieve any party to the proceedings from any civil or criminal penalty prescribed for violations of this chapter. 
(Code 1972, § 21A-21; Ord. No. 2000.30, § 21, 10-3-2000; Ord. No. 2002.31, 8-21-2002) 
Sec. 82-22. - Restoration of areas affected by failure to comply. 
    The city may require a person who engaged in a land disturbing activity and failed to retain sediment generated by the activity, as required by G.S. 113A-57(3), to restore the waters and land affected by the failure so as to minimize the detrimental effects of the resulting pollution by sedimentation.

Chapter 87 - STORMWATER 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 87-1. - Title. 
    This chapter may be referred to and cited as the "Newton Stormwater Ordinance." It is referred to herein as "this chapter." 
(Ord. No. 2007.16, § 1, 6-19-2007) 
Sec. 87-2. - Authority. 
    The Newton City Council is authorized to adopt this chapter pursuant to North Carolina law, including but not limited to Article 14, Section 5 of the Constitution of North Carolina; The Charter of the City of Newton; North Carolina General Statutes 143-214.7 and rules promulgated by the Environmental Management Commission thereunder; Session Law 2004-163; Chapter 160A, § 174, 185, Chapter 113A, Article 4 (Sedimentation Pollution Control); Article 21, Part 6 (Floodway Regulation); Chapter 160A, Article 19 (Planning and Regulation of Development); and Chapter 153A, Article 18. 
(Ord. No. 2007.16, § 1, 6-19-2007) 
Sec. 87-3. - Findings. 
    It is hereby determined that: 
    Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge; 
    These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment; and 
    These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development and redevelopment sites. 
    Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 ("Clean Water Act") and Federal Phase II Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission promulgated in response to Federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas, including the City of Newton, to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this chapter. 
    Therefore, the Newton City Council establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge. 
(Ord. No. 2007.16, § 1, 6-19-2007) 
Sec. 87-4. - Purpose. 
(a)	General. The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and non-point and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of construction-related and post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure; safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare; and protect water and aquatic resources. 
(b)	Specific. This chapter seeks to meet its general purpose through the following specific objectives and means: 
(1)	Establishing decision-making processes for development that protect the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)	Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, non-point and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)	Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)	Establishing design and review criteria for the construction, function, and use of structural stormwater best management practices (BMPs) that may be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
(5)	Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices, such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of greenspace, riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable; 
(6)	Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no threat to public safety; 
(7)	Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, for the inspection of approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance. 
(8)	Coordinating site design plans that include open space and natural areas with applicable land development plans which have been adopted by the Newton City Council. 
(9)	Controlling illicit discharges into the municipal separate stormwater system.

Sec. 87-7. - Definitions. 
    When used in this chapter, the following words and terms shall have the meaning set forth in this section, unless other provisions of this chapter specifically indicate otherwise. 
    Built-upon area (BUA) means a portion of a development project that is covered by impervious or partially impervious surface including, but not limited to, buildings; pavement and gravel areas such as roads, parking lots, and paths; and recreation facilities such as tennis courts. "Built-upon area" does not include a wooden slatted deck, the water area of a swimming pool, or pervious or partially pervious paving material to the extent that the paving material absorbs water or allows water to infiltrate through the paving material. 
    Department means the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 
    Design manual means the stormwater design manual approved for use in Phase II jurisdictions by the department for the proper implementation of the requirements of the federal Phase II stormwater program. All references herein to the design manual are to the latest published edition or revision. 
    Development means any land-disturbing activity that increases the amount of built-upon area or that otherwise decreases the infiltration of precipitation into the soil. 
    Division means the division of water quality in the department. 
    High-density project means any project that exceeds the low-density threshold for dwelling units per acre or built-upon area. 
    Larger common plan of development or sale means any area where multiple separate and distinct construction or land-disturbing activities will occur under one plan. A plan is any announcement or piece of documentation (including but not limited to a sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch, advertisement, loan application, drawing, permit application, zoning request, or computer design) or physical demarcation (including but not limited to boundary signs, lot stakes, or surveyor markings) indicating that construction activities may occur on a specific plot. 
    Low-density project means a project is considered a low-density project if it has no more than two dwelling units per acre or 24 percent built-upon area (BUA) for all residential and non-residential development. 
    A project with an overall density at or below the relevant low-density threshold, but containing areas with a density greater than the overall project density, may be considered low density as long as the project meets or exceeds the post-construction model practices for low-density projects and locates the higher density in upland areas and away from surface waters and drainageways to the maximum extent practicable. 
    1-Year, 24-Hour Storm means the surface runoff resulting from a 24-hour rainfall of an intensity expected to be equaled or exceeded, on average, once in 12 months and with a duration of 24 hours. 
    Owner means the legal or beneficial owner of land, including but not limited to a mortgagee or vendee in possession, receiver, executor, trustee, or long-term or commercial lessee, or any other person or entity holding proprietary rights in the property or having legal power of management and control of the property. "Owner" shall include long-term commercial tenants; management entities, such as those charged with or engaged in the management of properties for profit; and every person or entity having joint ownership of the property. A secured lender not in possession of the property does not constitute an owner, unless the secured lender is included within the meaning of "owner" under another description in this definition, such as a management entity. 
    Redevelopment means any development on previously-developed land, other than a rebuilding activity that results in no net increase in built-upon area and provides equal or greater stormwater control than the previous development. 
    Structural BMP means a physical device designed to trap, settle out, or filter pollutants from stormwater runoff; to alter or reduce stormwater runoff velocity, amount, timing, or other characteristics; to approximate the predevelopment hydrology on a developed site; or to achieve any combination of these goals. Structural BMP includes physical practices such as constructed wetlands, vegetative practices, filter strips, grassed swales, and other methods installed or created on real property. "Structural BMP" is synonymous with "structural practice," "stormwater control facility," "stormwater control practice," "stormwater treatment practice," "stormwater management practice," "stormwater control measures," "structural stormwater treatment systems," and similar terms used in this chapter. 
    Substantial progress means for the purposes of determining whether sufficient progress has been made on an approved plan, one or more of the following construction activities toward the completion of a site or subdivision plan shall occur: obtaining a soil erosion permit and conducting grading activity on a continuous basis and not discontinued for more than thirty (30) days; or installation and approval of on-site infrastructure; or obtaining a building permit for the construction and approval of a building foundation. "Substantial progress" for purposes of determining whether an approved plan is null and void is not necessarily the same as "substantial expenditures" used for determining vested rights pursuant to applicable law.

(Ord. No. 2007.16, § 1, 6-19-2007) 
Sec. 87-14. - Applications for approval. 
(a)	Concept plan and consultation meeting. Before a stormwater management permit application is deemed complete, the stormwater administrator or developer may request a consultation on a concept plan for the post-construction stormwater management system to be utilized in the proposed development project. This consultation meeting should take place at the time of the preliminary plan of subdivision or other early step in the development process. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the post-construction stormwater management measures necessary for the proposed project, as well as to discuss and assess constraints, opportunities and potential approaches to stormwater management designs before formal site design engineering is commenced. Local watershed plans and other relevant resource protection plans, such as but not limited to land development plans, small area plans and park and open space plans should be consulted in the discussion of the concept plan. 
To accomplish this goal, the following information should be included in the concept plan, which should be submitted in advance of the meeting: 
(1)	Existing conditions/proposed site plans. Existing conditions and proposed site layout sketch plans, which illustrate at a minimum existing and proposed topography; perennial and intermittent streams; mapping of predominant soils from soil surveys (if available); boundaries of existing predominant vegetation; proposed limits of clearing and grading; and location of existing and proposed roads, buildings, parking areas and other impervious surfaces. 
(2)	Natural resources inventory. A written or graphic inventory of natural resources at the site and surrounding area as it exists prior to the commencement of the project. This description should include a discussion of soil conditions, forest cover, geologic features, topography, wetlands, and native vegetative areas on the site, as well as the location and boundaries of other natural feature protection and conservation areas such as lakes, ponds, floodplains, stream buffers and other setbacks (e.g., drinking water well setbacks, septic setbacks, etc.). Particular attention should be paid to environmentally sensitive features that provide particular opportunities or constraints for development and stormwater management. 
(3)	Stormwater management system concept plan. A written or graphic concept plan of the proposed post-development stormwater management system including: preliminary selection and location of proposed structural stormwater controls; low-impact design elements; location of existing and proposed conveyance systems such as grass channels, swales, and storm drains; flow paths; location of floodplain/floodway limits; relationship of site to upstream and downstream properties and drainages; and preliminary location of any proposed stream channel modifications, such as bridge or culvert crossings. 
(b)	Stormwater management permit application. The stormwater management permit application shall detail how post-development stormwater runoff will be controlled and managed and how the proposed project will meet the requirements of this chapter, including article II, standards. All such plans shall be prepared by a qualified registered North Carolina professional engineer, surveyor, soil scientist, or landscape architect, and the engineer, surveyor, soil scientist, or landscape architect shall perform services only in their area of competence, and shall verify that the design of all stormwater management facilities and practices meets the submittal requirements for complete applications, that the designs and plans are sufficient to comply with applicable standards and policies found in the design manual, and that the designs and plans ensure compliance with this chapter. 
The submittal shall include all of the information required in the submittal checklist established by the stormwater administrator. Incomplete submittals shall be treated pursuant to section 73-12(e). 
(c)	As-built plans and final approval. Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted, the applicant shall certify that the completed project is in accordance with the approved stormwater management plans and designs, and shall submit actual "as built" plans for all stormwater management facilities or practices after final construction is completed. 
The plans shall show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and practices and the field location, size, depth, and planted vegetation of all measures, controls, and devices, as installed. The designer of the stormwater management measures and plans shall certify, under seal, that the as-built stormwater measures, controls, and devices are in compliance with the approved stormwater management plans and designs and with the requirements of this chapter. A final inspection and approval by the stormwater administrator shall occur before the release of any performance securities. 
(d)	Other permits. No certificate of compliance or occupancy shall be issued by the city or the county building inspections department without final as-built plans and a final inspection and approval by the stormwater administrator, except where multiple units are served by the stormwater practice or facilities, in which case the city may elect to withhold a percentage of permits or certificates of occupancy until as-built plans are submitted and final inspection and approval has occurred. 
(Ord. No. 2007.16, § 1, 6-19-2007) 
Sec. 87-15. - Approvals. 
(a)	Effect of approval. Approval authorizes the applicant to go forward with only the specific plans and activities authorized in the permit. The approval shall not be construed to exempt the applicant from obtaining other applicable approvals from local, state, and federal authorities. 
(b)	Time limit/expiration. An approved plan shall become null and void if the applicant fails to make substantial progress on the site within one year after the date of approval. The stormwater administrator may grant a single, one-year extension of this time limit, for good cause shown, upon receiving a written request from the applicant before the expiration of the approved plan. 
In granting an extension, the stormwater administrator may require compliance with standards adopted since the original application was submitted unless there has been substantial reliance on the original permit and the change in standards would infringe the applicant's vested rights. 
(Ord. No. 2007.16, § 1, 6-19-2007) 
Sec. 87-16. - Appeals.

(Ord. No. 2007.16, § 1, 6-19-2007) 
Sec. 87-24. - Operation and maintenance agreement. 
(a)	In general. Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or building site to be served by a structural BMP pursuant to this chapter, and prior to issuance of any permit for development or redevelopment requiring a structural BMP pursuant to this chapter, the applicant or owner of the site must execute an operation and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of the site, portions of the site, and lots or parcels served by the structural BMP. Until the transference of all property, sites, or lots served by the structural BMP, the original owner or applicant shall have primary responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the maintenance agreement. 
The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner or owners to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the structural BMP, and shall state the terms, conditions, and schedule of maintenance for the structural BMP. In addition, it shall grant to City of Newton a right of entry in the event that the stormwater administrator has reason to believe it has become necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the structural BMP; however, in no case shall the right of entry, of itself, confer an obligation on City of Newton to assume responsibility for the structural BMP. 
The operation and maintenance agreement must be approved by the stormwater administrator prior to plan approval, and it shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with the county register of deeds upon final plat approval. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall be recorded at the same time as the Final Plat by the City of Newton. 
(b)	Special requirement for homeowners' and other associations. For all structural BMPs required pursuant to this chapter and that are to be or are owned and maintained by a homeowners' association, property owners' association, or similar entity, the required operation and maintenance agreement shall include all of the following provisions: 
(1)	Acknowledgement that the association shall continuously operate and maintain the stormwater control and management facilities. 
(2)	Establishment of an escrow account, which can be spent solely for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, or reconstruction of the structural BMPs. If structural BMPs are not performing adequately or as intended or are not properly maintained, the City of Newton, in its sole discretion, may remedy the situation, and in such instances the City of Newton shall be fully reimbursed from the escrow account. Escrowed funds may be spent by the association and its members for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, and reconstruction of the structural BMPs, provided that the City of Newton shall first consent to the expenditure. 
(3)	Both developer contribution and annual sinking funds shall fund the escrow account. Prior to plat recordation or issuance of construction permits, whichever shall first occur, the developer shall pay into the escrow account an amount equal to 15 percent of the initial construction cost of the structural BMPs. Two-thirds of the total amount of sinking fund budget shall be deposited into the escrow account within the first five years and the full amount shall be deposited within ten years following initial construction of the structural BMPs. Funds shall be deposited each year into the escrow account. A portion of the annual assessments of the association shall include an allocation into the escrow account. Any funds drawn down from the escrow account shall be replaced in accordance with the schedule of anticipated work used to create the sinking fund budget. 
(4)	The percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to fund the escrow account may be varied by the City of Newton depending on the design and materials of the stormwater control and management facility. 
(5)	Granting to the City of Newton a right of entry to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, and reconstruct structural BMPs. 
(6)	Allowing the City of Newton to recover from the association and its members any and all costs the City of Newton expends to maintain or repair the structural BMPs or to correct any operational deficiencies. Failure to pay the City of Newton all of its expended costs, after 45 days written notice, shall constitute a breach of the agreement. In case of a deficiency, the City of Newton shall thereafter be entitled to bring an action against the association and its members to pay, or foreclose upon the lien hereby authorized by the agreement against the property, or both. Interest, collection costs, and attorney fees shall be added to the recovery. 
(7)	A statement that this agreement shall not obligate the City of Newton to maintain or repair any structural BMPs, and the City of Newton shall not be liable to any person for the condition or operation of structural BMPs. 
(8)	A statement that this agreement shall not in any way diminish, limit, or restrict the right of the City of Newton to enforce any of its ordinances as authorized by law. 
(9)	A provision indemnifying and holding harmless the City of Newton for any costs and injuries arising from or related to the structural BMP, unless the City of Newton has agreed in writing to assume the maintenance responsibility for the BMP and has accepted dedication of any and all rights necessary to carry out that maintenance.

A person who receives a notice of violation and correction order, or the owner of the land on which the violation occurs, may submit to the stormwater administrator a written request for an extension of time for correction of the violation. On determining that the request includes enough information to show that the violation cannot be corrected within the specified time limit for reasons beyond the control of the person requesting the extension, the stormwater administrator may extend the time limit as is reasonably necessary to allow timely correction of the violation, up to, but not exceeding 30 days. The stormwater administrator may grant 15 day extensions in addition to the foregoing extension if the violation cannot be corrected within the permitted time due to circumstances beyond the control of the person violating this chapter.

Any person so ordered shall cease any violation immediately. The stormwater administrator may seek immediate enforcement, without prior written notice, through any remedy or penalty authorized by this article.

(b)	In the interpretation of subsection (a)(1) of this section, the term "previously platted" shall mean platted, approved and recorded, if such lots were created in accordance with subdivision regulations in effect at the time of their creation, or created as a result of a recorded land division prior to existence of applicable subdivision regulations. 
(c)	In the interpretation of subsections (a)(2) and (4) of this section, the phrase "where no street right-of-way dedication is involved" shall be construed as meaning that any such parcel shall be served by an existing street which has been accepted for dedication and maintenance by the city or the state department of transportation. 
(Code 1972, § 23-2; Ord. No. 89.36, § 1) 
Sec. 90-3. - Lots created contrary to subdivision regulations. 
    Any lot created in a manner contrary to the subdivision regulations in effect at the time of its creation, whether or not the instrument creating such lot was recorded, shall not be sold, offered for sale, used, occupied or recorded, if previously unrecorded, until such lot shall have city approval as being in accordance with the subdivision regulations currently in effect. 
(Code 1972, § 23-3; Ord. No. 89.36, § 1) 
Sec. 90-4. - Adjustments to lot boundaries not constituting subdivisions. 
    Adjustments to boundaries of lots which do not constitute a subdivision, as defined in section 90-2, shall be permitted only upon certification by the city planning director that the proposed adjustments shall not cause a violation of this chapter or the zoning ordinance of the city. 
(Code 1972, § 23-4; Ord. No. 89.36, § 1) 
Sec. 90-5. - Suitability of lots for uses intended.

(b)	Applications for subdivision approval shall be considered in relation to all such regulations applicable in the particular case, and not only in relation to the subdivision regulations set forth herein. Where there are conflicts between these and other lawfully adopted regulations involved in such considerations, those which establish the highest requirements or most stringent limitations shall govern, except where specific exceptions are set forth in such regulations.

The owner or agent of the owner of any land to be subdivided within the area of jurisdiction of this chapter, who transfers or sells or agrees to sell or negotiate to sell such land by reference to or exhibition of or by any other use of a plat of a subdivision of such land, before such plat has been approved by the city and recorded by the register of deeds, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Upon conviction thereof, he shall be punished as provided by article II, division 3 of this chapter. The description of metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties. Such transfer, sale or agreement may be enjoined by appropriate action. 
(c)	Effect of plat approval on status of dedication. The approval of a plat shall not be deemed to constitute or effect an acceptance by the city or the public of the dedication of any street or other ground shown upon the plat. Acceptance of such dedications within the city shall be only by resolution of the council. It shall consider such resolutions only on determination that any required improvements have been properly installed and all applicable conditions met, as set out in articles V and VI of this chapter. 
(d)	Effect of chapter on erection of structures. From and after the time the ordinance from which this chapter is derived becomes effective, no building permit shall be issued for, and no structure shall be erected on, any lot, unless the street giving access to the lot upon which the structure is proposed to be placed: 
(1)	Has been accepted or opened as, or otherwise has received the legal status of, a public street prior to that time; or 
(2)	Corresponds in its locations and lines with a street shown on a subdivision plat approved by the city or on an official map adopted by the planning commission and the council, or with a street located and accepted by the council. 
Any structure erected in violation of this section shall be deemed an unlawful structure, and the building official or other official designated by the council may bring appropriate action to enjoin such erection or cause the structure to be vacated or removed. 
(e)	Effect of chapter on naming of streets. From and after the time the ordinance from which this chapter is derived becomes effective, the council shall, by proper certificate, approve and authorize the name of any street or road laid out within the territory over which it has jurisdiction.

Any person violating this provision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished as provided by article II, division 3 of this chapter.

The chairman shall notify the applicant by first class mail to the address required in section 90-121 of the approval and the time of filing of the plat for record. 
(Code 1972, § 23-11; Ord. No. 89.36, § 1) 
Sec. 90-124. - Time limit for final approval of preliminary plats. 
(a)	The time limit for final approval of preliminary plats shall be one year from the date of application, subject to extensions for periods not exceeding one year on application and on findings by the SRB that good cause exists; provided, that the total cumulative term of such approval shall not exceed four years. Such limits shall expire automatically unless extended. 
(b)	In addition, after a hearing, any extension may be terminated by action of the SRB upon finding that good cause exists. In such cases, notice of intent to terminate shall be sent to holders of such extensions not less than ten calendar days before termination action is taken, and notice of termination shall be sent within five calendar days of such action.

DIVISION 3. - MINOR SUBDIVISIONS AND LANDLOCKED SUBDIVISIONS 

Sec. 90-141. - Generally. 
(a)	Procedures set forth herein for handling applications for approval of minor and landlocked subdivisions are intended to simplify processing of routine small subdivisions, with due regard to protection of public interest. Some flexibility is allowed as to submissions and processing. 
(b)	The main difference in processing shall be the ability of an applicant to avoid the need to seek, for a minor or landlocked subdivision, approval of a preliminary plat. The applicant may apply directly for approval of a final plat. However, the SRB shall require the submission of a sketch plan for review by the director of planning. 
(Code 1972, § 23-14; Ord. No. 89.36, § 1; Ord. No. 99.35, § 1, 4-21-1999) 
Sec. 90-142. - Definitions. 
(a)	Minor subdivision. For the purposes of this chapter, a "minor subdivision" is defined as a subdivision: 
(1)	Creating not more than four lots fronting on an existing public street; 
(2)	Not creating any new street or prospectively requiring any new street for access to interior property; 
(3)	Not requiring extension of public sewerage or water lines or creation of new drainage through lots to serve property at the rear; 
(4)	Not adversely affecting the development of the remainder of the parcel or of adjoining property; and 
(5)	Creating no new or residual parcels not conforming to the requirements of this chapter and related controls. 
For the purposes of subsection (1) above, "public street" shall mean that any such parcel shall be served by an existing street which has been accepted for dedication and maintenance by the city or state department of transportation. 
(b)	Landlocked subdivision. For the purposes of this chapter, a "landlocked subdivision" is defined as a subdivision creating not more than one additional lot from a tract or parcel (which was not itself created by or the residue of a previously recorded subdivision), where the tract or parcel either abuts a neighborhood public road as defined in G.S. 136-67, a municipal neighborhood public road as defined in chapter 102, Zoning, or a private easement which provides the tract or parcel and the additionally created lot access to either of the above mentioned roads or to a public street as defined in this chapter. 
(Code 1972, § 23-15; Ord. No. 89.36, § 1; Ord. No. 99.35, § 2, 4-21-1999) 
Sec. 90-143. - Findings required. 
(a)	Minor subdivisions. Departmental reports and recommendations for minor subdivisions shall include findings as to whether: 
(1)	The application and plat indicates not more than four lots fronting on existing approved streets; 
(2)	New or residual parcels will conform to the requirements of this chapter and other applicable controls; 
(3)	Any new street is required, or is likely to be required, for access to interior property; 
(4)	Any drainage and utilities easements will be required to serve interior property; 
(5)	Any extension of public sewerage or water lines will be required; 
(6)	The proposed subdivision will adversely effect permissible development of the remainder of the parcel or of adjoining property; 
(7)	Appropriate right-of-way for widening has been offered for dedication where the lots front on an existing approved street indicated in the official major street plan as intended for widening. In general, such right-of-way offered for dedication shall be adjacent to the existing right-of-way, and of such width as to provide a total of half of the projected right-of-way width indicated on the street plan as measured from the center of the existing street; provided, that in cases of projected changes in the alignment of the centerline, greater or lesser amounts may be required as appropriate. In no case shall right-of-way offered for dedication for such purposes be required to be more than an average of 25 feet in width; and 
(8)	Drainage easements have been provided to continue, provide for or enlarge roadside drainage systems where needed and where such drainage is not to be provided in whole or in part in the right-of-way widening described above. 
(b)	Landlocked subdivisions. Departmental reports and recommendations for landlocked subdivisions shall include findings as to whether: 
(1)	The application and plat indicates not more than one additional lot being created from a tract or parcel which abuts a neighborhood public road, a municipal neighborhood public road as defined by zoning ordinance or a private easement either of which provides the tract or parcel and the additionally created lot with access to either of the above type of neighborhood road or to a public street as defined in this chapter. 
(2)	The tract or parcel to be subdivided is not a part of or the result of a previously recorded subdivision. 
(3)	The additional lot to be created shall abut either of the types of neighborhood public roads mentioned above, or new private easement. Said new private easement shall have a minimum width of 50 feet of right-of-way for ingress and egress, utility and street improvements and shall specify who the responsible party or parties are for maintenance purposes. A statement on the plat to be recorded shall indicate who shall have responsibility for easement maintenance.

ARTICLE IV. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 90-171. - Streets and alleys. 
(a)	Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter, terms relating to streets and alleys are defined as follows: 
    Alleys means minor ways used primarily for vehicular access to the rear or side of properties otherwise abutting a street at the front. 
    Arterial streets or major thoroughfares means those used primarily for through traffic, usually on a continuous route. For the purposes of this chapter, such streets include those so designated in any officially adopted thoroughfare plan or element thereof. 
    Collector streets or minor thoroughfares means those used to carry traffic from minor streets to arterial streets. For the purposes of this chapter, such streets include those designated as collectors in the officially adopted thoroughfare plan or element thereof. 
    Cul-de-sac streets means dead-end streets, having the same entrance and exit and requiring facilities for traffic to turn around. 
    Limited access streets means those to and from which access of adjoining property is not direct, but is combined, limited, channeled or prohibited. Marginal access streets, as defined above, are one means for limiting and controlling access to arterial streets, usually combining entrances along a single block face. 
    Loop streets provide a means for local traffic to leave and enter other streets without turning around, but provide access only to properties directly served. 
    Minor or local streets means streets, other than arterial or collector, used primarily to provide access to abutting properties. The term includes marginal access streets, which are generally parallel and adjacent to arterial streets and serve abutting properties and provide protection from friction with through traffic. 
    Public street means a street which has been accepted for permanent maintenance by either the state or the city. 
    Street means a vehicular way, which may also serve in part as a way for pedestrian traffic, whether called street, highway, thoroughfare, parkway, throughway, road, avenue, boulevard, lane, place, alley, mall or otherwise. 
(b)	Conformance with thoroughfare and land development plans. Arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the officially adopted Hickory-Newton-Conover Urban Area Thoroughfare Plan and the adopted Land Development Plan, Collector Street Plan, or elements thereof, and shall be considered in relation to existing and proposed transportation patterns; topographic and other natural features; public convenience and safety; and appropriate relation to proposed uses of land to be served by such streets and existing or potential land uses in adjoining areas. 
(c)	Other design standards. The following design standards shall apply to all streets proposed in subdivisions: 
(1)	Continuation or projection of arterial and collector streets. Within or adjacent to subdivisions, arterial and collector streets shall provide for continuation of arterial or collector traffic flow from surrounding areas, except where topographic or other conditions make such continuance or projection unnecessary, impracticable or undesirable. 
(2)	Minor streets in residential neighborhoods. Minor streets within or adjacent to subdivisions in residential neighborhoods shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic shall be discouraged. 
(3)	Subdivisions bordering or containing existing or proposed streets, etc. Where subdivisions border or contain existing or proposed arterial or collector streets or railroad rights-of-way, the subdivision review board (SRB) may require: 
a.	Marginal access streets; 
b.	Screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along property lines adjoining such streets or railroad rights-of-way; 
c.	Lots of extraordinary depth and width; or 
d.	Provisions of minor streets and platting of lots in a pattern which inhibits direct access from lots to such streets, reduces marginal traffic friction and traffic hazards and protects occupants of lots adjacent to arterial or collector streets and railroads from noise, lights and other adverse effects. 
The SRB may require such other treatment or design as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential or other properties and separation of local and through traffic. In the case of limited access highways and railroads, existing or proposed, such requirements may include arrangements of lots or streets and land uses which will provide for future approach grades and grade separations. 
(4)	Reserve strips or nonaccess reservations. Reserve strips or nonaccess reservations, of the nature described above or other, controlling access to streets, waterways, parks or the like, shall be permitted by the SRB only if their purpose, location, dimensions and manner of control are approved by the SRB. 
(5)	Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet are not permitted. 
(6)	Street intersections generally. Street intersections shall not include more than four street approaches. 
(7)	Intersection angles generally. Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. No street shall intersect another at less than 60 degrees; provided, that other arrangements for smooth merging of traffic shall be permitted where total effect on the intersection is to reduce traffic hazards and provide for smooth traffic flow at the intersection as a whole. (As an example, where a one-way street leaves or enters a street divided by a median strip or otherwise controlled to prevent left turns, the angle of departure or entry might be less than 60 degrees.) 
(8)	Tangent at reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. A tangent of at least 100 feet in length shall normally be introduced between reverse curves on arterial or collector streets. 
(9)	Curve radius at deflecting street lines. When connecting street lines deflect from each other, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius of not less than 150 feet for minor streets, and for other streets by a curve with a centerline radius sufficient to insure a slight distance and adequate for visibility and safety, considering the character of the street and the types and speed of traffic anticipated, as set forth in the Manual of City Specifications, but in no case shall such radius be less than 200 feet. 
(10)	Property line radii at intersections. Property lines at intersections shall be rounded with the following minimum radii: 
a.	Minor streets with minor streets: 20 feet. 
b.	Alleys with any streets: 20 feet. 
c.	All other intersections: 25 feet. 
Where streets intersect at an acute angle, greater radii shall be provided. 
(11)	Right-of-way and paving widths. Street right-of-way and paving widths shall be as specified in Table I. 
(12)	Private minor streets. In planned developments, established under the terms of the zoning ordinance, private minor streets providing sole or primary access to one or more lots are permitted only if all of the following requirements are met: 
a.	Such street shall be a cul-de-sac, limited as provided in subsection (14) of this subsection, and shall not be so designed, constructed or extended as to permit service or potential service to more than ten dwelling units (considering additions on vacant lots, or replatting to create additional lots of minimum size permissible). 
b.	Minimum width of the easement for such street shall be 40 feet; additional width may be required if necessary for drainage or installation and servicing of utilities outside the area of the driving surface. 
c.	Design, location and improvement shall provide for safe intersection with public streets, safe passage of public service and emergency vehicles and protection of adjoining property. 
d.	Agreements satisfactory to the city manager, as agent for the council, are made for continuing common use of the private street by occupants of the property served, drainage, access easements for public service and emergency vehicles and continuing private maintenance in condition for safe passage of public service and emergency vehicles. There shall be a recorded agreement, contained in the deed restrictions for the development, that unless the street is privately maintained in condition for safe passage of such vehicles, the city may provide such maintenance, with charges therefor becoming a lien on the properties served, divided among them proportionate to their assessed tax valuation. 
(13)	Half streets along property lines. Half streets along property lines shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in relation to surrounding property in conformity with other requirements of this chapter and other regulations concerning land development or use, and where the SRB finds it practicable to require dedication of the other half when adjoining property is subdivided. Where a half street already exists adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted within such tract at the time of its subdivision. 
(14)	Cul-de-sac streets. 
a.	Maximum length. Cul-de-sac streets, designed to be so permanently, shall not exceed 750 feet in length, except where unusual land configuration requires otherwise. 
b.	Turnaround. All such cul-de-sac streets shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround of minimum paved surface dimensions as indicated below in figure 4-1, and where lengths of over 750 feet are permitted by the SRB, the SRB may require additional turnarounds of suitable dimensions, at intermediate locations and wider pavement requirements. 
1.	Circular turnaround.: Minimum right-of-way radius, 55 feet, and outer-edge road surface radius, 48 feet. 
2.	"Y" or "T" turnaround. Distance between the ends of the arms shall not be less than 80 feet and no more than 120 feet as measured along the centerline of the arms. The length of the arms shall be 60 feet in length with a minimum road surface width of 20 feet. Property lines at the intersection of such arms with the street shall be rounded to a radius of 20 feet in the case of a "T", and a similar rounding shall be provided at the intersection of the arms opposite the centerline of the street in the case of a "Y". Both "Y" or "T" turnaround[s] are generally permissible only where a cul-de-sac serves 20 dwelling units or less. 

(15)	Speed limits. Unless otherwise determined by the city council, speed limits in all subdivisions shall be 35 mph. Upon request or at its own discretion, the city council by adoption of an ordinance may designate a different speed limit.

    *In cases where more than 80-foot of right-of-way is desired, the applicant shall be required to reserve the amount of right-of-way in excess of 80 feet for a period of 18 months from the date of approval of the preliminary plat. During that period, the state or the city shall acquire the reserved property. 
(Code 1972, § 23-19; Ord. No. 89.36, § 1; Ord. No. 2002.31, 8-21-2002; Ord. No. 2004.38, § 1, 11-17-2004; Ord. No. 2011-5, § 1, 3-1-2011) 
Sec. 90-172. - Easements for utilities; minor drainage easements. 
(a)	Utilities easements. Easements for utilities shall be provided as determined by the public works director along front, rear or side lot lines, but shall not be required to center on such lines. Such easements shall be sufficiently wide to provide for installation of such utilities and access for maintenance and operation. 
(b)	Minor drainage easements. For the purposes of this chapter, "minor drainage easements" are defined as providing for drainage of surface waters from four or fewer lots, and not involving water bodies of substantial significance in the ecology of the area, as hereinafter described. Minor drainage easements, where required, shall be permitted to cross lots at other points only where such arrangement is found by the director of public works to be practically necessary as a result of topography or soil conditions or improved flow, and where such arrangement will leave a suitable buildable area, safe from inundation, erosion or subsidence and safely accessible from approved streets. Where necessary for operation, construction or maintenance, the director of public works may require, in accord with the terms of the easement, minor drainage easements to be cleared or kept free of undergrowth, trees and other obstructions. 
(c)	Utilities in drainage easements. Utilities in drainage easements shall be permitted only upon specific authorization by the director of public works, and only in locations authorized. 
(Code 1972, § 23-20; Ord. No. 89.36, § 1) 
Sec. 90-173. - Preservation of natural water areas; drainageways and water retention; protection from flooding. 
(a)	Intent. It is the intent of this chapter both to safeguard existing and potential development in appropriate locations and to preserve and promote a desirable ecological balance. Insofar as is reasonably practicable, subdivisions shall, therefore, be located, designed and improved to preserve important natural water areas and related vegetation and wildlife habitats, to avoid creation of upstream impoundments or downstream runoff harmful to such complexes, or to existing or potential development in appropriate locations, and to maintain desirable groundwater levels. 
(b)	Maintenance of natural waterways and water areas. Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by or includes, in whole or in part, a watercourse, marsh, pond or lake which is of substantial significance in the ecology of the general area, such water body shall, to the maximum extent reasonably feasible, be maintained in its natural state, together with bordering lands likely to be inundated at the period of high water during periods of rainfall of ten-year return frequency and other suitable protective strips. In such cases, the SRB, as a condition for plat approval, may make such requirements as are reasonable for the protection of such areas, including the following: 
(1)	The SRB may require that streets and/or parkways shall border such areas, setting them apart from residential or other intensive uses; or 
(2)	The SRB may require that all or part of such area shall be platted as part of residential or other lots. 
In making decisions concerning such requirements, the board shall consider topography, drainage patterns, soil types, character of existing and potential upland uses, ground cover, erosion control requirements, character of area to be protected, the adequacy of proposed filter areas and the like. Where all or a part of such areas is set aside for common use and enjoyment of occupants of the subdivision, arrangements for maintenance by a homeowners' association or management group or other arrangement may be acceptable, if required by the recorded deed restrictions for the development. 
(c)	Changes in location or extent of significant natural waterways and water areas. The SRB may permit changes in the location or extent of significant natural waterways and/or water areas only after findings, based upon reports and recommendations using the factors enumerated in subsection (b) of this section, that such changes will not adversely effect desirable ecological conditions, drainage or water retention or result in undesirable location or amount of upstream impoundment or downstream discharge. 
(d)	Major new drainageways. Where major new drainageways are required, they shall be coordinated with existing and proposed general drainage systems and designed with due regard for safety, appearance and geological effects. Aboveground drainageways shall be located and constructed to maintain a natural appearance, shall be limited to safe water depths in easily accessible areas and shall be designed to avoid excessive rates of flow, erosion or overflow into developed areas subject to damage. In circumstances where the impact of new drainage would be likely to damage or destroy significant existing natural water areas, as described in subsection (b) of this section, such drainage shall not be discharged through or into such areas. 
(e)	Protection from flooding and other adverse water conditions. No subdivision shall be so located or improved as to create impoundments of surface water on developable upstream lands outside the subdivision or to increase surface drainage flow across developable downstream lands other than in approved drainageways; to cause erosion on or to neighboring property or into water areas; or to raise or lower groundwater levels in a manner which creates adverse effects within the subdivision or in surrounding areas. Where location of improvements appears likely to have such effects, plats shall not be approved until suitable remedial measures have been provided. Such measures may include, as appropriate to the circumstances, participation in provision of necessary enlargements or improvements in off-site drainageways, establishment of water retention and recharge areas and mechanical and vegetative means to control runoff and erosion from the subdivision. 
(Code 1972, § 23-21; Ord. No. 89.36, § 1) 
Sec. 90-174. - Blocks. 
(a)	General design criteria. Lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
(1)	Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated (residential, commercial, industrial or other). 
(2)	Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions. 
(3)	Need for convenient access, circulation, traffic control and safety. 
(4)	Limitations and opportunities of topography and drainage features. 
(b)	Length. Block lengths shall not exceed 1,200 feet or be less than 400 feet, except upon a finding by the SRB, in a particular case, that there is adequate justification for greater or lesser lengths. 
(c)	Pedestrian crosswalks. Where orientation or length of blocks or other considerations justify such action, the SRB may require crosswalks to improve pedestrian circulation and provide access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation and other facilities. Where such crosswalks are provided, they shall be located, dimensioned, fenced, screened, lighted or otherwise improved in such a manner as to provide security, tranquility and privacy for occupants of adjoining property and safety for users of the walks. Such pedestrian ways, if suitably improved, may be used by emergency vehicles, but shall not be used by other motor vehicles. 
(Code 1972, § 23-22; Ord. No. 89.36, § 1) 
Sec. 90-175. - Lots. 
(a)	General design criteria. Lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation shall be appropriate for location within the subdivision and location of the subdivision, and for the type of development and use contemplated. Depth of residential lots shall not normally exceed 2.5 times width, except in the case of attached dwellings or in cases where portions in excess of that depth are for the purpose of providing separation from major streets or railroads, nonaccess reservations, easements, or marshes or water areas or protective strips pertaining thereto. The depth-width ratio shall not apply in cases where the width of a lot exceeds 300 feet for its entire depth, and it may be increased by the SRB in individual cases where it finds good cause. 
(b)	Minimum dimensions. Minimum lot dimensions shall be as specified in the zoning ordinance for uses on which such limitations are indicated, subject to increases as required by the appropriate county health department for residential lots not served by public water supply and public sanitary sewerage. Depth and width of lots subdivided for nonresidential purposes shall be adequate for off-street parking and service facilities required by the type of use and development anticipated. Where such lots are to be used for purposes requiring water for domestic use and sanitary sewage disposal, and where public water and/or sanitary sewerage is not provided, they shall also conform to the minimum area requirements set by the appropriate county health department. 
(c)	Access to streets. Each lot created in a subdivision shall have direct access of at least 20 feet in width to a street which is either an existing public street or one which, upon completion of installation, can be accepted by the state or one of its political subdivisions for continual maintenance. However, limited access highways, which provide no direct access to abutting properties, shall not be considered streets for the purposes of this section. 
(d)	Double frontage and reversed frontage lots. In general, double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided, except where essential to provide residential separation from traffic arteries, to overcome other disadvantages of orientation or topography or to provide protection for adjacent uses. A planting screen easement of at least ten feet shall be provided along the line of lots abutting traffic arteries or other disadvantageous uses, across which there shall be no right of access, unless specifically authorized by the SRB. The screening shall be installed by the subdivider and maintained by his successors in title. 
(e)	Side lot lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially perpendicular or radial to street lines, unless a satisfactory lot pattern, easement pattern and area for access can otherwise be provided. 
(f)	Lot lines and utility easements. Lot lines shall be so arranged with respect to utility easements as to permit efficient installation of utilities without unnecessary irregularities in alignment. 
(g)	Determinations concerning lots for building; identification of lots not for building. No subdivision shall be approved by the SRB unless it determines that each lot or parcel intended for building contains a building site: 
(1)	Within the inner lines of required yards. 
(2)	Determined by the SRB, after review or written certification by a registered, professional engineer acting as agent for the owner, to be free from inundation and safely accessible from an approved street during rainfall of ten-year return frequency. 
(3)	With area equal to at least the following: 
a.	In agricultural districts, 5,000 square feet. 
b.	In other districts, 50 percent of the maximum buildable area permitted by the zoning ordinance in the district, but not less than 1,200 square feet. 
(4)	Of configuration reasonably adapted to building. 
(5)	Suitable for potential building use as permitted by the zoning ordinance, controlled under the provisions of ordinances and regulations adopted in conformance with the National Flood Insurance Program and without danger from subsidence, heaving, erosion or slippage of soils, from hazards or nuisances incidental to airports, as related to potential uses of such lots, or from other menaces to health, safety or the general welfare. 
As guides for such determinations, the SRB shall give due consideration to limitations, standards and requirements established in ordinances and regulations adopted in conformance with the National Flood Insurance Program, provision of water and sewerage, proposed drainage and potential types of occupancy and the like. Where a lot or parcel is not intended for building, such requirements shall not apply, but such lot or parcel shall be identified on the plat and the limitation noted thus: "Not for building site. No building permit shall be issued, nor shall any building be erected on this lot." 
(Code 1972, § 23-23; Ord. No. 89.36, § 1) 
Sec. 90-176. - Open space and urban services districts. 
(a)	Community services areas established. For the purposes of this chapter, community services areas are established as delineated on the community services areas map, which is adopted as part of this chapter and may be amended in the same manner as any other portion hereof. 
(b)	Network of public sites and open spaces; statement of intent. To provide for efficiency, economy and amenity, it is the intent of this chapter to encourage and promote the development and maintenance of public open space systems within urban services districts. In other sections of the country, it is recognized that the existence of assured permanent open space reduces need for formal planning for the open space system described herein, but the same principles, embodied in the balance of this subsection, shall apply where density of development makes such treatment appropriate. It is intended that, to the maximum extent reasonably feasible, there shall be a continuous network of public lands adapted to multiple purposes, as follows: Preservation and maintenance of natural waterways and water areas, protection of watersheds and water supply, schools, parks, playgrounds, playfields, neighborhood or community service centers, greenways, nature parks, fitness trails, bikeways, historically and culturally significant areas and sites of archaeological importance and other public uses requiring extensive open space. It is further intended that this chapter shall encourage and promote consolidation, combination and coordination of quasi-public and private common open space with the public land net, where appropriate. The purposes of such action shall include the following, applying generally or under particular sets of circumstances: 
(1)	To increase the extent, effectiveness and amenity of the total open space network. 
(2)	To provide protection for areas of substantial ecological importance. 
(3)	To minimize conflicts between automotive traffic and pedestrians and cyclists, and to provide for safe and convenient systems for movement of pedestrians and cyclists through open spaces not generally open to automotive traffic in a pattern connecting their principal origins with destinations such as schools, parks and recreational facilities; and otherwise to insure the advantages arising from an open space net with multiple potentials for public use and reuse, as contrasted with scattered open spaces serving only limited functions. 
(c)	Dedication or reservation of public sites and open spaces in urban services districts; in-lieu payments. Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, for each dwelling unit for which potential is hereafter created by subdivision within an urban services district: 
(1)	Where lands within the subdivision are of a scale, character and location generally or specifically indicated in officially adopted plans, 1,000 square feet of such land shall be reserved for acceptance of dedication within seven years from the date of recording. 
(2)	Where lands suitable in scale, character or location are not available within the subdivision, an amount equal to the assessed valuation for tax purposes of 750 square feet of buildable, unimproved land shall be paid in lieu of dedication. If the value cannot be agreed upon by the subdivider and the city, an appraisal board, consisting of one appraiser selected by the city at its own expense, one appraiser selected by the subdivider at his expense and a third appraiser selected by the other two at city expense, shall determine the value. 
(3)	In cases where the amount of land required to be dedicated or reserved for acceptance of dedication, under the formula set forth above, is less than the amount required for performance of the function involved, under standards established in officially adopted plans, the city may pay for the difference from accumulated in-lieu funds or from other sources, with value of land so acquired based on fair market value, as determined in subsection (2) above. In cases where the amount of land required to be dedicated or reserved for dedication under the formula is greater than is available in appropriate scale, character and location within the subdivision, the subdivision shall pay in lieu fees. 
Payments made by subdividers shall be due within 90 days of recording of the plat. Payments made to the city shall be made prior to recording.

(3)	The certified check should be deposited with the city manager, as escrow agent, who shall deposit it in an escrow account of the city. 
(4)	The no contest, irrevocable bank letter of credit shall be from a banking corporation licensed to do business in the state and having an office in the county.

Such notice shall indicate that, unless action required under the terms of the performance guarantee is completed within 30 days of the date of such notification, the performance guarantee or portions thereof, set forth in its terms, shall be called. Unless such action is completed, as evidenced by inspections and reports from governmental bodies exercising control transmitted through the director of planning, the city manager shall call the performance guarantee or affected portions thereof. 
(3)	Reports indicating unsatisfactory progress. Where such reports indicate that work initiated appears likely not to be completed on schedule, and where the performance guarantee provides for extension of time for cause, the director of planning shall notify the applicant by first class mail and any surety company involved concerning potential need for an application for such extension. Where such notice has been given, no application for extension shall be considered after expiration of the original schedule date. 
(g)	Actions following failure to complete work under performance guarantee. Where work required under the terms of any performance guarantee is not completed by the applicant as specified therein, the city manager, following the call of the guarantee, shall take such action as is appropriate in the circumstances of the case to procure the completion of the required improvements at the earliest reasonable time, according to the plans and specifications and staging of construction approved in connection therewith.

DIVISION 5. - COMPLIANCE MONITORING 

Sec. 98-331. - Monitoring facilities. 
(a)	The city requires the user to provide and operate at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(b)	There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
(c)	Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the city. 
(Code 1972, § 25-54; Ord. No. 93.19, § 2(6.1), 5-4-1993; Ord. No. 94.13, 3-1-1994; Ord. No. 2008.12, 4-15-2008) 
Sec. 98-332. - Inspection and sampling. 
    The city will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city, approval authority and EPA or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, or in the performance of any of their duties. The city, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the POTW, approval authority's, or EPA's access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article and cause for immediate termination of sewer and/or water service to the premises. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access. 
(Code 1972, § 25-54.1; Ord. No. 93.19, § 2(6.2), 5-4-1993; Ord. No. 94.13, 3-1-1994; Ord. No. 2008.12, 4-15-2008) 
Sec. 98-333. - Search warrants. 
    If the POTW director, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the POTW director, approval authority, or EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from the courts of the judicial district having jurisdiction over the property location.

Sec. 98-334. - Confidential information. 
(a)	Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the POTW director that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. 
(b)	When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, nondischarge permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.

DIVISION 6. - ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 98-351. - Administrative remedies. 
(a)	Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW director finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating this article, a wastewater permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained therein or any other pretreatment requirement the POTW director may serve upon such a person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days from the date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city by the user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(b)	Consent orders. The POTW director is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection (d) below. 
(c)	Show cause hearing. The POTW director may order any industrial user who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this article, or is in noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the POTW director determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. The POTW director shall review the evidence presented at the hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate. A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to the assessment of a civil penalty under section 98-352, nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW director under this section subject to an administrative appeal under section 98-282(8). 
(d)	Administrative orders. When the POTW director finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article, permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the POTW director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to do any of the following: 
(1)	Immediately comply with all requirements; 
(2)	Comply-in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in the order; 
(3)	Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a continuing or threatened violation; 
(4)	Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified time period. 
(e)	Emergency suspensions. The POTW director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any condition of its NPDES or nondischarge permit. Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user's waste discharge permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the POTW director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The POTW director shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the POTW director prior to the date of the above-described hearing. 
(f)	Termination of permit or permission to discharge. The POTW director may revoke a wastewater permit or permission to discharge for good cause including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
(1)	Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge; 
(2)	Failure to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
(3)	Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or 
(4)	Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to discharge, conditions of article VI, or any applicable state and federal regulations. 
Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under this section why the proposed action should not be taken.

The POTW director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(c)	Exceptions; approval. 
(1)	Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.	The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.	There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.	The user submitted notices as required under subsection (b) of this section. 
(2)	The POTW director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (c)(1) of this section.

Sec. 98-401. - General policy. 
(a)	It shall be the policy of the city to extend, or to allow others to extend, its water and sewer system according to the terms and conditions of this article. The cost of such extensions, whether to serve property inside or outside the corporate limits, shall be borne by the benefiting property owners under the terms provided herein. G.S. ch. 160A, art. X (G.S. 160A-216 et seq.), permits the city to levy assessments against properties benefiting by the extension of water and sewer lines and further provides that such assessments may be paid over an extended period of time. The city has no authority to levy such assessments on benefited properties outside the corporate limits, and therefore, all such costs must be borne by the party proposing such extension. 
(b)	The extension of all water and sewer lines must be made across the entire width or length of all properties to be served, in order to provide access to the next adjoining parcel of land. 
(Code 1972, § 25-55; Ord. No. 88.11, § 1; Ord. No. 89.24, § 1) 
Sec. 98-402. - Extensions to serve properties inside corporate limits. 
(a)	Construction by city. Extensions of the city's water and/or sewer system to serve properties within the city limits may be made by the city at the direction of the council or upon receipt of a valid petition requesting such extensions, subject to the availability of funds. Such a petition must be signed by at least a majority in number of the owners of property to be served and assessed, who must represent at least a majority of all the lineal feet of frontage of the properties to be served. Such petitions shall conform to all applicable city policies at their time of receipt. 
(b)	Assessments. 
(1)	Without petition. Utility main extensions inside the corporate limits and constructed by the city, or by the city's contractor, will be financed through the assessment of property owners who are benefited from the improvements. The exceptions to these assessments are those improvements which are funded totally by community development block grants. Assessments shall be based on a schedule of costs adopted annually by the council. Assessments may be reduced by the appropriate percentage when grants which do not require repayment are part of the financing for a particular line. 
(2)	With petition. It shall be the policy of the city to assess 66 2/3 percent of the full cost of improvements as outlined above to all benefited property owners, exclusive of the costs of improving intersections, based upon frontage abutting on the project, at an equal rate per foot of frontage. 
(c)	Corner and dual frontage lots. For corner and dual frontage lots, the property owner will receive a 150-foot exemption, as follows: 
(1)	If water and/or sewer lines are installed simultaneously in both streets on which a lot abuts, assessment of the cost of the installation shall be based upon the entire frontage of one street (short side), plus the frontage of the other street in excess of 150 feet. 
(2)	If a lot is already served by water and/or sewer which meets all city standards on one abutting street, any installation of the same service(s) on another abutting street shall be assessed against the lot owner to the extent that the frontage on the street in which the utilities are being installed exceeds 150 feet. 
(3)	If a lot fronts on an existing street in which the city standard water and/or sewer lines are existing and abuts at the rear on another street in which the same utility(s) is/are to be installed, no assessment shall be made if it shall appear that no reasonable subdivision of the lot can be made by which the new arrangement of the lots will benefit from the new utilities. 
The 150-foot exemption for the corner lot will not apply when the abutting property is served by facilities less than the standard size lines. In this case, the installation on the abutting street will be assessed against the property. 
(d)	Exemption for duplicating service. Along with the corner lot exemption, there is a 150-foot exemption for duplicating service when standard size or larger mains are existing in the street right-of-way and an additional main is installed. In order for these exemptions on corner lots and duplicating services to apply, the existing lines must have been assessed against the property; were installed by a developer without charge to the city; were paid for with community development funds; or were installed prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
(e)	Connection to lines outside corporate limits. When water and/or sewer lines are located outside the corporate limits and were paid for by the city, a fee equal to the assessment cost of lines then in effect will be collected from the property owner desiring to connect to these services at the time a connection is requested. 
(f)	Connection fees. In addition to the assessment charges, all other fees for water and/or sewer connections still apply. 
(g)	Request for extension. Requests for extensions must be made on a prescribed form and submitted to the city manager. The city manager will present the petition to the council for consideration according to procedures outlined in G.S. 160A-223-160A-237. 
(h)	Extensions constructed by persons other than city.

ARTICLE VIII. - CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL 

Sec. 98-501. - Introduction. 
(a)	The purpose of this cross connection control article is to define the authority of the city as the water purveyor in the elimination of all cross connections within its public potable water supply. 
(b)	This article shall apply to all users connected to the city public potable water supply regardless of whether the user is located within the city or outside of the city. 
(c)	This article will comply with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act (PL 93-523), the North Carolina State Administrative Code (15A NCAC 08C), and the North Carolina State Building Code (Volume II) as they pertain to cross connections with the public water supply. 
(Ord. No. 2008-26, 9-2-2008) 
Sec. 98-502. - Objectives of article. 
    The specific objectives of this cross connection control article for the city are as follows: 
(1)	To protect the public potable water supply of the county against actual or potential contamination by isolating within the consumer's water system contaminants or pollutants which could, under adverse conditions, backflow through uncontrolled cross connections into the public water system. 
(2)	To eliminate or control existing cross connections, actual or potential, between the consumer's potable water system and nonpotable or industrial piping system. 
(3)	To provide a continuing inspection program of cross connection control which will systematically and effectively control all actual or potential cross connections which may be installed in the future. 
(Ord. No. 2008-26, 9-2-2008) 
Sec. 98-503. - Responsibilities. 
(a)	Health agency. The state department of environment and natural resources has the responsibility for promulgating and enforcing laws, rules, regulations, and policies to be followed in carrying out an effective cross connection control program. The state department of environment and natural resources also has the primary responsibility of insuring that the water purveyor operates the public potable water system free of actual or potential sanitary hazards, including unprotected cross connections. The state department of environment and natural resources has the further responsibility of insuring that the water purveyor provides an approved water supply at the service connection to the consumer's water system and, further, that it requires the installation, testing, and maintenance of any approved backflow prevention assembly on the service connection when required. 
(b)	Water purveyor. Except as otherwise provided in this article, the water purveyor's (City of Newton's) responsibility to ensure a safe water supply begins at the source and includes all of the public water distribution system, including the service connection, and ends as the point of delivery to the consumer's water system. In addition, the water purveyor shall exercise reasonable vigilance to insure that the consumer has taken the proper steps to protect the public potable water system. To insure that the proper precautions are taken, the city is required to determine the degree of hazard or potential hazard to the public potable water system; to determine the degree of protection required; and to ensure proper containment protection through an on-going inspection program. When it is determined that a backflow prevention assembly is required for the protection of the public system the city shall require the consumer, at the consumer's expense, to install an approved backflow prevention assembly at each service connection, to test immediately upon installation and thereafter at a frequency as determined by the city, to properly repair and maintain such assembly or assemblies and to keep adequate records of each test and subsequent maintenance and repair, including materials and/or replacement parts. 
(c)	Plumbing inspection. The plumbing inspection departments of the city and the county have the responsibility to not only review building plans and inspect plumbing as it is installed; but they have the explicit responsibility of preventing cross connections from being designed and built into the plumbing system within its jurisdiction. Where the review of building plans suggests or detects the potential for cross connections being made an integral part of the plumbing system, the plumbing inspector has the responsibility, under the state building code, for requiring that such cross connections be either eliminated or provided with backflow prevention equipment approved by the state building code. The plumbing inspector's responsibility begins at the point of delivery, downstream of the first installed backflow prevention assembly, and continues throughout the entire length of the consumer's water system. The plan inspector should inquire about the intended use of water at any point where it is suspected that a cross connection might be made or where one is actually called for by the plans. When such is discovered it shall be mandatory that a suitable, approved backflow prevention assembly approved by the state building code be required by the plans and be properly installed. The primary protection assembly for containment purposes only shall have approval from the city, the state building code, and the state department of environment and natural resources. 
(d)	Consumer. The consumer has the primary responsibility of preventing pollutants and contaminants from entering his potable water system or the public potable water system. The consumer's responsibility starts at the point of delivery from the public potable water system and includes all of his water system. The consumer, at his own expense, shall install, operate, test, and maintain approved backflow prevention assemblies as directed by the city. The consumer shall maintain accurate records of tests and repairs made to backflow prevention assemblies and shall maintain such records for a minimum period of three years. The records shall be on forms approved by the city and shall include the list of materials or replacement parts used. Following any repair, overhaul, repiping or relocation of an assembly, the consumer shall have it tested to insure that it is in good operating condition and will prevent backflow. Tests, maintenance and repairs of backflow assemblies shall be made by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester. 
(e)	Certified backflow prevention assembly testers. When employed by the consumer to test, repair, overhaul, or maintain backflow prevention assemblies, a backflow prevention assembly tester will have the following responsibilities: The tester will be responsible for making competent inspections and for repairing or overhauling backflow prevention assemblies and making reports of such repair to the consumer and responsible authorities on forms approved by the city. The tester shall include the list of materials or replacement parts used. The tester shall be equipped with and be competent to use all the necessary tools, gauges, manometers and other equipment necessary to properly test, repair, and maintain backflow prevention assemblies. It will be the tester's responsibility to insure that original manufactured parts are used in the repair of or replacement of parts in a backflow prevention assembly. It will be the tester's further responsibility not to change the design, material or operational characteristics of an assembly during repair or maintenance without prior approval of the city: A North Carolina certified tester shall perform the work and be responsible for the competency and accuracy of all tests and reports. A certified tester shall provide a copy of all test and repair reports to the consumer and to the city cross connection control department within ten business days of any completed test or repair work. A certified tester shall maintain such records for a minimum period of three years. All certified backflow assembly test equipment which has been evaluated and/or approved by the city. All test equipment shall be checked for accuracy annually, at a minimum, calibrated, if necessary.

This assembly shall only be used to protect against a nonhealth hazard (i.e., pollutant). 
    Hazard-Degree of. The term "degree of hazard" is derived from the evaluation of conditions within a system which can be classified as either a "pollutional" (nonhealth) or a "contamination" (health) hazard. 
    Hazard-Health. The term "health hazard" means an actual or potential threat of contamination of a physical, hazardous or toxic nature to the public or consumer's potable water system to such a degree or intensity that there would be a danger to health. 
    Hazard-Nonhealth. The term "nonhealth hazard" means an actual or potential threat to the quality of the public or the consumer's potable water system. A nonhealth hazard is one that, if introduced into the public water supply system could be a nuisance to water customers, but would not adversely affect human health. 
    Hazard-Pollutional. The term "pollutional hazard" means an actual or potential threat to the quality or the potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system but which would not constitute a health or a system hazard, as defined.

Disclaimer: The City of Newton may make recommendations, upon facility inspection, as to the usages of isolation devices/assemblies, but does not assume or have responsibility whatsoever for such installations. 
    Point of delivery means generally at the property line of the customer, adjacent to the public street where the City of Newton's mains are located, or at a point on the customer's property where the meter is located. The customer shall be responsible for all water piping and control devices located on the customer's side of the point of delivery. 
    Pollution means an impairment of the quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect the aesthetic qualities of such waters for domestic used. 
    Potable water means water from any source which has been investigated by the state department of environment and natural resources and which has been approved for human consumption. 
    Public potable water system means any publicly or privately owned water system operated as a public utility, under a current state department of environment and natural resources permit, to supply water for public consumption or-use. This system will include all sources, facilities, and appurtenances between the source and the point of delivery such as valves, pumps, pipes, conduits, tanks, receptacles, fixtures, equipment, and appurtenances used to produce, convey, treat, or store potable water for public consumption or use. 
    Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly means an assembly containing within its structure a minimum of two independently acting, approved check valves, together with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, pressure differential relief valve located between the check valves and at the same time below the first check valve. The first check valve reduces the supply pressure a predetermined amount so that during normal flow and at cessation of normal flow, the pressure between the checks is less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the pressure differential relief valve, by discharge to atmosphere, shall operate to maintain the pressure between the checks less than the supply pressure. The unit shall include tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly and each assembly shall be fitted with properly located test cocks. The assembly is designed to protect against a health hazard (i.e., contaminant). 
    Reduced pressure principle detector assembly means a specially designed assembly composed of line-size approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly with a specific bypass water meter and a meter-sized approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. The meter shall register, in U.S. gallons, accurately for only very low rates of flow and shall show a registration for all rates of flow. This assembly shall be used to protect against a health hazard (i.e., contaminant). 
    Service connections means the terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system, i.e., where the City of Newton loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the consumer's water system. 
    Vacuum breaker-Atmospheric type. The term "atmospheric vacuum breaker," also known as the "nonpressure type vacuum breaker," means a device containing a float-check, a check seat, and an air inlet port. The flow of water into the body causes the float to close the air inlet port. When the flow of water stops, the float falls and forms a check valve against back-siphonage and at the same time opens the air inlet port to allow air to enter and satisfy the vacuum. A shutoff valve immediately upstream may be an integral part of the device. An atmospheric vacuum breaker is designed to protect against a nonhealth hazard, isolation protection only, under a back-siphonage condition only. 
    Vacuum breaker-Pressure type. The term "pressure vacuum breaker" means an assembly containing an independently operating internally loaded check valve and an independently operating loaded air inlet valve located on the discharge side of the check valve. The assembly is to be equipped with properly located test cocks and tightly closing shutoff valves attached at each end of the assembly. This assembly is designed to protect against a health hazard (i.e., contaminant) under a back-siphonage condition only. 
    Water purveyor means the owner or operator of a public potable water system, providing an approved water supply to the public. 
    Water supply-Approved. The term "approved water supply" means any public potable water supply which has been investigated and approved by the state department of environment and natural resources. The system must be operating under a valid health permit. In determining what constitutes an approved water supply, the state department of environment and natural resources has reserved the final judgment as to its safety and potability. 
    Water supply-Auxiliary. The term "auxiliary water supply" means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural source such as a well, spring, river, stream, etc., "used water", or industrial fluids. These waters may be polluted, contaminated, or objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control. 
    Water supply-Unapproved. The term "unapproved water supply" means a water supply which has not been approved for human consumption by the state department of environment and natural resources. 
    Water-Used. The term "used water" means any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the control of the water purveyor.

    Determinations necessary for administration and enforcement of performance standards set forth herein range from those which can be made with satisfactory accuracy by a reasonable person using normal senses and no sophisticated equipment to those requiring great technical competence and complex equipment for precise measurement. It is the intent of this chapter that: 
(1)	Where determinations can be made by the planning director or his designee, using equipment normally available or attainable without extraordinary expense, such determinations shall be so made before notice of violation is issued. 
(2)	Where technical complexity or extraordinary expense makes it unreasonable for the city to maintain the personnel or equipment necessary for making difficult or unusual determinations, procedures shall be available for causing corrections of apparent violations of performance standards, for protecting individuals from arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable administration and enforcement of performance standard regulations, and for protecting the general public from unnecessary costs for administration and enforcement.

Failure to obey lawful orders concerning such correction shall be punishable as provided in article I of this chapter.

(a)	If, in the considered judgment of the planning director or his designee, there is a probable violation of the performance standards as set forth in this chapter, the following procedures shall be followed: 
(1)	The planning director or his designee shall give written notice, by registered mail, to the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation. The notice shall describe the particulars of the alleged violation and the reasons why the planning director or his designee believes there is a violation in fact, and shall require an answer or correction of the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the planning director or his designee within a reasonable time limit as set by the planning director or his designee. Such reasonable time limit shall not exceed 30 days. The notice shall further state that, upon request of those to whom it is directed, technical determinations as described in this chapter will be made, and that if violations as alleged are found, costs of such determinations shall be charged against those responsible for the violation, in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate; but that if it is determined that no violation exists, the cost of the determination will be paid by the city. 
(2)	If there is no reply within the time limit set, but the alleged violation is corrected to the satisfaction of the planning director or his designee, he shall note "violation corrected" on his copy of the notice, and shall retain it among his official records, taking such other action as may be warranted. 
(3)	If there is no reply within the time limit set and the alleged violation is not corrected to the satisfaction of the planning director or his designee within the time limit set, he shall proceed to take or cause to be taken such action as is warranted by continuation of a violation after notice to cease. 
(4)	If a reply is received within the time limit set indicating that the alleged violation will be corrected to the satisfaction of the planning director or his designee, but requesting additional time, the planning director or his designee may grant an extension, if he deems it warranted in the circumstances of the case and if the extension will not, in his opinion, cause imminent peril of life, health, or property. 
(b)	If reply is received within the time limit set requesting technical determination as provided in this chapter, and if the alleged violations continue, the planning director or his designee shall call in properly qualified experts to make the determinations. If expert findings indicate violation of the performance standards, the cost of the determinations shall be assessed against the properties or persons responsible for the violation, in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate. 
(c)	If no violation is found, the costs of the determinations shall be paid by the city without assessment against the properties or persons involved.

    Where uncertainty exists as to boundaries of districts, or other areas delineated for regulatory purposes in the official zoning atlas, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)	Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, alleys, rights-of-way, or easements; variation between actual and mapped location; effect of vacation on zoning status of property. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, alleys, rights-of-way or easements shall be construed as following such centerlines as they exist on the ground (except where variation of actual location from mapped location would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel, in which case the boundary shall be so interpreted as to avoid such change). In the event of vacation of the street, the boundary shall be construed as remaining in its location except where ownership of the vacated property is divided other than at the center, in which case the boundary shall be construed as moving with the ownership. 
(2)	Boundaries indicated as approximately following boundaries of streets, alleys, other public or private property lines, rights-of-way, or easements. Boundaries indicated as approximately following boundaries of streets, alleys, other public or private property lines, rights-of-way, or easements, shall be construed as following such boundaries, except where variation of actual location from mapped location would change the district status of a lot or parcel, in which case the boundary shall be so interpreted as to avoid such change. 
(3)	Boundaries indicated as approximately following mean high water lines or centerlines of rivers, canals, lakes, bays or other bodies of water. Boundaries indicated as approximately following mean high water lines or centerlines of rivers, canals, lakes, bays, or other bodies of water shall be construed as following such mean high water line, or centerlines. If said mean high water line or centerline changes, the boundary shall be construed as moving with the change, except where such moving would change the district status of a lot or parcel, in which case the boundary be interpreted in such manner as to avoid such change. 
(4)	Boundaries indicated as approximately parallel to or extensions of features. Boundaries indicated as approximately parallel to or extensions of features described in subsections (1), (2), and (3) above shall be construed as being parallel to or extensions of such features. 
(5)	Nonspecifically indicated distances determined by reference. Where distances are not specifically indicated on any map in the official zoning atlas, they shall be determined by reference to the scale of the map. 
(6)	Boundaries indicated as entering any body of water. Boundaries indicated as entering any body of water, but not continuing to intersect with other zoning boundaries or with the limits of the jurisdiction of the city, shall be construed as extending, in the direction in which they enter the body of water, to intersect with other zoning boundaries or with the limits of city jurisdiction. 
(7)	Excluded areas. Where parcels of land and water areas have been inadvertently excluded from a zoning district classification in any manner, said parcels shall be classified in conformance with that district which surrounds it or which is most restrictive adjacent to it, until changed after a public hearing. 
(8)	Action in cases of remaining uncertainty, conflicts. In other circumstances not covered above, or where existing natural or manmade features are at variance with those shown in the official zoning atlas, or where it is illegible or unclear, or where interpretation based on the above rules appears to produce contradiction or conflict with the intent of this Code, or upon request from the planning director or from any affected property owner, the board of adjustment shall make a finding and interpretation concerning the boundaries involved in accord with the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
In cases where such finding and interpretation involves only correction to the official zoning atlas or any official supplement and does not change the zoning of any lot, the board may direct corrections without proposing an amendment to the map involved. In cases where the zoning of any lot would be changed by such correction, the board shall initiate a proposed corrective amendment.

Land designated P-1 shall normally be served with public water and sewer services and be located with access to arterial or collector thoroughfares with access through local residential streets discouraged. 
(8)	B-1 neighborhood shopping districts. The B-1 district is intended to provide for the sale of convenience goods and a limited number of personal services to the residents of the surrounding neighborhood.

ARTICLE V. - APPLICATION OF AREA, HEIGHT AND PLACEMENT REGULATIONS 

Sec. 102-231. - Regulations encumbering land required to satisfy chapter requirements. 
    No portion of a lot, used in connection with an existing or proposed building, structure or use, and necessary for compliance with the area, height and placement regulations of this chapter shall, through sale or otherwise, be used again as part of the lot required in connection with any other building, structure, or use. 
(Code 1972, § 26-6.1; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991) 
Sec. 102-232. - Height regulations generally. 
(a)	Excluded portions of structures. Except as specifically provided herein, the height limitations of this chapter shall not apply to any roof structures for housing elevators, stairways, tanks, ventilating fans, solar energy collectors, or similar equipment required to operate and maintain a building, provided that such structures shall not cover more than 33 percent of roof area or extend over ten feet in height; nor to church spires, steeples, belfries, cupolas, domes, monuments, water towers, skylights, flag poles, vents, construction or mining cranes or draglines, or similar structures, which may be erected above the height limit; nor to fire or parapet walls, provided, however, that such walls shall not extend more than five feet above the roof. 
(b)	Aviation hazards. No building or other structure, regardless of exclusions set forth in subsection (a) above, shall be located in a manner or built to a height which constitutes a hazard to aviation or creates hazards or property by reason of unusual exposure to aviation hazards. 
(Code 1972, § 26-6.2; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991) 
Sec. 102-233. - Unusually tall structures. 
    Unless specifically stated otherwise elsewhere in this chapter concerning height, towers that are principal structures in themselves, such as high voltage transmission line towers, telephone or electronic relay or transmission and receiving towers, grain elevators, silos and other such agricultural uses and similar principal structures, may only exceed the height limitations established for the district wherein they are proposed for location following review as Class B special use permit by the board of adjustment. The board of adjustment may only grant the special use permit where it finds: 
(1)	That the proposed structure would not result in restriction or interference with air traffic or air travel to or from any existing or proposed airport. 
(2)	That the proposed structure is consistent with the existing surrounding uses, and is compatible with the existing neighborhood development. 
(3)	That the proposed structure is consistent with any adopted or projected development plan for the area. 
(4)	That the proposed structure is not detrimental to the existing or proposed use of any neighboring property, and does not unreasonably restrict the free flow of light, sunlight and air to those properties. 
(Code 1972, § 26-6.3; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991) 
Sec. 102-234. - Accessory structures. 
    Accessory structures in a residential zoning district shall conform to the following regulations: 
(1)	Detached garages and carports may be constructed or placed in either side yard or the front yard of a principal residential structure, provided they comply with the minimum front and side building setback requirements for the district in which they are to be located. 
(2)	Accessory structures, in addition to detached garages and carports, shall be located in the rear yard, provided they do not occupy cumulatively more than 30 percent of the rear yard and that they be no closer to the rear or side property lines than five feet with the exception of fences which do not exceed eight feet in height. 
(3)	Neither a manufactured home nor a recreational vehicle, as defined by this chapter, shall be permitted as a residential accessory structure. 
(4)	Fences which do not exceed four feet in height may be constructed in the front yard. Fences which do not exceed eight feet in height may be constructed in either side yard or in the rear yard. 
(5)	Swimming pools (in ground) and swimming pools (above ground, regulated) as defined by section 26-2.2 are allowed in rear and side yards. Provided they are able to meet a five feet setback off all property lines. In cases where a deck or other structure(s) are associated with the pool the same setbacks apply, unless specifically otherwise stated within other provisions of this chapter. Swimming pools (in ground) and swimming pools (above ground, regulated) are not generally permitted in front yards. In cases where the front yard setback is measured from the shortest frontage on a corner lot, and the principal structure faces the frontage on another street, swimming pools may be placed in front yards, subject to all other provisions being met. 
(Code 1972, § 26-6.4; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991; Ord. No. 92.41, § 1, 8-4-1992; Ord. No. 2006.23, § 3, 10-17-2006) 
Sec. 102-235. - Permitted projections into required setbacks. 
(a)	Certain architectural features, such as, but not limited to, awnings, cornices, eaves, stoops and gutters, may project no more than three feet into the required front setback, five feet into the required rear setback and two feet into the required side setback. 
(b)	Mechanical equipment, such as air conditioning units, heat pumps, heating equipment, solar panels, and similar installations, may not project into the required front setback, but may project five feet into the required rear setback and two feet into the required side setback. 
(Code 1972, § 26-6.6; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991) 
Sec. 102-236. - Averaging an existing residential front setback line. 
    In a residential district, where the average of the front setbacks for all adjacent lots, which are located within 200 feet of either side of a lot is greater than the required front setback specified in this chapter, a required setback line shall be provided on the lot equal to this greater average depth but not to exceed 40 feet. Where such average of the front setback is less than the minimum required from setback, the required setback line may be reduced to this lesser average depth, but in no case to less than ten feet. For the purpose of computing such average, an adjacent vacant lot shall be considered as having the minimum required front setback specified for the zoning district. 
(Code 1972, § 26-6.7; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991) 
Sec. 102-237. - Visibility at intersections. 
    On corner lots within the triangular area formed by joining points with a straight line on the street right-of-way lines of intersecting or intercepting streets 25 feet from their intersection, there shall be no obstruction to vision by structures, parking of vehicles, grade or foliage, other than power or utility poles, between the height of three feet and the height of ten feet, measured above the average elevation of the existing surface of each street at the centerlines thereof. This section shall not apply to structures located within the B-3 central business district. Diagram 5-1 illustrates the methodology for measuring triangular area to preserve visibility at intersections.

(Code 1972, § 26-6.8; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991) 
Sec. 102-238. - Calculation of combined requirements or limitations. 
    Where cumulative requirements or limitations are to be computed for a series of elements (as, for example, the number of off-street parking or loading spaces required for a combination of uses in the same building), fractions shall be carried forward in the summation, and the total rounded to the next largest whole number. 
(Code 1972, § 26-6.9; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991) 
Sec. 102-239. - Lot dimensions and area; yards. 
(a)	Measurement of lot width. The width of a lot shall be measured across the rear of the required front setback line, provided, however, that such width shall be not less than 25 feet and that such width between side lot lines where they intersect with the street line shall not be less than 80 percent of the required minimum lot width except in the case of lots on the turning circles of cul-de-sacs or at similar points of street curvature where the radius of the right-of-way line (or a circle approximately following the right-of-way line and intersecting the foremost points of the side lot lines) is less than 90 feet, in which case the 80 percent requirement shall not apply. Diagram 5-2 indicates the relationships involved. 
DIAGRAM 5-2 

Lot "taper" permissible at 90' curve radius (A) or along straight street (B), with required front yard depth 25' required lot width 70'. (Street of lot width as measured at rear of required front yard). Lots with lines radial to a curved street line with curve radius less than 90' (in this case 70') need not comply with 80% rule. Lot C shows application with 20% front yard, D with 25' applies in turn-circles of cul-de-sacs, or at sharp bends in streets.  
(b)	Lot area. The area of a lot shall be construed as total area within its boundaries. 
(c)	Lot types. Diagram 5-3 illustrates terminology used herein with reference to corner interior, reversed frontage, and through lots. 
DIAGRAM 5-3 

    In Diagram 5-3, Lot A is a corner lot, defined as a lot located at the intersection of two or more streets. A lot abutting a curved street or streets shall be considered a corner lot if straight lines drawn from the foremost points of the side lot lines to the foremost point of the lot (projected if rounded) meet at an interior angle of less than 135 degrees. 
    Lot B is an interior lot, defined as a lot other than a corner lot and abutting one street. Alleys shall not be considered as streets for purposes of this definition. 
    Lot C is a through lot, defined as a lot other than a corner lot, and with frontage on more than one street. Through lots abutting two streets shall be referred to as double-frontage lots unless a corner lot. Alleys shall not be considered as streets for purposes of this definition. 
    Lot D is a reversed frontage lot, defined as a lot on which the frontage is at right angles or approximately right angles (interior angles less than 135 degrees) to the general pattern in the area. A reversed frontage lot may also be a corner lot (A-D in the diagram), an interior lot (B-D) or a through lot (C-D). 
(d)	Lot frontage. 
(1)	Interior lots. On interior lots, the front of a lot shall be construed as the portion nearest the street. 
(2)	Corner lots. On corner lots, the frontage shall be construed as the shortest boundary to a street. When a lot has equal frontage on two or more streets, the planning director shall determine lot frontage in accordance with the prevailing building pattern or the prevailing lotting pattern. If a building pattern has not been established, then the owner shall have the option of determining lot frontage. 
(3)	Through lots. On through lots, all portions adjacent to streets shall be considered as frontage for regulatory purposes. If the planning director finds that the pattern of lots or the pattern of required yards, on lots adjacent to portions of the through lot, is such as to justify the elimination of the requirement that more than one frontage be provided on the lot, such additional frontage shall not be required. 
(e)	Measurement of yards; special yard requirements. The following rules shall apply with regard to determinations on yards on lots: 
(1)	Yards adjacent to streets. Required yards adjacent to streets shall be measured as a line parallel to the street right-of-way line. 
(2)	Interior side yards. Interior side yards shall be construed as running from the rear line of the required front yard to the front line of the required rear yard, if required, or, if no rear yard is required, to the opposite lot line. The width of a required side yard shall be measured perpendicular to the side lot line and the inner line of the required yard shall be parallel to such outer line, at the minimum distance therefrom prescribed in district regulations. 
(3)	Interior side yards on through lots with more than one front yard. Interior side yards on through lots with more than one front yard shall be construed as running to the rear lines of the front yards involved, and measurements and requirements shall be as for subsection (e)(1), above. 
(4)	Interior side yards on corner lots. On corner lots in all residential, office and institutional neighborhood shopping, and highway business districts, the side yard abutting a street shall not be less than 20 feet wide. 
(f)	Rear yards. 
(1)	Generally. Rear yards shall be construed as extending across the full width of the lot at its rear, except as stated in subsection (e)(4) above. Required depth of rear yards shall be determined in the same manner as required width of interior side yards. 
(2)	No rear yard required on corner lots or lots providing two front yards. If the corner lot has more than four sides, the yards along the interior lot lines which do not intersect a street line shall be considered rear yard and meet the district requirement therefor. 
(g)	Yards diagram. Diagram 5-4 below indicates nomenclature, location, and yards. 
DIAGRAM 5-4 

(h)	Minimum lot area. Minimum lot area is the minimum square footage required by a lot by this chapter. The minimum area shall not include submerged lands. Roadways or rights-of-way provided by the owner or developer of the lot may be included with the zoning lot for the purposes of calculating density or compliance with the minimum lot area for individual lots. Square footage and minimum lot area requirements shall be measured and calculated from established right-of-way lines, or in situations of existing streets where no right-of-way has been legally established, from right-of-way lines, or in situations of existing streets where no right-of-way claimed for maintenance by the city or the state department of transportation. 
(Code 1972, § 26-6.10; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991; Ord. No. 92.42, § 1, 8-4-1992) 
Sec. 102-240. - Buildings to be located only on lot of record; access to lots. 
(a)	Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be located on a lot of record as defined by this chapter and, with the exception of planned developments, as defined and permitted by this chapter, there shall not be more than one principal building and its customary accessory buildings on such lot of record. 
(b)	Every lot of record, except those created by a landlocked subdivision as provided for in chapter 90, shall abut upon either a publicly dedicated and maintained street, a neighborhood public road as provided for in G.S. 136-67, or a municipal neighborhood public road as defined by this chapter. No dwelling shall be erected on a lot which does not abut on at least one of the above defined streets or roads for a distance of at least 371/2 feet, except where said lot was created as a result of a landlocked subdivision as provided for in chapter 90. 
(Code 1972, § 26-6.11; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991; Ord. No. 96.9, § 2, 2-21-1996; Ord. No. 99.34, § 1, 4-21-1999) 
Sec. 102-241. - Open space and building spacing in residential districts, PD-H districts and other districts in which two-family and multiple family residential uses are permitted. 
(a)	Intent. Yards, courts, and other open space required herein in relation to structures or portions of structures containing dwelling or lodging units are intended to perform a variety of functions. Among these (as appropriate to and required by the uses involved and their locations) are assuring adequate privacy, desirable outlook, natural light and ventilation; access to and around services areas; space for landscaping; spacing between buildings and portions of buildings for reducing potential adverse effects of noise, odor, glare, or hazards from fire; and recreation space near buildings. 
(b)	Calculation of building spacing requirements. Spacing requirements for buildings or portions of buildings containing dwelling or lodging units shall be based on horizontal length of walls, number of stories, type of windows in walls involved, and orientation of main exterior entrance to individual units Each building shall have yards surrounding it as calculated by the formulas described in subsection (g) below. The outer perimeter of these required yards shall be defined as the building site line. The distance between adjacent buildings shall be, at a minimum, the sum of the required yards for each building. The distance between a building and the lot line shall be, at a minimum, the yard required by this section. Diagram 5-5 illustrates these relationships. 
DIAGRAM 5-5 

Yard A is the left yard required by Building 1 
Yard B is the right yard required by Building 1 
Yard C is the left yard required by Building 2 
Yard D is the right yard required by Building 2 
B + C = the required spacing between Buildings 1 and 2 
(c)	Definitions and classifications relating to windows and building walls. For purposes of establishing open space requirements to adjacent to building walls enclosing dwellings or lodgings, the following definitions and classifications shall govern: 
(1)	Habitable rooms are rooms designed and used for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, or combinations thereof. Bathrooms, toilet compartments, closets, halls, storage rooms, laundry and utility spaces, basement recreation rooms, and similar areas are not considered habitable rooms. 
(2)	Primary windows are windows in habitable rooms except bedrooms and kitchens. 
(3)	Primary walls are walls containing primary windows or main exterior entrances to individual living quarters when directly facing a primary wall. 
(4)	Secondary walls are walls containing only secondary, or secondary and tertiary, windows. 
(5)	Tertiary windows are windows other than for habitable rooms. 
(d)	Length of walls. Length of walls shall be measured as the horizontal distance from corner to corner. Where walls in continuous general frontage (as in the case of attached dwellings) are offset by angles or setbacks of six feet or more, length of each segment so set off shall be measured separately in establishing pertinent yard depth. Where walls in continuous general frontage enclose portions of buildings varying one story or more in height, the length of each segment so varying shall be measured separately in computing pertinent yard depth. Length of the wall of a circular building shall be construed as the diameter of the buildings. 
(e)	Height in stories. Height in stories shall be computed as the actual number of stories in the wall above ground level, with the following exceptions. Where the wall is along a slope, the number of stories shall be construed as the arithmetic mean number, with half a story or more considered as a full story, and less than half a story ignored in computations. When height per story exceeds an average of 11 feet, calculations involved in yard or spacing determination shall be based on an assumed number of stories served by dividing building height by ten feet. Penthouses, roof shelters, and housing for mechanical equipment shall be ignored in computations, except where they are visible from the ground level within the lot or the building site, are ten feet or more in height, or occupy 50 percent or more of the length of the wall at their bases, in which case an additional story shall be included in the computation. 
(f)	Measurement of open space depth. 
(1)	Yard or other open space depth between exterior building walls and adjacent lot or building site lines shall be measured horizontally in relation to the ground, and perpendicularly to straight walls or radially to curved walls. Distance at all points shall be at least equal to minimum requirements set forth herein, except yard space for two walls may overlap where it does not affect the distance between two buildings. 
(2)	Where portions of buildings contain different numbers of stories, and different offsets, the required yard shall be as established for the portion of the portion of the proposed building nearest to the lot or adjacent building except where a portion of the proposed building requires a greater yard because of its greater number of stories or size. Lower portions of buildings may extend into yards required for upper portions, but shall provide the yards required by their size and height. 
(3)	Diagram 5-6 illustrates these relationships. On the left side of the building, the height and size of the upper portion of the building results in a yard, (A), which is greater than the yard, (B), which would be required by the lower portion. The greater yard, (A), would be the required yard for the left side of the building. On the right side of the building, the lower portion of the building extends further toward the lot line such that its yard, (D), would move the building farther from the lot line than the yard, (C), required by the taller portion of the building. The yard labeled D would be the required yard for the right side of the building.

(g)	Formulas determining minimum open space requirements adjacent to walls. Minimum distance between building walls containing dwelling units shall be computed as follows, where D is depth in feet, L is length in feet, and S is height in stories: 
(1)	Primary walls: D = 6 + 2S + L/10 
(2)	Secondary walls: D = 2 + S + L/10, but not less than ten feet if adjacent to zoning lot boundaries. 
(3)	Tertiary walls: Only as required for required yards, as required for fire protection by building or other applicable codes, or five feet, whichever is greater. If a tertiary wall occurs next to a zoning lot line, the minimum distance is ten feet. 
The yard requirements stated above are minimums. If greater yard requirements are established elsewhere in this Code, said greater requirements shall apply. Diagram 5-6 illustrates these provisions.

Sec. 102-290. - Buffers and screening. 
    In order to reduce the impact of a use of land on adjacent uses which are of a significantly different character, density or intensity, buffers and screening shall be required in accord with the following: 
(1)	Buffer required. A buffer consists of a horizontal distance from a lot line which may only be occupied by screening, underground utilities, retention areas and landscaping materials. The required buffering distance in feet between the proposed land uses and the existing adjacent land use on adjoining zoning lots is set forth in the Buffer Matrix, Table 6-1, below. If the land next to the proposed development is vacant, the buffering required shall be determined by the existing zoning on the adjacent vacant parcel. If the adjacent parcel is vacant, but is zoned for a more intensive zoning district, no buffer area shall be required of the less intensive use. The relative degree of intensity shall be determined as follows: 
a.	Single-family (as used in this section) shall be the least intensive. 
b.	Two-family and multiple family, less than 12 units per acre, shall be the next least intensive. 
c.	Multiple family, more than or equal to 12 units per acre, shall be the next least intensive. 
d.	Group 1 shall be the next least intensive. 
e.	Group 2 shall be the next least intensive.

(2)	Screening required. Screening shall be required along the property boundaries of the zoning lot with the exception that screening such as hedges, fences or walls, as described in this section, shall not be over four feet tall within the front yard(s). 
a.	Within buffers ten feet or less in required width, partial screening is required and shall consist of at least the following, together with any additional specifications of the Manual of City Specifications: 
1.	One of the following: 
i.	A row of street trees planted in accord with the Manual of City Specifications; 
ii.	A masonry wall located within the required buffer; such wall shall be a minimum height of six feet (above finished grade); and, if a block wall, it shall be painted on all sides; 
iii.	A solid wooden fence six feet in height; or 
iv.	A berm and planting combination, with the berm an average height of three feet and dense plantings which will, when combined with the berm, achieve a minimum height of six feet and 75 percent opacity within two years. 
2.	Lawn, low-growing evergreen shrubs, evergreen ground cover, or rock or wood mulch covering the balance of the buffer. 
b.	Within required buffers of between 10.1 feet and 15 feet in width, screening is required and shall consist of at least the following, together with any additional specifications of the Manual of City Specifications: 
1.	The requirements of subsection a. above; and 
2.	A row of evergreen shrubs planted not more than five feet apart to form a continuous hedge, at least six feet high within two years of installation; or a solid brick, stone or wooden fence, a minimum of six feet high; or a berm and planting combination, with the berm having an average height of three feet, and dense evergreen shrubs which, when combined with the berm, achieve a height of six feet of continuous hedge within two years of installation. 
c.	Within required buffers more than 15 feet in width, screening is required and shall consist of at least the following, together with any additional specifications of the Manual of City Specifications: 
1.	The requirements of subsection (1) above; or 
2.	A double row of evergreen trees which are not less than ten feet high at time of installation, planted no more than ten feet apart; and 
3.	Lawn, low-growing evergreen ground cover, or rock or wood mulch covering the balance of the buffer. 
(3)	Alternative buffers and screening. In lieu of compliance with the above buffer and screening requirement, an applicant may submit to the planning director for his review and approval a detailed plan and specifications for landscaping and screening. The planning director may approve the alternative buffering and screening, in writing, upon finding that the proposal will afford a degree of buffering and screening, in terms of height, opacity and separation, equivalent to or exceeding that provided by the above requirements. 
(4)	Existing vegetation. The retention of existing vegetation shall be maximized to the extent practicable, wherever such vegetation contributes to required buffering and screening or to the preservation of significant trees. Exotic, nuisance trees, as listed in the Manual of City Specifications, are not considered significant trees and their removal is encouraged. Where tree replacement is necessary or desired, the selection of significant trees to replace those removed is recommended. 
(5)	Maintenance and irrigation of landscaping. All landscaping and screening which provides required buffering and screening shall be maintained so as to continue their effectiveness. 
(6)	Determination of unlisted uses. The planning director shall make a determination, in the cases of uses not listed in Table 6-1, of the group appropriate for such uses. In reading the determination, the planning director shall be guided by the requirements for similar uses having comparable external effects. 
(7)	Buffers adjacent to streams. The retention of natural vegetation shall be maximized to the extent practicable within a required buffer whenever it is adjacent to or contains a stream or drainage feature. 
(8)	Topography. In situations where the topography would render most practical required screening noneffective, the planning director may allow the screening to be located outside of the required buffer and placed in a location that will enable the screening to be effective in meeting the intent of this section.

ARTICLE VIII. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 102-381. - Classification. 
    Nonconformities are classified as lots; uses of land without structures or with minor structures only; uses of major structures and premises; structures; and characteristics of uses which were lawful but would be prohibited, regulated or restricted by the enactment of this chapter or a subsequent amendment thereto. Nonconformity may also be created where lawful public taking or auctions pursuant to a court order have the same effect as violations of this chapter, if undertaken privately. 
(Code 1972, § 26-9.1; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991) 
Sec. 102-382. - Intent concerning nonconformities generally. 
(a)	It is the intent of this chapter to require the cessation of certain nonconformities and to permit others to continue until they are removed or cease, but not to encourage their survival. 
(b)	It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformity shall not be used as grounds for addition of other prohibited uses or structures on the site or in the area, nor the enlarging by means or structures on the site or in the area, nor the enlarging by means of extension of expansion, except as specifically provided by this chapter. 
(c)	All rights and obligations associated with a nonconforming status run with the land and are not personal to the present ownership or tenant of the land, and are not affected by a change in ownership or tenancy, unless abandoned. (See sections 102-386 and 102-387(c).) 
(Code 1972, § 26-9.2; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991) 
Sec. 102-383. - Intent concerning nonconforming uses. 
    It is the intent of this chapter that nonconforming uses be considered incompatible with the permitted uses within the districts. Such nonconforming uses shall not be intensified, enlarged or extended in any respect. 
(Code 1972, § 26-9.3; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991) 
Sec. 102-384. - Special uses not to be considered nonconforming. 
    Any existing use which would require special use permit approval under the terms of this chapter shall be deemed a conforming use. However, enlargement, replacement or modification of such a use shall require approval of a special use permit application, as though it were a new use. 
(Code 1972, § 26-9.4; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991) 
Sec. 102-385. - Nonconforming lots. 
(a)	Use of single nonconforming lots for a single-family dwelling. In residential districts, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory structures may be erected, occupied and used on a separate, nonconforming lot of record, which is not in continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership (except as provided in subsection (c) below) in accord with other requirements applying in the district in which the lot is situated. 
(b)	Use of single nonconforming lots for nonresidential uses. In other than residential districts, a nonconforming lot of record, which is not in continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership (except as provided in subsection (c) below), may accommodate uses permitted within that district in accord with other requirements applying in that district. 
(c)	Rules concerning combination of contiguous nonconforming lots in same ownership and with continuous frontage; exception. 
(1)	Combination required where nonconforming status was created at enactment or amendment of this chapter. Where two or more nonconforming lots in single ownership and with continuous frontage exist, they shall be considered a single zoning lot and a zoning clearance permit authorizing their use shall only be issued when the lot area and lot width requirements for the district in which the lots are located are satisfied, except as provided in subsection (2) below. Full setback requirements shall apply to all of the newly created combined lots. 
(2)	Exception, 85 percent rule applicable where three lots or less are created. Where land in single ownership, at the time of passage of this chapter, and in continuous frontage is of sufficient width and area to provide at least 85 percent of the width required for three lots or less, it may be used or divided to provide no more than three lots,, each with at least 85 percent of the width required in the district in which they are located. Full setback requirements shall apply to all of the newly created combined lots. 
(3)	Rules for other combinations of lots. Land in single ownership and common frontage of greater dimension than in subsection (2) above, if divided, shall conform to all applicable district regulations, except that in the division, one remaining lot may have no less than 85 percent of width generally required. Full setback requirements shall apply to all of the newly created combined lots. 
(4)	Combination not required where nonconformity created by public or court order. Where the nonconforming lots were created by the exercise of the power of eminent domain or threat thereof, or as a result of a court order, combination of the lots shall not be required.

Sec. 102-386. - Nonconforming uses of land without structures or with minor structures. 
(a)	Nonconforming uses of land not involving any permanent structure with a replacement cost of more than $2,000.00 or a combination of permanent structures with a replacement cost not exceeding $5,000.00, as determined by the planning director, shall cease within two years of the adoption of this chapter, or any amendment which shall cause such uses to assume nonconforming status. 
(b)	In making determinations regarding replacement costs, the planning director shall use the Dodge Reports, Marshall Swift, or their successors, as a basic reference. 
(c)	Prior to termination, the following limitations shall apply: 
(1)	There shall be no enlargement, increase in intensity or alterations to the use, its permanent structure or both. 
(2)	If the use ceases for more than 90 consecutive days or a total of 180 days in a one-year period, subsequent use of the premises shall conform to the district regulations. 
(3)	No such use shall be relocated or moved to any portion of the lot other than that occupied at the time that nonconforming status was created. 
(4)	No such land shall be subdivided nor any structure added, except for purposes and in a manner conforming to district regulations. Subdivision, however, which does not increase the degree of nonconformity shall be permitted.

Sec. 102-387. - Nonconforming uses of major structures, or structures and premises in combination. 
(a)	Nonconforming use of structures with a value higher than specified in section 102-386, or of such structures and premises in combination, may be continued, provided: 
(1)	Such uses may not be enlarged, extended, altered or replaced, except for a change to a use permitted in the district in which located, except as provided in subsections (2) and (5) below. 
(2)	A nonconforming use may be extended through portions of a building manifestly arranged or intended for such use, but not otherwise extended, and shall not extend to occupy land outside such building or any additional building not used for such nonconforming use at the time that nonconforming status was established. 
(3)	If a nonconforming use ceases for a total of more than 180 days in any consecutive two-year period, subsequent use shall conform to the regulations of the district in which located. 
(4)	When a building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use is damaged or deteriorated, as determined by the planning director, to the extent of 50 percent or more of the building's or structure's assessed taxable value, such building, if restored, shall thereafter be devoted to conforming uses. 
(5)	Any nonconforming single-family dwelling may be altered, repaired, enlarged or replaced with a single-family dwelling, provided that the altered or replaced structure meets the dimensional requirements of this chapter for the district in which it is located. 
(b)	A nonconforming manufactured home may be replaced if the replacement structure is a Class A manufactured home, as defined by this chapter. 
(c)	A single-family dwelling may be replaced with either a Class A or Class B manufactured home if manufactured homes are a permitted use in the district, or the nonconforming use is a manufactured home, or the nonconforming use is located in a business or industrial district.

    A structure, other than signs, which is nonconforming due to noncompliance with the dimensional requirements of the official schedule of district regulations of this chapter, and which is used for a use permitted in the district in which it is located, may remain, provided: 
(1)	That any structural change to the structure shall not increase the degree of nonconformity. Structural changes which decrease or do not affect the degree of nonconformity shall be permitted. 
(2)	A nonconforming structure, or a portion thereof, if damaged, deteriorated or destroyed to the extent of more than 60 percent or more of its current assessed valuation, may only be reconstructed in accordance with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(3)	Routine repairs and maintenance of a nonconforming structure, fixtures, wiring and plumbing or the repair or replacement of walls shall be permitted. 
(Code 1972, § 26-9.8; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991)

It shall be unlawful for an owner of any structure affected by this chapter to discontinue, change or dispense with, or cause the discontinuance or change of the required vehicle parking or loading space apart from the discontinuance of such structure, without establishing alternative parking and loading space which meets the requirements of and is in compliance with this chapter. 
(Code 1972, § 26-10.3; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991) 
Sec. 102-424. - Methods of providing required parking. 
    All required parking shall be located on the same zoning lot as the principal use(s) it serves, except as provided below. In lieu of actual construction of required on-site parking spaces, all or any portion of the off-street parking required in this article may be provided as follows: 
(1)	Required parking for a use on a zoning lot may be located on another zoning lot, either by itself or combined with parking for other uses, subject to certification by the planning director that the following requirements have been met: 
a.	The use being served by the off-site parking shall be a permitted principal use as established in article IV of this chapter in the zoning district within which the zoning lot containing such parking is located. 
b.	The off-site parking spaces shall be located within 300 feet walking distance of a public entrance to the structure or land area containing the use for which such spaces are required. A safe, direct, attractive, lighted and convenient pedestrian route shall exist or be provided between the off-site parking and the use being served. 
c.	The continued availability of off-site parking spaces, necessary to meet the requirements of this article, shall be ensured by an appropriate reciprocal easement, satisfactory to the office of the city attorney and recorded with the register of deeds of the county. 
d.	For purposes of determining applicable minimum and maximum intensities, the land area devoted to off-site parking shall be added to the land area of the zoning lot containing the use being served by such parking and shall be subtracted from the area of the zoning lot containing the off-site parking. 
e.	The provision of off-site required off-street parking shall only occur in industrial, commercial and office districts. 
f.	Off-site required off-street parking shall not be separated from the use it serves by arterial or collector streets, as shown on the thoroughfare plan and the collector street plan, or other similar physical barriers to convenient access between the parking and the use. 
(2)	Parking, whether required or not, for an industrial or commercial use on an abutting (streets excluded), residential or office and institution zoning lot may be allowed as a Class A special use, subject to standards applicable to individual special uses contained in section 102-468(17).

Sec. 102-425. - Joint use facilities and shared parking. 
(a)	Nothing in the chapter shall be construed to prevent the joint use of off-street parking or off-street loading space for two or more structures or uses, if the total of such spaces, when used together, will not be less than the sum of the requirements of the various individual uses computed separately in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. An agreement for such joint use, in the form of a reciprocal easement acceptable to the city attorney shall be filed with the planning director and recorded with the register of deeds of the county. 
(b)	No part of an off-street parking area or off-street loading area required for any structure or use for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this chapter shall be included as a part of an off-street parking area or off-street loading area similarly required for another structure or use, unless the planning director determines that the period(s) of peak demands for off-street parking for such structures or uses will not be simultaneous with or overlap each other. An agreement, with the city as one of the parties with a right of enforcement, for such joint use, in the form of a reciprocal easement acceptable to the city attorney shall be filed with the planning director and recorded with the county register of deeds.

(Code 1972, § 26-10.8; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991; Ord. No. 92.44, § 1, 8-4-1992) 
Sec. 102-429. - Landscaping standards for off-street parking. 
(a)	Purpose. It is the intent of this section to protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by requiring the landscaping of parking areas which will serve to control access, enhance safety, reduce radiant heat from surfaces, reduce wind and air turbulence, reduce noise, reduce the glare of motor vehicles and surfaces, ameliorate stormwater drainage problems, filter automotive exhaust, and protect and preserve the appearance, character, and value of adjacent properties. 
(b)	Applicability. The landscaping requirements of this section shall apply to all new land development, public and private, designated as multifamily, recreational, office or institutional, commercial or industrial land uses. It is the intent of this section to encourage but not to require compliance with these standards whenever existing structures and/or uses are enlarged or expanded and additional parking is required by this chapter. 
(c)	Predevelopment site review. Site plans for proposed development shall comply with the requirements of this section prior to issuance of a zoning permit. Such plans shall be reviewed and approved by the planning director. 
(d)	Landscaping requirements. 
(1)	Street yards. The minimum width of the street yard, as defined in section 102-7, shall be ten feet measured from and parallel to the public street right-of-way.

Explanation: 
E = Evergreen 
D = Deciduous 
S = Sunny location 
SPS = Full sun to shady locations 
a.	Each shrub shall have a minimum amount of planting space based on the mature height of the shrub. 
1.	A small shrub having a mature height of less than four feet will have a minimum of nine square feet of planting space, a three-foot by three-foot square surface area. 
2.	A medium shrub having a mature height of less than eight feet will have a minimum of 16 square feet of planting space, a four-foot by four-foot square surface area. 
b.	The planting surface of each shrub can touch the planting space of another shrub or tree but cannot overlap each other or be covered with a nonporous material, such as a concrete sidewalk. This is to provide sufficient room for good foliage and root development of each shrub and tree. 
(2)	Interior areas of parking lots. The area(s) within the property used for vehicular storage, parking and movement shall provide landscaping as follows: The size of the mature tree to be used in a specific area should be based on the width of the planting area. 
Small trees (mature height of less than 30 feet) should have a planting width of at least four feet and an open area of at least 24 square feet. Minimum planting area is a four-foot by six-foot rectangle. 
Medium trees (mature height less than 45 feet) should have a planting width of at least six feet and an open space of at least 60 square feet. Minimum planting area is a six-foot by ten-foot rectangle. 
Large trees (mature height greater than 45 feet) should have a planting area of at least ten feet and an open space of at least 160 square feet. Minimum planting area is a ten-foot by 16-foot rectangle. 
a.	One small tree shall be required for every ten parking spaces or one medium tree shall be required for every 15 or fewer parking spaces; or one large tree for every 20 or fewer spaces; or a combination of tree sizes based on the number of parking spaces and the size of the planting area. The following example is given for illustrative and guidance purposes in the application of this subsection: 
A parking lot having 38 parking spaces total would require a minimum of four small trees, or three medium trees, or two large trees, or two small trees and one large tree, or two small and two medium trees, or one small, one medium, and one large tree. 
b.	One small shrub shall be required for every five or fewer parking spaces; or one medium shrub for every ten parking spaces; or a combination of small and medium shrubs based on the number of parking spaces, the amount of planting space available and any sight elevation problems that may be encountered in the parking lot. 
c.	The minimum size of the planting area will be based on the total minimum square foot area required by each shrub and tree to be planted in that area. The following example is given for illustrative and guidance purposes in the application of this section: 
One medium tree and four small shrubs are to be planted in a traffic island. The minimum size of the planting area will be: 
One medium tree: One by 60 square feet. 
Four small shrubs: Four by nine square feet. 
Total area needed: 96 square feet. 
d.	Required trees and shrubs shall be distributed throughout the vehicular area and placed as landscaped islands at each end of parking aisles to assist in traffic delineation and control. 
e.	Planting areas shall comply with the specified calculations at a minimum and shall be protected from vehicular encroachment by curbing or wheel stops at least six inches in height. 
f.	No more than 50 percent of trees may be evergreen and at least 50 percent of shrubs shall be evergreen. 
g.	All tree planting areas not affected by turf grass or low-growing ground cover shall be adequately mulched with organic material, such as shredded bark or pine needles, to conserve moisture and discourage growth of noxious weeds. Small stone or gravel is acceptable as mulch in landscaped areas when used in conjunction with a landscape fabric. 
(3)	Separation from structures: All parking areas, unless located on or within a structure, shall be separated from the exterior wall of a structure exclusive of paved pedestrian entranceways or loading areas by a buffer strip of at least five feet in width, which shall be landscaped with mulch, pine straw, small gravel or stone and shrubs. 
(e)	Maintenance. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner, or, in the event of a property transfer, the subsequent property owner, to maintain and ensure the survival of the plant material and planting areas in perpetuity. Plants and trees that do not survive planting or for some reason succumb to injury, disease and/or insect infestation must be replaced during the first planting season following the death of the plant(s) in accordance with the specifications of this section. 
(f)	Performance guarantee. 
(1)	Landscape and tree planting requirements may be deferred to an appropriate planting season, based on a decision made by the planning director, in order to facilitate a property owner's desire to obtain a certificate of occupancy. This provision is meant to allow for seasonal extremes in weather and soil conditions which may be incompatible to landscaping. It is not, however, meant to be used in any way to circumvent the intent and purpose of this section. No certificate of occupancy shall be approved until: 
a.	The required landscaping is completed in accordance with the approved plan; or 
b.	A bond or certified check, payable to the City of Newton, in the amount of 100 percent of the estimated cost is submitted to assure installation of the required landscaping. The amount of the bond shall be submitted by the developer and reviewed and determined by the city staff to be acceptable; 
An irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank in a form approved by the city attorney may be accepted in lieu of bond under the terms and conditions applicable to bonds in subsection b above. No surety or portion thereof, as provided for in this section, shall be released by the city until all landscaping has been installed, inspected and approved. 
(2)	Exceptions for underground and above-ground parking structures. When parking is provided underground or within buildings, the above requirements shall not apply. 
(Code 1972, § 26-10.9; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991; Ord. No. 97.7, § 2, 1-23-1997) 
Sec. 102-430. - Required off-street loading space. 
(a)	Every use requiring the receipt or distribution, by vehicles, of materials and merchandise shall have one or more loading berths or other space for standing, loading and unloading on the same or adjoining premises. Loading space shall be sufficient to allow normal loading and unloading operations of a kind and magnitude appropriate to the property served. Also, a required loading space shall be available for the loading and unloading of vehicles and shall not be used for the storage of vehicles or materials, or to meet off-street parking requirements, or in conducting the use. 
(b)	The requirements in Table 9-4 shall apply to new structures or additions to structures, and shall not be considered to make any existing structure nonconforming for lack of such off-street loading.

(1)	Off-street loading spaces shall be located and arranged so that a semitrailer truck (WB-50 class) shall be able to gain access to and use such spaces. 
(2)	Loading space shall observe the minimum street and interior setbacks established for structures. 
(3)	All loading space and maneuvering space shall be surfaced with an all-weather material which shall be maintained in a safe, sanitary, and neat condition. 
(4)	No loading space shall be located so that a vehicle using such space intrudes on or hinders the use of the public right-of-way, or adjacent properties. 
(5)	Each required off-street loading space shall have a minimum width of 12 feet and a minimum vertical clearance of 16 feet above finished grade of the space.

ARTICLE X. - SPECIAL USES 

Sec. 102-461. - Intent. 
    It is the intention of the council to create, and from time to time amend, a list of special uses within the table of permitted uses which, because of their inherent nature, extent and external effects, require special care in the control of their location and methods of operation. The council is aware of its responsibility to protect the public health, safety and general welfare and believes that certain uses which, now or in the future, may be included on this list are appropriately handled as special uses, subject to review in relation to general and specific requirements, rather than as uses permitted by right. In addition to the listing of such uses, the council intends that the general standards, established in section 102-462, and the more specific requirements, established below, shall be used by the board of adjustment, the city planning and zoning commission, and the council, as appropriate, to direct deliberations upon applications for the approval of special uses. It is the express intent of the council to delineate the areas of concern connected with each special use and provide standards by which applications for such special use shall be evaluated. 
(Code 1972, § 26-11.1; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991; Ord. No. 2002.31, 8-21-2002)

(18)	Telecommunications towers. The purpose of this subsection is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this subsection are to: (a) encourage the location of towers in nonresidential/nonhistorical areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community, (b) enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently, (c) encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites, (d) encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal, and (e) encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas. Communication companies are encouraged to locate telecommunication antennae on or in structures other than a tower. Such structures may include church steeples, transmission line towers, utility/light poles, water towers, etc. Where such facilities are not available, co-location of facilities is encouraged. When a new tower is proposed to be sited, a determination of whether the location will provide a minimal level of coverage vs. optimal coverage shall be taken into consideration. The following standards shall be used in the approval of the siting of new towers: 
a.	Evidence that the applicant has investigated the possibilities for locating the proposed facilities on an existing tower where a minimal level of coverage can be provided. Such evidence shall consist of: 
1.	Copies of letters sent to owners of all existing towers within a one-mile radius of the proposed site, requesting the following information: 
i.	Tower height; 
ii.	Existing and planned tower uses; 
iii.	Whether the existing tower could accommodate the proposed antenna without causing instability or radio frequency interference; and 
iv.	If the proposed antenna cannot be accommodated on the existing tower, an assessment of whether the existing tower could be structurally strengthened or whether the antenna's transmitters and related equipment could be protected from electromagnetic interference, and a general description of the means and projected cost of shared use of the existing tower. 
2.	A copy of all responses within 30 days from the mailing date of the letter required by subsection a.1. 
3.	A summary explanation of why the applicant believes the proposed facility cannot be located on an existing tower. 
4.	A summary explanation of why the applicant believes that the use of an alternative tower structure is not possible. 
5.	Provision of sound engineering evidence demonstrating that location in the proposed district is necessary in the interest of public safety or is a practical necessity. 
b.	Evidence that the communications tower is structurally designed to support at least one additional user, and the special use application includes a statement that the owner of the tower is willing to permit other user(s) to attach communication facilities, on a commercially reasonable basis, which do not interfere with the primary purpose of the tower. The tower owner may require that such other users agree to negotiate reasonable compensation to the owner from any liability which may result from such attachment. The site plan shall indicate a location for at least one equipment building in addition to that proposed for use by the applicant. Priority for co-location on the proposed tower shall be given to antennas that will serve a public safety need for the community. 
c.	Buffering and screening of the site shall be installed in accordance with sections 102-290 and 102-292. In order to provide spatial separation and create visual block from adjacent properties and streets, a buffer and screening shall be installed around the outside of all improvements on the site, including the tower and guy anchors, any ground buildings or equipment, and security fencing. Ground buildings located in a residential district may be located outside the buffered area if they are constructed so the exterior appearance of the building has the appearance of a residential dwelling, including pitched roof and frame or brick veneer construction. The applicant shall submit sealed elevations of such buildings to assist in the evaluations of compliance with the appearance criteria. The tower's guy anchors may be screened or fenced separately in order to comply with the requirements of this subsection. 
d.	The base of the tower and each guy anchor shall be surrounded by a security fence or wall at least eight feet in height, unless the tower and all guy anchors are mounted entirely on a building over eight feet in height. The tower's guy anchors may be screened or fenced separately in order to comply with the requirements of this subsection. 
e.	No outside storage shall be allowed on any telecommunication facility site. 
f.	Associated buildings located in any residential district shall not be used as an employment center for any worker. This provision does not prohibit the periodic maintenance or periodic monitoring of equipment and instruments. 
g.	The telecommunications tower shall meet all applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) standards and shall not restrict or interfere with air traffic or air travel from or to any existing or proposed airport. Any lighting shall not project onto surrounding residential property. 
h.	The minimum lot size requirement shall be in accordance with Table 4-2, Schedule of Area, Height, Bulk, and Placement Regulations, based upon the zoning district where the tower is proposed to be located or the setback requirements of subsection l., whichever is greater. 
i.	The color of the tower shall be neutral, except to the extent required by federal law, so as to minimize its visual impact. 
j.	In order to protect the public for unnecessary exposure to electromagnetic radiation, the tower shall provide documentation, such as a signed affidavit from a professional engineer, indicating that the power density levels do not exceed levels certified by the FCC. 
k.	No commercial advertising shall be allowed on the facility's site. 
l.	Setback of the base of the tower from all adjacent property lines shall be one foot for each foot in tower height. This setback may be reduced by the board of adjustment upon a finding that failure to grant a setback reduction would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, that the reduction serves the general intent and purpose of this section and the adopted comprehensive land development plan, and that the reduction will not substantially interfere with or injure the rights of others whose property would be affected by the reduced setback. In no case shall the setback be reduced to less than 50 percent of the tower height. To encourage shared use of towers, applications for towers which will operate with more than one user immediately upon completion may have a ten percent reduction in the required setbacks, but in no case shall the setback be less than those required for the underlying zoning district. Also, to encourage the construction of monopole structures, monopole towers may have a 20 percent reduction in the required setbacks. To encourage location of towers in existing forested areas with a minimum depth of 65 feet, the tower may have a 20 percent reduction in the required setbacks. In no case shall the setback be less than those required for the underlying zoning district. Such setback reductions shall only be allowed upon a professional engineering certification which states that the structure's construction will cause the tower to crumble inward so that, in the event of collapse, no damage to structures on adjacent zoning lots will result. 
m.	Notice shall be provided to the planning director when the tower is placed out of service. Towers which are not used for a period of six months or more shall be removed by the owner within 120 days of receipt of notification to that effect. 
(19)	Sexually oriented business as a principal use. The following standards shall be used in deciding an application for approval of these uses: 
a.	The sexually oriented business shall be conducted entirely within an enclosed building so that viewing, display, or sound from inside the building cannot be experienced outside the walls of the building. 
b.	There shall not be more than one sexually oriented business establishment on the same property or in the same building, structure, or portion thereof. 
c.	Except for an adult motel, no use permitted as a sexually oriented business as defined by chapter 22, article VI, may have sleeping quarters. 
d.	No more than one sexually oriented business can be located within a 1,000 foot radius, determined by a straight line and not street distance, from any part of a structure occupied by a sexually oriented business to any part of a structure occupied by another sexually oriented business within or without the city's zoning jurisdiction. 
e.	No part of a structure within which a sexually oriented business is conducted shall be located within a 200-foot radius (determined by a straight line and not street distance) of the closest boundary line of any (R) or (PD-H) residential district, or any church, public or private school, child care center, public park or playground within or without the city's zoning jurisdiction. 
f.	No sexually oriented business shall be issued a certificate of occupancy until all city licensing requirements set forth in chapter 22, article VI have been met. Further, the establishment shall comply with all requirements of G.S. 14-202.11. 
g.	The maximum gross floor area (GFA) of a principal building or structure which is occupied by a sexually oriented business shall be 5,000 square feet. 
h.	A sexually oriented business shall be permitted one wall mounted sign not to exceed 50 square feet. Further, such signs shall not contain materials, words, objects, images or displays that suggest or relate to specified anatomical areas and/or specified sexual activities as defined by G.S. 14-190.13. No freestanding or portable signs shall be permitted. No other advertising, displays or other promotional materials shall be visible to the public from pedestrian sidewalks, walkways, or vehicular areas. 
i.	Sexually oriented businesses shall comply with all off-street parking, buffer and screening regulations of this Code. 
(20)	Antique shops as an accessory use. The following specific standards shall be used in deciding an application of such uses: 
a.	The use shall occupy an accessory structure on the same lot or tract as the principal residential structure. 
b.	The structure shall be placed on a minimum lot size of two acres. 
c.	The maximum floor area ratio should not exceed 0.05; the total floor area shall not exceed 13,068 square feet. 
d.	The proposed site shall front on an arterial street as defined by the collector street plan. 
e.	The buffers and screening shall be the same as the Group 2 as defined in section 102-290. 
f.	The signage is limited to 16 square feet nonilluminated. 
g.	At the time of application a list of items to be sold shall be submitted in conjunction with the special use application. 
h.	The application for the special use permit shall include an approved driveway permit from NCDOT. 
i.	Whenever possible, the applicant shall reuse existing structures or construct new structures that compliment the surrounding neighborhood. 
j.	All new structures and parking areas shall meet required minimum setbacks.

ARTICLE XI. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT 

Sec. 102-491. - Districts, generally. 
(a)	Within districts now existing or which may hereafter be created, it is intended to permit establishment of new planned development (PD) districts for specialized purposes where tracts, suitable in location, area and character for the uses and structures proposed, are to be planned and developed on a unified basis. Suitability of tracts for the development proposed shall be determined primarily by reference to the adopted land development plan and to the performance standards of the separate categories of planned developments, with due consideration given to the existing and prospective character of surrounding development. 
(b)	Planned development districts shall be so related to the general development pattern and the objectives of the adopted land development plan as to provide for comfort and convenience of residents, facilitate protection of the character of surrounding neighborhoods, and reduce automotive traffic congestion by a reasonably close relationship (either in distance or in time) between origins and destinations of persons living, working or visiting in such developments. Housing, commercial and service facilities, and principal places of employment shall be so related by physical proximity and by major street networks as to promote these objectives. 
(c)	Within PD districts, regulations adapted to such unified planning and development are intended to accomplish the purposes of zoning and other applicable regulations to an equivalent or higher degree than where such regulations are intended to control unscheduled development on individual lots; such regulations are designed to promote economical and efficient land use, and improved level of amenities, appropriate and harmonious variety, creative design and a better environment. 
(d)	In view of the substantial public advantages of planned development, it is the intent of these regulations to promote and encourage development in this form where appropriate in location and character. 
(Code 1972, § 26-14.1; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991) 
Sec. 102-492. - Definition. 
    For purposes of this chapter, a planned development is: 
(1)	Land under unified control to be planned and developed as a whole; 
(2)	In a single development operation or a definitely programmed series of development operations, including all lands and buildings; 
(3)	For principal and accessory structures and uses substantially related to the character and purposes of the district; 
(4)	According to comprehensive and detailed plans which include not only streets, utilities, lots or building sites and the like, but also site plans for all buildings as intended to be located, constructed, used and related to each other, and plans for other uses and improvements on the land as related to the buildings; and 
(5)	With a program for provision, operation and maintenance of such areas, facilities and improvements as will be for common use by some or all of the occupants of the district, but which will not be provided, operated or maintained at general expense. 
(Code 1972, § 26-14.2; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991) 
Sec. 102-493. - Relation of PD regulations to general zoning, subdivision or other regulations; modifications on equal satisfaction of public purposes. 
(a)	The planned development regulations which follow shall apply generally to the initiation and regulation of all planned development districts. Where there are conflicts between the special PD regulations herein and general zoning, subdivision, or other regulations or requirements, these PD regulations shall apply in PD districts, unless the council finds, in the particular case, that provisions herein do not serve public purposes to a degree at least equivalent to such general zoning, subdivision or other regulations or requirements. 
(b)	Where actions, designs or solutions proposed by the applicant are not literally in accord with applicable PD or general regulations, but the council makes a finding, in the particular case, that public purposes are satisfied to an equivalent or greater degree, the council may make specific modification of the regulations in the particular case. However, where floor area and similar ratios, as well as maximum permitted densities, have been established by these regulations, the council shall not act, in a particular case, to modify such ratios or maximums. 
(c)	Except as indicated above, notwithstanding procedures and requirements generally in effect, procedures and requirements set forth herein for particular classes of PD districts shall apply in PD districts, to any amendments creating such districts, and to issuances of all required permits therein. 
(Code 1972, § 26-14.3; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991; Ord. No. 2002.31, 8-21-2002) 
Sec. 102-494. - Procedures and standards for establishing PD district; location. 
(a)	Planned development districts may hereafter be established by amendment to the official zoning atlas and related amendatory action, changing the designation of a lot from its existing classification to one of the several planned development districts contained in this article, where tracts suitable in location and character for the uses and structures proposed are to be planned and developed on a unified basis, according to the requirements and procedures set forth herein. 
(b)	Planned development districts shall be appropriately located with respect to intended functions, to the pattern and timing of development, in accordance with the adopted land development plan, and to public and private facilities existing or clearly to be available by the time the development reaches the stage where they will be needed. All requirements specified in article II, division 3 of this chapter, Amendments, shall be met, as well as the following specific requirements: 
(1)	Relation to major transportation facilities. PD districts shall be so located with respect to expressways, arterial and collector streets, and shall be so designed as to provide direct access to and from such districts without creating traffic along minor streets in residential neighborhoods outside the district. 
(2)	Relation to public utilities, facilities and services. 
a.	PD districts shall be so located in relation to sanitary sewers, water lines, storm and surface drainage systems and other utilities' systems and installations that neither extension nor enlargement of such systems will be required in manner, form, character, location, degree, scale or timing resulting in higher net public cost or earlier incursion of public cost than would development in forms generally permitted under current zoning and development policies for the area. 
b.	Such districts shall be so located with respect to necessary public facilities (as, for example, schools, parks and playgrounds in the case of planned development housing (PD-H) districts) as to have access to such facilities in the same degree as would development permitted under existing zoning and shall be so located, designed and scaled that access for public services is equivalent to, and net cost for such services is not greater than, access and net costs for public services for development as permitted under existing development controls. 
c.	However, if applicants will provide private facilities, utilities and services approved by appropriate public agencies as substituting on an equivalent basis, and assure their satisfactory continuing operation, permanently or until similar public utilities, facilities or services are available and used; or make provisions acceptable to the city for offsetting any added net public cost or early commitment of public funds made necessary by such development, the proposed PD district may be approved. 
d.	In computing net public costs, the difference in anticipated public installation, operation and maintenance costs and the difference in anticipated public revenue shall be considered. Expenses involved in making such determinations shall be paid by applicants. Determinations shall be made by the city or by experts acceptable to the city. 
(3)	Physical character of the site; relation to surrounding property. 
a.	The tract shall be suitable for development in the manner proposed without hazards to persons or property, on or off the tract, free from the probability of flooding, erosion, subsidence or slipping of the soil or other dangers. Conditions of soil, ground water level, drainage and topography shall all be appropriate to both the kind and pattern of use intended. 
b.	If appropriate to the form of planned development, lands to be included in PD districts may be divided by streets, alleys, rights-of-way or easements, but shall be so located, dimensioned and arranged as to permit unified planning and development and to meet all requirements in connection therewith, as well as to provide necessary protection against adverse relationships between uses in the district and uses in surrounding areas. 
(4)	Reduction or increase in minimum area generally required. In connection with a particular PD rezoning proposal, the council may approve as part of the amendment action: 
a.	Lesser areas than generally required upon findings, in the particular case, that special circumstances require such reduction, and the other requirements can be met in such lesser area, provided that no such reduction shall amount to more than ten percent of the area generally required; or 
b.	Greater areas than generally required upon findings that, in the particular case, the proposed plan of development or the character of the property involved, in themselves or as it may reasonably be expected to develop, require such increase to meet the requirements and intent of PD zoning or to provide necessary special protection. 
(5)	Reclassification. Where existing developments exist, or proposed and previously approved developments are in progress, which are of a nature substantially in accord with the intent of these regulations, they may be reclassified to planned development status. 
(6)	Additions to PD districts not subject to minimum area requirements. Where planned development additions are proposed to existing PD districts, and where the land and the proposed plan of development are approximately related to the existing PD district and provided necessary safeguards in relation to the surrounding area, PD amendments allowing such additions may be made without regard to the minimum area classification as the PD district being added to, or may be of another classification, if the council approves the other classification, and proposed plans therefor as complementary to the original PD district.

Sec. 102-505. - Planned development housing (PD-H) districts. 
    The following regulations and requirements apply to planned development housing (PD-H) districts, defined for purposes of these regulations as planned development districts primarily for dwelling and related uses and facilities. 
(1)	Where permitted; intent concerning timing. PD-H districts may hereafter be established in accordance with the general procedures and requirements set forth in sections 102-495 through 102-504, and with intensities and in locations in accordance with the official zoning atlas. 
(2)	Permitted principal and accessory uses and structures. 
a.	Principal. 
1.	Dwellings, one-family, two-family and multiple family. 
2.	Churches. 
3.	Schools. 
4.	Noncommercial social, recreational and cultural facilities such as neighborhood or community centers, game rooms, library, golf courses, swimming pools, marinas, tennis courts and the like. 
5.	Structures and uses required for operation of a public utility, performance of a governmental function, or performance of any function necessary for the operation or maintenance of the planned development and otherwise permitted under these or general regulations, subject to the requirements thereof. 
b.	Accessory. Uses and structures which are customarily accessory and clearly incidental to permitted principal uses and structures, including, in a multifamily building or closely related complex of multifamily buildings having a total of at least 50 dwelling units, establishments for sale of convenience goods, eating and drinking establishments, and professional and personal service establishments, provided that the floor area occupied by all such establishments shall not total an amount in excess of ten percent of the residential floor area of such multiple family building or complex. Such establishments shall be designed and scaled to meet only the requirements of occupants and their guests. There shall be no evidence of such establishments from any public street. 
(3)	Minimum land areas (revisions 11-14-1990). The minimum gross land area required for creation of a PD-H district in each zoning district shall be: 
District Square Footage Acreage R-20 217,800 5 R-20A 217,800 5 R-11 174,240 4 R-9 120,000 2.75 R-7  87,120 2.00 R-7A  87,120 2.00  
(4)	Maximum allowed intensity of residential development permitted. The maximum permitted intensity of residential development within the various zoning districts shall be as shown in Table 4-2. 
(5)	Site planning. 
a.	External relationships. Site planning within the district shall provide protection of the development from potentially adverse surrounding influences and protection of surrounding areas from potentially adverse influences within the development. In particular: 
1.	Vehicular access points. Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Merging and turnout lanes or traffic dividers and extra width of the approach street shall be required where existing or anticipated heavy flows indicate need. In general, minor streets shall not be connected with streets outside the districts in such a way as to encourage use of such minor streets by substantial amounts of through traffic. 
2.	Access for pedestrians and cyclists. Access for pedestrians and cyclists entering or leaving the district shall be by safe and convenient routes. Such access need not be adjacent to, or limited to the vicinity of, vehicular access points. Where there are crossings of pedestrian ways and vehicular routes at edges of planned developments, such crossings shall be safely located, marked and controlled, and where such ways are exposed to substantial vehicular traffic at edges of districts, safeguards may be required to prevent crossings except at designated points. Bicycle or bridle paths, if provided, shall be so related to the pedestrian way system that street crossings are combined. 
3.	Protection of visibility. Protection of visibility for automotive traffic, cyclists and pedestrians shall be as generally provided in section 102-237. In addition, where there is pedestrian or bicycle access from within the development to a street at its edges by paths or across yards or other open space without a barrier to access to the street, no material impediment to visibility, as defined therein, shall be created to be maintained within areas appropriate to the circumstances of the case, but in any event within a visibility triangle equivalent to that required in section 102-237. 
4.	Uses adjacent to single-family residence districts. Where a PD-H district adjoins a single-family residence district without intervening permanent open space at least 100 feet in width serving as a separation for buildable areas, the portion of the perimeter of the PD-H district so adjoining shall be planned and developed only for uses permitted in the adjoining residential district and in accordance with all other requirements for such district; provided, however, that in lieu of development, common open space for the PD-H district to a depth of 100 feet from the district boundary may be permitted. No intensive recreational use or off-street parking shall be permitted within 75 feet of the district boundary in such circumstances. (See section 102-290.) The width of permanent open space, however, may be reduced from 100 feet to not less than 40 feet if screening in the form of natural landscape plantings, planted berms, walls, or fences is provided. Screening shall be encouraged in the form of natural landscape plantings. Where sufficient room exists to place a screen consisting of natural planting or maintain an existing screen of natural plantings, such natural plantings shall be used as the required form of screening. Otherwise, screening in the form of a planted berm, wall or fence may be used. The council may approve a combination of natural planting, berm, wall or fence, if they determine that the spirit and intent of this section are met by such combination. The council may also approve screening consisting of existing natural plantings where such plantings are of such height and depth to meet the intent and spirit of this section. 
i.	Natural plantings. Where natural plantings are used, a buffer strip shall be planted. This strip shall be free of all encroachment by structures, parking areas or other impervious surfaces (except driveways, sidewalks or other pedestrian or bicycle paths). The amount and type of buffer materials to be planted per 100 linear feet shall be five canopy trees, three understory trees, and 20 shrubs. 
A.	Canopy trees shall have a minimum caliper of two inches, measured six inches above the ground at the time of planting. 
B.	Understory trees shall have 11/2 inches minimum caliper, measured six inches above the ground at the time of planting. 
C.	Shrubs shall be evergreen and at least 24 inches tall when planted with an average height of five feet to be expected as normal growth within four years. 
The arrangement of trees and shrubs in the buffer area shall be done in a manner that provides a visual separation between abutting land uses. Shrubs shall be massed in rows or groups to achieve the maximum screening effect. All specifications for the measurement, quality, and installation of trees and shrubs shall be in accordance with the "American Standards for Nursery Stock" published by the American Association of Nurserymen, and free of disease and with the Manual of City Specifications. 
ii.	Walls or fences. Any wall shall be constructed in a durable fashion with a finished surface of brick, stone or other decorate masonry material approved by the council. Fences shall be constructed of wood in a durable fashion and of durable, weather-resistant wood fencing materials and of consistent pattern. No wall or fence shall be less then six feet nor greater than eight feet in height above grade unless approved by the council. All walls or fences used for screen purposes shall be opaque. 
iii.	Berms. All berms shall be planted with required plant material as specified under subsection i., Natural plantings. The only exemption is a permitted 25 percent reduction in the number of shrubs. Berms shall be a minimum height of four feet with a maximum slope of 3:1. Berms in excess of six feet in height shall have a maximum slope of 4:1 as measured from the exterior property line. All berms shall be planted with trees, shrubs and ground covers to prevent erosion and to leave no bare spots. In the event that it can be demonstrated that existing vegetation meets the intent of this section, the council may waive the requirements for plant materials. The council shall determine whether existing vegetation is acceptable. Required buffers shall not be disturbed for any reason except for required driveways, sidewalks, or other pedestrian or bicycle paths, walls, fences, or required landscaping, landscaping maintenance and construction of berms, or utility lines. 
5.	Screening at edge of district. Yards, fences, walls or vegetative screening at edges of PD-H districts shall be provided where needed to protect residents from undesirable views, lighting, noise or other offsite influences, or to protect occupants of adjoining residential districts from similar adverse influences within the PD-H district. In particular, extensive off-street parking areas and service areas for loading and unloading vehicles other than passenger, and areas for storage and collection of refuse and garbage shall be screened. 
6.	Height limitations at edge of district. Except along boundaries where adjoining districts permit greater heights within similar area, in addition to height limitations applying generally within PD-H districts, no portion of any building in such district shall project though imaginary planes leaning inward from district boundaries at an angle representing an increase in height of 0.5 foot for each foot of horizontal distance perpendicular to the district boundary. 
7.	Signs visible from outside district. No signs visible from outside PD-H districts shall be erected within such districts other than not to exceed two signs identifying the development, with total maximum surface area not to exceed 16 square feet, at each principal entrance to the development. In addition, during the process of construction and initial sale or rental within such development, temporary announcement signs may be allowed, as provided in section 102-348. 
b.	Internal relationships. The site plan shall provide for safe, efficient, convenient and harmonious grouping of structures, uses and facilities, for appropriate relation of space inside and outside buildings to intended uses and structural features, and for preservation of desirable natural features and minimum disturbance of natural topography. In particular: 
1.	Layout of streets, drives, parking and service areas. Streets, drives, parking and service areas shall provide safe and convenient access to dwelling units and general facilities, and for service and emergency vehicles. Streets shall not be so laid out as to encourage outside traffic to traverse the development on minor streets, nor occupy more than is required to provide access as indicated, nor create unnecessary fragmentation of the development into small blocks. In general, block size shall be the maximum consistent with use and shape of the site and the convenience and safety of occupants. 
2.	Vehicular access to streets. Vehicular access to streets shall be limited and controlled as follows: 
i.	If the street or portion thereof serves 50 or less dwelling units, vehicular access from off-street parking and service areas may be directly to the street from the sites of individual dwelling units. Determination of number of dwelling units served shall be based on normal routes of traffic anticipated in the development. 
ii.	Vehicular access to other streets or portions of streets from off-street parking and service areas shall be so combined, limited, located, designed and controlled as to channel traffic from and to such areas conveniently, safely and in a manner which minimizes marginal traffic friction and promotes free flow of traffic on streets without excessive interruption. 
3.	Ways for pedestrians and cyclists. 
i.	Walkways shall form a logical, safe and convenient system for pedestrian access to all dwelling units, project facilities, and principal off-site pedestrian destinations. Maximum walking distance in the open between dwelling units and parking areas, delivery areas and refuse and garbage storage areas intended for use of occupants shall not exceed 100 feet. 
ii.	Walkways to be used by substantial numbers of children as play areas or routes to school or other destinations shall be so located and safeguarded as to minimize contacts with normal automotive traffic. If substantial bicycle traffic is anticipated, bicycle paths shall be coordinated with the walkway system. Street crossings shall be held to a minimum on such walkways, shall be located and designed to promote safety, and shall be appropriately marked and otherwise safeguarded. 
iii.	Pedestrian ways and bicycle paths, appropriately located, designed and constructed, may be combined with other easements and used by emergency and service vehicles, but shall not be used by other automotive traffic, including motor bikes and motorcycles. 
4.	Protection of visibility for automotive traffic, cyclists and pedestrians. Protection of visibility for automotive traffic, cyclists and pedestrians shall be as provided at subsection (5)a above.

Sec. 102-506. - Planned development shopping center (PD-SC) districts. 
    The following regulations and requirements apply to planned development shopping center (PD-SC) districts, defined for purposes of these regulations as planned development districts for neighborhood, PD-SC(N); community, PD-SC(C); or regional, PD-SC(R) shopping centers: 
(1)	Where permitted; intent. PD-SC districts may hereafter be established in accordance with the general procedures and requirements as set forth in sections 102-495 through 102-504. It is the intent of these regulations to provide for development of such centers in scale with surrounding market areas, at locations appropriate, and in accord with standards set forth herein, to serve areas not already conveniently and adequately provided with commercial and service facilities of the kind proposed. It is further the intent to permit the establishment of such districts only where planned centers with carefully related buildings, parking and service areas, and landscaped open space will serve clearly demonstrated public need, reduce marginal traffic friction below that which would result from strip commercial development, and protect property values in surrounding neighborhoods. It is further intended that PD-SC districts shall provide a broad range of facilities and services appropriate to the general need of the area served. To these ends: 
a.	PD-SC(N). Planned development shopping center (neighborhood) districts are intended but not required to be built around a supermarket as the major use, and to provide for the sale of convenience goods, for provision of personal services, and for other frequent needs of a trade area within approximately one to ten minutes driving time and which do not exceed 50,000 square feet in size. PD-SC(N) centers shall be located only with direct access to, and preferably at intersections of, streets of a collector or more intensive category, or on suitable frontage roads adjacent to such streets. Access from minor streets is prohibited, except where such access would not encourage through traffic on such streets. 
b.	PD-SC(C). Planned development shopping center (community) districts are intended but not required to be built around a department store or substantial variety store as the major tenant, in addition to a supermarket. Such centers, which do not usually have a full-line department store, normally serve a trade area within ten to 15 minutes driving time. The size of these centers shall not be less than 50,000 square feet, and shall not exceed 100,000 square feet. PD-SC(C) centers shall be located only with direct access to, and preferably at intersections of, streets of a collector or more intensive category, or on suitable frontage roads adjacent to such streets. Access from minor streets is prohibited, except where such access would not encourage through traffic on such streets. 
c.	PD-SC(M). Planned development shopping center (major) districts are intended to be built around one or more full-time department stores, and to serve an area within 25 minutes driving time. PD-SC(M) centers shall be located only at intersections of arterial streets and controlled access roads, or on suitable frontage roads adjacent to such streets or to freeways, if near interchanges. Such centers may have secondary access to collector streets. Access from local streets is prohibited, except where such access would not encourage through traffic on such streets. 
(2)	Permitted principal and accessory uses and structures. The following principal and accessory uses and structures may be permitted in PD-SC districts, subject to the limitations and requirements set forth. The listings are intended to be illustrative (except where limitations are set forth) rather than rigidly inclusive, and PD-SC rezoning may be denied if a proposed center does not provide a sufficient range of establishments to provide for the general needs of the trade area proposed to be served. 
a.	PD-SC(N) districts.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2007.26, § 3, adopted August 7, 2007, repealed the former Art. XIII, §§ 102-581-102-593, and enacted a new Art. XIII as set out herein. The former Art. XIII pertained to similar floodway and floodway fringe regulations and derived from §§ 26-17.1-26-17.10.2 of the 1972 Code; Ord. No. 91.53, 10-16-1991. 

Sec. 102-581. - Legislative authority. 
    The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3, 5, and 8 of Article 19 of Chapter 160A; and Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
    The flood-prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Newton are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
    These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood-prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards. 
(Ord. No. 2007.26, § 3, 8-7-2007) 
Sec. 102-582. - Purpose and objectives. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood-prone areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)	Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities; 
(2)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)	Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
The objectives of this chapter are to: 
(1)	Protect human life, safety, and health; 
(2)	Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)	Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)	Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions; 
(5)	Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood-prone areas; 
(6)	Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas; and 
(7)	Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area. 
(Ord. No. 2007.26, § 3, 8-7-2007) 
Sec. 102-583. - General provisions. 
(a)	Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the City of Newton and its extra-territorial planning jurisdiction. 
(b)	Basis for establishing the special flood hazard areas. The special flood hazard areas are those identified under the cooperating technical state (CTS) agreement between the State of North Carolina and FEMA in its flood insurance study (FIS) and its accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM), for Catawba County dated September 5, 2007, which are herein adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. 
The initial flood insurance rate maps are as follows for the jurisdictional areas at the initial date: City of Newton and Catawba County, dated September 3, 1980. 
(c)	Establishment of zoning clearance permit. A zoning clearance permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities within special flood hazard areas determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection 102-583(b). 
(d)	Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, altered, or developed in any way without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(e)	Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(f)	Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
(1)	Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)	Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)	Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(g)	Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur. Actual flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Newton or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

(6)	Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this chapter. 
(7)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25.00 per $100.00 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance. 
(8)	The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State of North Carolina upon request. 
(9)	Conditions for variances: 
a.	Variances shall not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
b.	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or non-encroachment area if the variance would result in any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge. 
c.	Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
d.	Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit approval. 
e.	Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1.	A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
3.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(13)	All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(14)	All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have received all necessary permits from those governmental agencies for which approval is required by federal or state law, including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334. 
(15)	When a structure is partially located in a special flood hazard area, the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction and substantial improvements. 
(16)	When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in a flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood elevation shall apply. 
(b)	Specific standards. In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided, as set forth in section 102-583(b), or section 102-585(d), the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of section 102-585(a), are required: 
(1)	Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in article I, section 102-7 of this chapter. 
(2)	Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in article 1, section 102-7 of this chapter. Structures located in A, AE, AO, and A1-30 zones may be floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO zones, the floodproofing elevation shall be in accordance with section 102-585(g)(2). A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in section 102-584(b)(3), along with the operational and maintenance plans. 
(3)	Manufactured homes. 
a.	New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in this chapter. 
b.	Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured Homes adopted by the commissioner of insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15. Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is required. 
c.	All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the requirements of section 102-585(b)(4). 
d.	An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the floodplain administrator and the local emergency management coordinator. 
(4)	Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor: 
a.	Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms, except to enclose storage areas; 
b.	Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least to the regulatory flood protection elevation; 
c.	Shall include, in zones A, AO, AE, and A1-30, flood openings to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum design criteria: 
1.	A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.	The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;

4.	The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher than one foot above the adjacent grade; 
5.	Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; and 
6.	Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above. 
(5)	Additions/improvements. 
a.	Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are: 
1.	Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-conforming than the existing structure. 
2.	A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new construction. 
b.	Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction. 
c.	Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are: 
1.	Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction. 
2.	A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new construction. 
(6)	Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either: 
a.	Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently attached additions); or 
b.	Meet all the requirements for new construction. 
(7)	Temporary non-residential structures. Prior to the issuance of a zoning clearance permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must submit to the floodplain administrator a plan for the removal of such structure(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the floodplain administrator for review and written approval: 
a.	A specified time period for which the temporary use will be permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one year; 
b.	The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible for the removal of the temporary structure; 
c.	The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or immediately upon flood warning notification); 
d.	A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity responsible for physical removal of the structure; and 
e.	Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside the special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be moved. 
(8)	Accessory structures. When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages, etc.) are to be placed within a special flood hazard area, the following criteria shall be met: 
a.	Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation (including working, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas); 
b.	Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled; 
c.	Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage potential; 
d.	Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;

g.	Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection elevation in conformance with the provisions of section 102-585(b)(4)c. 
An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet that satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an elevation or floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing certifications are required for all other accessory structures in accordance with section 102-584(b)(3). 
(c)	Reserved. 
(d)	Standards for floodplains without established base flood elevations. Within the special flood hazard areas designated as approximate zone a and established in section 102-583(b), where no base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of section 102-585(a), shall apply: 
(1)	No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20 feet each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream, whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)	The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be determined based on the following criteria: 
a.	When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this article and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in section 102-585(a) and (b). 
b.	When floodway data is available from a federal, state, or other source, all new construction and substantial improvements within floodway areas shall also comply with the requirements of section 102-585(b) and (f). 
c.	All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if development is greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in accordance with section 102-583(b) and utilized in implementing this chapter. 
d.	When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a federal, state, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be elevated or floodproofed (nonresidential) to or above the "regulatory flood protection elevation", as defined in article I, section 102-7. All other applicable provisions of section 102-585(b) shall also apply. 
(e)	Standards for riverine floodplains with BFE but without established floodways or non-encroachment areas. Along rivers and streams where BFE data is provided by FEMA or is available from another source but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS report, the following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas: 
(1)	Standards of section 102-585(a) and (b); and 
(2)	Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
(f)	Floodways and non-encroachment areas. Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within the special flood hazard areas established in section 102-583(b). The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in section 102-585(a) and (b), shall apply to all development within such areas: 
(1)	No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless: 
a.	It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice and presented to the floodplain administrator prior to issuance of zoning clearance permit; or 
b.	A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion of the proposed encroachment. 
(2)	If section 102-585(f)(1) is satisfied, all development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter. 
(3)	No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the following provisions are met: 
a.	The anchoring and the elevation standards of section 102-585(b)(3); and 
b.	The no encroachment standard of section 102-585(f)(1). 
(g)	Standards for areas of shallow flooding (zone AO). Located within the special flood hazard areas established in section 102-583(b), are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to section 102-585(a) and (b), all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)	The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), in feet, plus a freeboard of two feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. 
(2)	Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be floodproofed to the same level as required in section 102-585(g)(1) so that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below that level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required in accordance with section 102-584(b)(3) and section 102-585(b)(2). 
(3)	Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

A development plan based upon a survey prepared by a registered land surveyor shall be submitted upon application for a zoning clearance permit for all multifamily and nonresidential developments. The development plan shall show the boundaries of the property or properties upon which development will occur, all existing and proposed; structures, parking, loading, signs, landscaping, trees, natural features, utilities, walls and fences. 
e.	Plan review. All applications for a zoning clearance permit or certificate of occupancy shall be reviewed and approved by the planning director, director of public works, city engineer, city horticulturist, fire chief, police chief, and the district engineer of NCDOT. 
f.	Setbacks. The front yard setback shall be a minimum of 40 feet from the street right-of-way of all abutting arterial corridors as shown on the official zoning atlas for each of the corridor protection districts. No parking, structures or displays shall be placed within these setbacks. Signs shall be permitted within 15 feet from the street right-of-way. Driveways, open space, natural and proposed landscaping shall be permitted within these setbacks as approved. 
(2)	Parking and loading standards. 
a.	Loading. All loading areas and activities shall be located at the rear of all structures. Where loading areas located at the rear are visible from an adjoining street, they shall be effectively screened by a minimum six-foot-high fence with vegetative cover at least four feet high at planting, along the exterior of said fence. 
b.	Parking. All parking areas for nonresidential uses located at the front or side abutting a street shall be effectively screened by an earth berm or landscaping, which shall be at least four feet above parking lot grade at the time of occupancy. Earth berms shall be stabilized for erosion purposes with grass, mulch or a combination of ground covers and plantings as minimums. 
(3)	Signs. 
a.	Height. Nonresidential signs shall not exceed 35 feet in height or 35 feet above the elevation of the pavement of the street adjoining the sign location, whichever is greater. 
b.	Number. Only one free-standing sign shall be allowed for the entire site. Said free-standing sign shall be located at the frontage of the more major of intersecting thoroughfares or streets. 
c.	Off-premises signs. No off-premises signs of any type shall be permitted, except church and civic signs, as provided for in article VII of this chapter. Industrial land uses within 2,600 feet of US 321 South are permitted a directional sign provided a private easement or property ownership (non-contiguous) is obtained by said industry. 
d.	Directional signs. Signs permitted, provided they bear no advertising matter and do not exceed two square feet in area. Within the US 321 south protection corridor (SPI-2) as described within section 102-652, industrial land uses are permitted to install one directional sign no larger than 36 square feet in area bearing the industrial land use name and/or logo. If there are multiple industrial uses, one sign no larger than 60 square feet in area shall be permitted. 
(4)	Access and circulation. 
a.	Number of driveways permitted. A maximum of one driveway opening shall be permitted to a particular nonresidential development site or to residential projects with the potential for 50 units or more from each of any one or two abutting streets. Sites which either are occupied by a single-family dwelling or are proposed to be occupied by a single-family dwelling shall be exempt from this subsection. When, in the opinion of the city or NCDOT engineer, it is in the interests of good traffic operation, the board of adjustment may permit one additional driveway entrance along a continuous site with frontage in excess of 300 feet or two additional driveway entrances along a continuous site with frontage in excess of 600 feet. Where a dual-service driveway is used, it will be considered, for purposes of this section, to be only one direct-access driveway. In the case of dual one-way driveways, one pair may be used per 250 feet of frontage. Only one pair of one-way drives may be used per street frontage. 
b.	Driveway spacing. Sites which either are occupied by a single-family dwelling or are proposed to be occupied by a single-family dwelling shall be exempt from this subsection. 
Highway Speed Limit 
(mph) Minimum Spacing 
(feet) 35 150 45 230 50+ 275  
These spacings are based on average vehicle acceleration and deceleration rates and are considered necessary to maintain safe traffic operation. Spacing will be measured from the midpoint of each driveway. In the event that a particular parcel or parcels lack sufficient arterial frontage to maintain adequate spacing, the landowner(s) have one of two options: 
1.	They can seek a variance from the board of adjustment for minimum spacing, but in no case can the variance be greater than the next lowest classification on the table above. For example, on a 35 mph arterial requiring 150-foot spacing, the distance may not be reduced. 
2.	The adjacent landowners may agree to establish a common driveway. In such cases, the driveway midpoint should be the property line between the two parcels. The driveway must meet standard specifications, and the estimated driveway volume will be the sum of the trip-generation rate of both land uses in question. 
c.	Coordination of access. Provisions for circulation between adjacent parcels shall be provided through coordinated or joint parking areas whenever and wherever practicable as approved by the city engineer and NCDOT. Driveway placement should be such that loading and unloading activities will in no way hinder vehicle ingress and egress. Sites which are occupied by a single-family dwelling or are proposed to be occupied by a single-family dwelling shall be exempt from this subsection. 
d.	Turn lanes and tapers. When required by the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), left turn lanes and acceleration and deceleration lane tapers shall be provided for residential and nonresidential development. Required turn lanes and tapers shall be provided in accordance with NCDOT standards and approved by the NCDOT.

Single-family residential development shall not exceed one dwelling unit per acre (one du/ac) on a project by project basis. No residential lot shall be less than one acre (or 40,000 square feet excluding roadway right-of-way ) , except within an approved cluster development. All other residential and nonresidential development shall not exceed 12 percent built-upon area on a project by project basis. For the purpose of calculating built-upon area, the total project area shall include total acreage in the tract on which the project is to be developed. In such areas, curbs and gutters may not be installed at a later date either by the city, the state or private action unless the requirements of the high density option are met or an exemption is granted by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission. Measurements of built-upon area shall be based upon net project area excluding land within existing street rights-of-way. 
(3)	Jacob Fork Watershed Protection District Balance of Watershed (WS-III BW) (SPI-6BW) low density option. New development under this low density option does not have to employ wet detention ponds meeting the design standards of the North Carolina Division of Environmental Management as the primary treatment system for stormwater runoff. Single-family residential development shall not exceed two dwelling units per acre, as defined on a project by project basis. No residential lot shall be less than one-half acre (or 20,000 square feet excluding roadway right-of-way), except within an approved cluster development. All other residential and nonresidential development shall not exceed 24 percent built-upon area on a project by project basis. For the purpose of calculating built-upon area, total project area shall include total acreage in the tract on which the project is to be developed. In such areas, curbs and gutters may not be installed at a later date either by the city, the state or private action unless the requirements of the high density option are met or an exemption is granted by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission. Measurements of built-upon area shall be based upon net project area excluding land within existing street rights-of-way. 
(4)	High density option for all watershed protection districts . New development under the high density option must employ engineered storm water controls. Wet detention ponds designed by a North Carolina registered professional engineer and meeting the design standards of the North Carolina Division of Environmental Management must be employed under the high density option as the primary treatment system for storm water runoff. Engineered structures shall be so designed as to control runoff from the first one inch of rainfall. Under the high density option, built-upon area may not exceed the minimums as established in Table 14-2 in each watershed on a project-by-project basis.

Sec. 102-681. - Special procedures applicable to high density development. 
(a)	High density permit approval. Where underlying zoning or planned development districts permit densities exceeding the low density option limits, a high density development permit shall be required and must be approved prior to issuance of a zoning clearance permit or subdivision final plat approval for high density projects. Application for a high density development permit shall be addressed to the city council and submitted to the city council and submitted to the planning director at least 14 days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. The planning director shall consult with all applicable departments, including but not limited to the engineering, city attorney, public works, fire and public utilities departments, and shall prepare a report of findings and recommendations to be presented to the city council with the application. The planning director shall also submit copies of the application to the state division of environmental management's water quality section and division of land quality for comments and recommendations. Upon receipt of a completed application, the city council shall call for and hold a public hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be given according to the procedures established by section 102-126. The city council may also provide an opportunity for public agencies affected by the development proposal to review and make recommendations on the application, however, failure of such agencies to submit their comments and suggestions shall not delay the city council's action. The city council shall either approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove each application for a high density development permit based on the applicable criteria contained in this article. 
(1)	If the city council approves, or approves with modifications, the application based on its findings, such approval shall be indicated on the permit, both copies of the site plan and both copies of the plans and specifications of the storm water control structure. A high density development permit shall be issued after the applicant posts a performance bond or other acceptable security and executes an operation and maintenance agreement as required in subsection (b) of this section. A copy of the permit and one copy of each set of plans shall be kept on file at the planning director's office. The original permit and one copy of each set of plans shall be delivered to the applicant either by personal service or registered mail, return receipt requested. 
(2)	If the city council disapproves the application based on its findings, the reasons for such action shall be stated in the minutes and presented to the applicant in writing either by personal service or registered mail, return receipt requested. The applicant may make changes and submit a revised plan. All revisions shall be submitted, reviewed and acted upon by the city council pursuant to the procedures of this section. 
(b)	Financial security. 
(1)	Required. All new storm water control structures shall be conditioned on the posting of adequate financial assurance for the purpose of maintenance, repairs or reconstruction necessary for adequate performance of the storm water control structures. 
(2)	Form; amount. Financial assurance shall be in the form of the following: 
a.	Security performance bond or other security. The permit applicant shall obtain either a performance bond from a surety bonding company authorized to do business in North Carolina, an irrevocable letter of credit or other instrument readily convertible into cash at face value payable to the City of Newton or placed in escrow with a financial institution designated as an official depository of the city. The bond or other instrument shall be in an amount equal to 1.25 times the total cost of the stormwater control structure, as estimated by the applicant and approved by the city engineer. The total cost of the storm water control structure shall include the value of all materials such as piping and other structures; seeding and soil stabilization; design and engineering; and grading, excavation, fill, etc. The costs shall not be prorated as part of a larger project, but rather under the assumption of an independent mobilization. 
b.	Cash or equivalent security deposited after the release of the performance bond. 
Consistent with subsection (e) of this section, the permit applicant shall deposit with the city either cash or other instrument approved by the city attorney that is readily convertible into cash at face value. The cash or security shall be in an amount equal to 15 percent of the total cost of the storm water control structure or 100 percent of the estimated cost of maintaining the storm water control structure over a ten-year period, whichever is greater. The estimated cost of maintaining the storm water control structure shall be consistent with the approved operation and maintenance plan or manual provided by the developer under subsection (d) of this section. The amount shall be computed by estimating the maintenance cost for 25 years and multiplying this amount by two-fifths or 0.4.

The city shall return any funds not spent in completing the improvements to the owing entity. 
(5)	Default under cash security. Upon default of the owning entity to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the storm water control structure in accordance with the operation and maintenance agreement, the city shall obtain and use all or any portion of the cash security to make necessary improvements based on an engineering estimate. Such expenditure of funds shall only be made after exhausting all other reasonable remedies seeking the owing entity to comply with the terms and conditions of the operation and maintenance agreement. The city shall not return any of the deposited cash funds. 
(c)	Maintenance and upkeep . 
(1)	An operation and maintenance plan or manual shall be provided by the developer for each storm water control structure, indicating what operation and maintenance actions are needed, what specific quantitative criteria will be used for determining when those actions are to be taken, and, consistent with the operation and maintenance agreement, who is responsible for those actions. The plan shall clearly indicate the steps that will be taken for restoring a storm water control structure to design specifications if a failure occurs. 
(2)	Landscaping and grounds management shall be the responsibility of the owning entity. However, vegetation shall not be established or allowed to mature to the extent that the integrity of the control structure is diminished or threatened, or to the extent of interfering with any easement or access to the storm water control structure. 
(3)	Except for general landscaping and grounds management, the owning entity shall notify the planning director to any repair or reconstruction of the storm water control structure. All improvements shall be made consistent with the approved plans and specifications of the storm water control structure and the operation and maintenance plan or manual. After notification by the owning entity, the planning director and the city engineer shall inspect the completed improvements and shall inform the owning entity of any required additions, changes or modifications and of the time period to complete such improvements. 
(4)	Amendments to the plans and specifications of the storm water control structure and/or the operation and maintenance plan or manual shall be approved by the city council. Proposed changes shall be prepared by a North Carolina registered professional engineer or landscape architect (to the extent that G.S. ch. 89A (G.S. 89A-1 et seq.) allows) and submitted to the planning director and reviewed by the city engineer, who shall prepare a report and recommendation prior to consideration by the city council. If the city council approves the proposed changes, the owning entity of the storm water control structure shall file sealed copies of the revisions with the planning director. 
(5)	If the city council finds that the operation and maintenance plan or manual is inadequate for any reason, the council shall direct the planning director to notify the owning entity of any required changes and shall prepare and file copies of the revised agreement with the county register of deeds and the owning entity. 
(d)	Application and inspection fees . 
(1)	Processing and inspection fees shall be submitted in the form of a check or money order made payable to the City of Newton. Applications shall be returned if not accompanied by the required fee. 
(2)	A permit and inspection fee schedule, as approved by the city council, shall be posted in the office of the planning director. 
(3)	Inspection fees shall be valid for 60 days. An inspection fee shall be required when improvements are made to the storm water control structure consistent with subsection (c) of this section, except in the case when a similar fee has been paid within the last 60 days. 
(e)	Inspections and release of performance bond. 
(1)	The stormwater control structure shall be inspected by the city engineer and the planning director after the owning entity notifies the planning director that all work has been completed. At this inspection, the owning entity shall provide: 
a.	The signed deed, related easements and survey plat for the storm water control structure ready for filing with the county register of deeds; 
b.	A certification sealed by an engineer or landscape architect (to the extent that G.S. ch. 89A (G.S. 89A-1 et seq.) allows) stating that the storm water control structure is complete and consistent with the approved plans and specifications. 
(2)	The planning director shall present the materials submitted by the developer and the inspection report and recommendations to the city council at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
a.

Sec. 102-683. - Appeals. 
    Appeals of administrative decisions and interpretations of this division may be made to the board of adjustment, which is hereby established as the watershed review board, under the procedures described in article II, division 2, of this chapter. Applicants may seek variances only from the low-density regulations of this article under the procedures described in article II, division 2, of this chapter; provided, that the planning director shall mail a copy of the public notice of the variance request by first class mail to all other jurisdictions and entities, using the water supply for consumption within the watershed protection area established for Lake Norman and the Jacob Fork River, 15 days prior to the meeting date. The planning director shall send a preliminary record of the decision to grant a variance to the environmental management commission for its review, as follows: 
(1)	If the commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a variance and that the property owner can secure no reasonable return from, nor make any practical use of, the property unless the propose variance is granted, and the variation, if granted, will not result in a serious threat to the water supply, then the commission shall approve the variance as proposed or approve the proposed variance with conditions and stipulations. The commission shall prepare a commission decision and send it to the board of adjustment. If the commission approves the variance with conditions and stipulations, the board shall prepare a final decision, including such conditions and stipulations, granting the proposed variance. 
(2)	If the commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a variance and that the property owner can secure a reasonable return from, or make a practical use of, the property without the variance, or the variance, if granted, will result in a serious threat to the water supply, then the commission shall deny approval of the variance as proposed. The commission shall prepare a commission decision and send it to the board of adjustment. The board shall prepare a final decision denying the variance as proposed. 
(3)	The city council shall hear all appeals for variances from the high-density option regulations of this article following the variance procedures established by this article and article II, division 2, of this chapter. The decision of the city council may be appealed to the superior court. When the city council finds that a variance from the high-density option regulations is necessary in unique circumstances to accommodate important social and economic development, it shall prepare a record of the appeal, the evidence presented, its deliberations and findings and its proposed decision, including all conditions or modifications it proposes. The city council shall send this record and its variance request to the environmental management commission, which may grant, grant with modifications, or deny the request. The commission shall notify the city council in writing of its decision. If the environmental management commission approves the variance request, any conditions or stipulations it requires shall become part of the high-density permit. Final decisions of the commission may be appealed under the Administrative Procedure Act, G.S. 150B-1 et seq.

Sec. 102-703. - Review of general development plan. 
(a)	The following review process shall apply to all GDP projects in the 321-COD districts: 
(1)	Initial contact with planning director or his designee. 
(2)	Pre-application conference. The conference will be a relatively informal meeting between developers and local government staff from each city department or outside agency as (e.g. planning, public works and utilities director, fire chief, police chief, NCDOT district engineer, NC Division of Environmental Management, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers). As much information as possible (preferably including sketch plans) should be presented to the local government staff by the developer(s). The developer may waive this meeting and submit the application for GDP review. 
(3)	Application filing and staff review. The developer shall submit a GDP. On receipt of the GDP application, site plan, and detailed proposals as indicated herein, the planning director or his designee shall cause a study to be made by the planning department, the city public works and utilities director and such other agencies or officials as appear appropriate in the circumstances of the case, to determine conformity with the adopted land use plan, zoning and other regulations applicable to the case. Staff comments and concerns will be compiled by the planning director or his designee, who, in turn shall assist the developer in making any necessary adjustments to the plans. 
(b)	Following such review, unless complete conformity is found, the applicant shall be notified in writing by the planning director or his designee of discrepancies. The planning director or his designee shall assist the applicant in bringing the material submitted as nearly as possible into conformity with requirements or to define specifically the modification(s) of regulations which seem justified in view of equivalent service of public purposes by the proposal. 
(c)	At such time as further changes appear unnecessary, the planning director or his designee shall review the GDP to ascertain whether the GDP meets the requirements of the 321-COD district. 
(d)	The planning director or his designee shall approve the GDP, conditioned on specific modifications, or disapprove, with recorded reasons therefor. After a GDP has been approved, zoning, watershed and building permits shall be issued in the same manner as for building permits generally, provided that any requirements concerning the order and location in which building permits are to be issued in the particular GDP shall be observed. Except as provided below, approval of final plans and reports shall be binding on the applicants and any successors in title, so long as 321-COD zoning applies to the land. 
(e)	GDP approval is an administrative action. No public notices or hearing is required in connection with approval proceedings on final plans or changes in approved plans. For nonresidential development, close coordination with Catawba County Economic Development Corporation (EDC) will be encouraged. 
(Code 1972, § 26-18.8.12; Ord. No. 99.70, § 1, 10-20-1999) 
Sec. 102-704. - Changes to general development plan. 
    Changes in approved plans may be permitted by the planning director or his designee on application by the original applicant or successors in interest. A revised plan shall be required when the following occurs: 
(1)	Any increase in intensity of use. An increase in intensity of use shall be considered to be an increase in usable floor area, an increase in the number of dwelling or lodging units, or an increase in outside land area devoted to sales, displays or demonstrations. 
(2)	Any change in parking resulting in an increase or reduction of five percent or more in the number of spaces approved. 
(3)	Any reduction in the amount of open spaces, resulting in a decrease of more than five percent or any substantial change in the location or characteristics of open space. 
(4)	Any change in use. 
(5)	Substantial changes in pedestrian or vehicular access or circulation. 
The planning director or his designee shall review the revised GDP to ascertain whether it meets the requirements of the current 321-COD district. 
(Code 1972, § 26-18.8.13; Ord. No. 99.70, § 1, 10-20-1999)

(8)	Driveway permit application. The NCDOT issues driveway permits for new driveway connections to the state highway system. Indication that a driveway permit has been applied for from NCDOT must be submitted. 
(9)	Site access study. A "site access study" (commonly referred to a traffic impact analysis or traffic impact statement) shall be prepared and submitted for the GDP when recommended by the NCDOT district engineer. The site access study may also be prepared by the applicant to refute the necessity of one or more required traffic improvements. This study shall be completed by a professional engineer licensed in the State of North Carolina and familiar with the standard practice of site access analysis. A formal recommendation by the NC district engineer concerning a refuted requirement may be substituted for the study. The site access study will be used to determine and describe how traffic generated by new or altered land uses will be served by the existing relevant road network and what adjustments must be made to maintain the same or similar level of service. The following information must be prepared as part of the site access study: 
a.	Peak hour trip generation for the proposed land use(s). Trip generation rates shall be obtained from the most recent edition of Trip Generation, an Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) publication. 
b.	Trip distribution to attractions and surrounding area. 
c.	Capacity analysis of adjacent intersections and all proposed access points in accordance with the latest Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Capacity Manual. 
d.	Alternative analysis for a number of access points and any alternatives proposed by the developer or the city. 
e.	Recommendations for necessary number and location of access points in accordance with calculated capacity and alternative analysis. 
f.	An appendix which shall include all calculations, technical data, visual diagrams and other applicable information. 
g.	A traffic mitigation plan that suggests alternative improvements aimed at correcting any adverse impacts, or decreases in the levels of service, caused by the new development. 
The existing relevant traffic network includes all of the major and minor thoroughfares and collectors from the point of origin at the proposed development up to and including intersections with secondary roads. The study must show the impact of the proposed development on the level of service of the relevant streets in the traffic network. "Level of service" refers to the categories A through F set forth in the U.S. 321 corridor district plan. The city, with assistance from the Hickory-Newton-Conover Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) and the NCDOT district engineer, will review the site access study for compliance with these requirements. Projected traffic demands and necessary improvements created by a proposed GDP project will be evaluated by the city, the MPO and the NCDOT district engineer. The results of the corresponding impacts shall be evaluated relative to the computed levels of service at various time frames and durations as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual. A plan for mitigating any adverse impacts shall be proposed by the developer and approved by the city prior to the issuance of any building permits. The traffic mitigation plan shall be based on the results of the traffic impact study and shall include proposed improvements, a cost estimate, a construction schedule and the extent of participation by the proposed development. If adequate facilities cannot be provided by the city or NCDOT, the city may require that: (a) the developer of the project provide the necessary improvements to overcome the deficiency, or (b) the development be delayed until the public sector makes the improvements, or (c) the development be stated to coincide with stated improvements to ensure that roadway facilities are available concurrent with development. 
(Code 1972, § 26-18.8.14; Ord. No. 99.70, § 1, 10-20-1999) 
Sec. 102-706. - Site design and improvement standards. 
    The following standards and regulations shall be adhered to for all development and related activities within the 321-COD district: 
(1)	General provisions. The following general provisions shall apply: 
a.	Other regulations. The site design shall conform to all local, state, and federal regulations through the GDP review process. 
b.	Long-range plans. It shall also conform to all long-range plans concerning such issues as road building and utility extensions. 
c.	General site design. In general, the site design shall attempt to reduce cut and fill; protect ground water resources; avoid unnecessary paved surfaces; provide adequate access; promote visual attractiveness, and mitigate adverse impacts of noise, odor, traffic, drainage and utilities on adjacent properties. 
d.	Suitable sites. The site shall be suitable for development in the manner proposed without hazards to persons or property, on or off the site, free from the probability of flooding, erosion, subsidence or slipping of the soil, or other dangers. Conditions of soil, ground water level, drainage and topography shall all be appropriate to both the kind and pattern of use intended. 
e.	Unified site planning. If appropriate to the form of development, lands to be included in 321-COD districts may be divided by streets, alleys, rights-of-way of easements, but shall be so located, dimensioned and arranged as to permit unified planning and development and to meet all requirements in connection therewith, as well as to provide necessary protection against adverse relationships between uses in the district and uses in surrounding areas. 
(2)	Preservation. Protecting environmentally sensitive land and historical sites should be given high priority in site design. More specifically, the following shall be preserved, whenever feasible: 
a.	Wetlands: Wetlands as defined through field inspection by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; 
b.	Floodplains: Lands in the floodplain as identified on Federal Emergency Management Agency flood hazard maps; 
c.	Steep slopes: Slopes in excess of 20 percent over intervals of ten feet or more; 
d.	Historic sites. 
(3)	Dimensional requirements. The following dimensional requirements shall be adhered to: 
a.	Permitted building height. Buildings up to 75 feet shall be allowed in the 321-COD district subject to the setback requirements set forth herein. Additional building heights shall be allowed subject to an increase in building setbacks of one foot for each additional one foot in building height. 
b.	Building setbacks. The minimum building setback (required yard) from the edge of all street rights-of-way, planned street rights-of-way and property lines for the outer boundaries of the development shall be as follows: 
Setback From Minimum Setback U.S. 321 Freeway right-of-way 100 feet Major and minor thoroughfare rights-of-way  75 feet All other road rights-of-way (public or private)  50 feet Nonresidential property lines  50 feet Residential property lines  75 feet  
c.	General subdivision lot requirements. In subdivisions approved through the GDP process, design of interior individual lots shall adhere to the following dimensional requirements (except for requirements included in site design and improvement standards, mixed use development provisions 321-ED(MX) district only, residential provisions and nonresidential provisions). 
Minimum Sizes     Lot Yard Use Elements Overall Width Front Side Rear 321-ED(MX) 20,000 sq. ft. 100' 30' 20' 30' 321-ED(I) 40,000 sq. ft. 100' 30' 25' 35'  
d.	Street line preservation. Where a major and minor thoroughfare is planned to be built or widened and initial roadway design and right-of-way locations have been completed, all building setbacks shall account for these improvements. In cases where a future road or road improvements is shown on the Catawba County Thoroughfare Plan or the Hickory-Newton-Conover Urban area Thoroughfare Plan, the developer is to take possible road improvements into account in the site design. 
e.	Nonresidential densities. To encourage land assemblage, floor area ratios (FAR) shall be permitted on a sliding scale as follows: 
Project Size Maximum FAR 5.00-24.99 acres 0.30 25-49.99 acres 0.40 50.00-99.99 acres 0.50 100.00 acres or more 0.60  
(Code 1972, § 26-18.8.15; Ord. No. 99.70, § 1, 10-20-1999) 
Sec. 102-707. - Circulation system design. 
    The following circulation system requirements shall apply to all development in the 321-COD district: 
(1)	General provisions. 321-COD districts shall be so located with respect to expressways, arterial and collector streets, and shall be so designed as to provide direct access to and from such districts without creating traffic along minor streets in residential neighborhoods outside the district. 
(2)	Access to major roads. All GDP's shall have access to at least one major or minor thoroughfare unless it is less than the minimum parcel size requirement as noted in section 102-700, GDP requirement, subsection (2), Minimum parcel size, subsection a. 
(3)	Access points permitted. One access point shall be allowed on any property with less than 400 feet of frontage on a major or minor thoroughfare. Two access points shall be allowed on a major and minor thoroughfare if the property has frontage that equals or exceeds 400 feet on a major or minor thoroughfare and the results of a site access study or a recommendation from the NCDOT indicates the need for a second access point. Three access points shall be allowed if the property has a frontage that equals or exceeds 800 feet on a major or minor thoroughfare and the results of a site access study or a recommendation from the NCDOT indicates the need for a third access point. Three access points shall be the maximum number of access points allowed for a single project on any major or minor thoroughfare. 
(4)	Location of access points. The location of access points shall be in conformance with NCDOT's policies for street and driveway connections. 
(5)	Off-site traffic improvements. Transition tapers and deceleration lanes shall be required for all GDP projects where a site access study requires or a recommendation from the NCDOT indicates that such improvements are necessary. The costs of deceleration lanes and transition tapers shall be the responsibility of the owner or developer of the property. 
(6)	Shared access. Mutual shared access agreements shall be required between adjacent property owners with frontage on major or minor thoroughfares when site plans are submitted concurrently. When access is to be shared, easements, liability arrangements and a maintenance agreement must be submitted to and approved by the city attorney prior to occupancy. Where no mutual shared access is feasible due to topographical or other physical constraints, access shall be in conformance with NCDOT's policies for street and driveway connections. 
(7)	Connected interior driveways/parking. Adjacent commercial developments with access to a major or minor thoroughfare shall connect interior parking and driveways. Where adjacent commercial property is vacant, sufficient provisions to connect to the properties shall be submitted. Parcels with frontage on major or minor thoroughfares shall also be required to provide (or reserve) sufficient access to any adjacent properties with poor or nonexistent access. (See subsection (6) of this section, Shared access). When a GDP is submitted for a tract that is located immediately adjacent to properties less than five acres that front along a common public street, the plan shall include the provision of reasonable access to the adjacent properties by one of the following ways: 
a.	Building layout shall be shown with a break or open space to allow for construction of a future road serving the adjoining property. The plans shall locate such future road site at a location where, according to sound engineering practices, actual construction of the road would be practical. 
b.	The internal road circulation pattern on the site plan shall show a roadway that will be constructed as part of the GDP which connects to the adjoining property. 
(8)	Channelization. Channelization (the separation of conflicting traffic movements into well-defined paths of travel by traffic islands or significant pavement markings) improvements shall be considered where a site access study indicates the possible existence of significant turning conflicts involved with the new development. 
(9)	Signalization. Only after all other traffic improvements have been explored shall signalizations be installed. Traffic signals will reduce turning conflicts but may significantly disrupt traffic flow. 
(10)	Street design. All streets shall be designed and paved to meet NCDOT standards. 
(Code 1972, § 26-18.8.16; Ord. No. 99.70, § 1, 10-20-1999) 
Sec. 102-708. - Landscaping, buffering and screening. 
    The following landscaping requirements shall apply to all development in the 321-COD district: 
(1)	Construction cleanup. All dead or dying trees, stumps, litter, brush, weeds or other debris shall be removed from the site at the time of occupancy. 
(2)	Maintenance. All landscaping and screening shall be maintained so as to continue their effectiveness. 
(3)	Landscaping of disturbed land. Landscaping of all cuts and fills shall be sufficient to prevent erosion. All roadway slopes shall also be landscaped. 
(4)	Interior street landscaping. For multitenant, multiparcel, or multibuilding developments, shade trees shall be planted along both sides of all interior access streets (excluding streets not typically used by the public). Typical plantings must include as a minimum 14 shade trees per 1,000 linear feet which are at least eight feet tall at planting and will be 20 feet tall at maturation are similar in size and shape. 
(5)	Entranceway. Multitenant, multiparcel or multibuilding developments must provide for the installation of a median-type entranceway at all entrances on major or minor thoroughfares. The median shall be grassed and landscaped. 
(6)	Use of existing topography. Developments shall utilize existing topography such as hills, ridges, and berms to screen parking and maintenance areas to the maximum extent possible. 
(7)	Highway 321 buffer. A 50-foot "landscaped buffer area" shall be required for the portion of all development adjacent to the U.S. 321 right-of-way. 
a.	The buffer shall include the following improvements: 
1.	One tree (eight feet tall in three years) per 50 linear feet of frontage; and 
2.	One tree (smaller ornamental tree) per 50 linear feet of frontage; and 
3.	One shrub or similar planting per 15 linear feet of frontage. 
b.	The remaining area shall include a ground cover of seeded grass, sod or rock, brick, or wood mulch or any combination of these items. 
c.	The developer may substitute existing vegetation for some or all of these requirements when practical. Buildings or parking areas shall be prohibited in the buffer areas. The buffer shall extend along the entire length of the lot. 
(8)	Residential buffers. When a 321-COD district directly abuts a residential zoning district, all of the structures for the nonresidential uses shall be set back 75 feet from the residential property line(s). This area shall be labeled as the "natural buffer area." No buildings, signs or parking are allowed in this area. The buffer must include a row of evergreen trees placed not more than five feet apart which would form a continuous hedge of at least eight feet tall at planting. Low-growing evergreen shrubs shall fill in all gaps between the trees. Opaque fencing (six feet tall) or existing topography may be used in lieu of vegetative screening for all or part of the natural buffer area if the same or better screening will result. The intent of this requirement is to heavily screen the development from the residential district. 
(9)	Water body buffers. An undisturbed natural buffer shall be provided along all rivers, streams, creeks and other natural bodies of water which: (a) are identified as perennial waters on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) quadrangle topographic maps; and (b) qualify as environmentally sensitive areas (i.e., floodplains as delineated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and wetlands, as identified by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers through field inspection). Where such resources are present, no design shall be approved unless it complies with the requirements of applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations pertaining to these resources. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, section 404 of the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations, article XIII of this chapter. Existing undesirable vegetation may be cleared and the buffer revegetated or landscaped within a reasonable time period to minimize sedimentation and erosion. Manmade bodies of water such as retention ponds or aesthetic eater attractions are not subject to this requirement. These areas may be used to calculate required open space as provided herein. 
(10)	Parking area landscaping. Where parking facilities are located in the front of the development, the following landscaping standards are required. 
a.	The standard for all parking areas shall be one shade tree (at least four feet tall at planting and eight feet within three years) per 2,000 square feet of space dedicated as parking. The trees shall be evenly spaced throughout the parking area. Five percent of the parking areas shall be landscaped with plantings (bushes, shrubs, flower beds). The perimeter landscaping standards shall not be combined with the parking area requirements. No more than 15 spaces may be in a continuous row without being interrupted by landscaping and at least one shade tree. 
b.	A landscape buffer area, 35 feet wide, shall be required along all roads which shall include as a minimum one of the following: 
One tree (eight feet tall in three years) per 50 linear feet of frontage; and 
One tree (smaller ornamental tree) per 50 feet of linear feet of frontage; and 
One shrub or similar planting per 15 linear feet of frontage. The remaining area shall include a ground cover of seeded grass, sod, or rock, brick, or wood mulch or any combination of these items. 
or 
A continuous row of shrubbery, a landscaped, stabilized earthen berm of at least four feet above parking lot grade level or a wall. Attention shall be given to ensure that traffic safety measures are adhered to (including site distance triangles). 
It is the intention of this requirement to create a more pedestrian-friendly environment, reduce urban heat, reduce wind and air turbulence, reduce noise, reduce the glare of automobile lights, reduce stormwater drainage problems and protect and preserve the appearance, character and value of adjacent properties. It is not the intention of this requirement to decrease visibility or to unreasonably screen buildings or signs. No interior buffers are required between individual parcels or buildings in multiparcel or multitenant developments such as shopping centers and industrial/office parks. This requirement is intended to provide a natural edge to an increasingly urban environment. If significant existing topography or other natural barriers provide a sufficient natural edge, the landscaped buffer areas may be waived. 
(11)	Maintenance area screening. All loading, shipping, storage, maintenance, trash/refuse and mechanical areas shall be heavily landscaped with mature trees (at least six feet tall) or other screening (also six feet tall) while providing sufficient space for ingress and egress of vehicles. Mechanical areas on the tops of buildings shall be screened. 
(12)	Entrance landscaping. Landscaping shall be provided at site entrances, in public recreation/open space areas and adjacent to buildings. The type and amount of landscaping required shall be allowed to vary with the type of development 
(Code 1972, § 26-18.8.17; Ord. No. 99.70, § 1, 10-20-1999) 
Sec. 102-709. - Pedestrian design. 
    The following pedestrian design requirements shall apply to all development in the 321-COD district: 
(1)	General provisions. In general, the plan shall provide a unified and well-organized arrangement of buildings, service areas, parking, pedestrian and landscaped common areas providing for maximum comfort and convenience of visitors and employees. Commercial buildings shall be so grouped in relation to parking areas that, after visitors arriving by automobile enter the walkway system, establishments can be visited conveniently with a minimum of conflicts with vehicles. 
(2)	Pedestrian design. For multitenant/building/parcel projects, the site plan shall include provisions for pedestrian-scale amenities which may include benches, picnic tables, courtyards, plazas, water attractions and trash receptacles. These enhancements are essential to creating an efficient and functional environment as well as promoting a "sense of place." An area shall be reserved for pedestrian use and/or open space, and shall be improved and maintained accordingly. Such areas may include covered malls for general pedestrian use, exterior walkways, outdoor seating areas and the like where the facilities are available for common use by employees and visitors. Required buffer areas and setback yards as well as improved deck and roof areas may be used to meet this requirement. 
(3)	Heavy traffic generators. Service stations, fast food restaurants and similar uses, if provided, shall be so located that operations do not interrupt pedestrian or traffic flows in other parts of the development. 
(4)	Location of loading zones and maintenance areas. Loading zones where customers pick up goods shall be so located and arranged as to prevent interference with pedestrian movement within the development. Facilities and access routes for shopping center deliveries, servicing, and maintenance shall be so located and arranged as to prevent interference with pedestrian traffic in the center. 
(5)	Pedestrian travel. All buildings or building clusters within the development shall be connected with linkages other than roads (sidewalks, bikeways and walking paths). When feasible, these linkages shall be provided between adjacent sites. Pedestrian access may be provided at any suitable locations within the district, but shall, where practicable, be separated from vehicular access points in order to reduce congestion, marginal friction and hazards, except where signalization is used in such a manner as to control pedestrian and vehicular movements safely. 
(6)	Natural areas. Protecting environmentally sensitive areas for use as open space in the development should be given a high priority in site design. The GDP shall identify these environmentally sensitive areas (i.e., floodplains as delineated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and wetlands, as identified by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers through field inspection). Where such resources are present, no design shall be approved unless it complies with the requirements of all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to these resources. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, section 404 of the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations, article XIII of this chapter. 
(Code 1972, § 26-18.8.18; Ord. No. 99.70, § 1, 10-20-1999) 
Sec. 102-710. - Parking. 
    The following requirements shall apply to all parking in the 321-COD district: 
(1)	General provisions. Off-street parking shall be provided as required by article IX of this chapter. Off-street loading shall be provided with area location and design appropriate to the needs of occupants of the district and protection of adjacent property from adverse effects. No space designated as required off-street parking space for the general public shall be used as off-street loading space or maneuvering room for vehicles being loaded or unloaded. 
(2)	Interior parking encouraged. Parking lots shall be kept separate and shall be located in the interior sections of multiple building developments when possible. In single building developments, parking areas shall be located in the rear of the site when practical. If parking must be located in the front of buildings, the parking area landscaping requirements listed in section 102-708(10), Landscaping, buffering and screening, parking area landscaping, shall apply. 
(3)	Parking setbacks. Where parking is located in the front, all parking areas shall be located behind the landscaped buffer areas and set back a minimum of five feet from all buildings. This separation shall be grassed and landscaped and may include sidewalks. 
(4)	Connected parking areas. All parking areas should be lined to parking on adjacent project sites. When adjacent property is zoned 321-COD, provisions shall be made to allow for this parking connection when the property develops. 
(Code 1972, § 26-18.8.19; Ord. No. 99.70, § 1, 10-20-1999) 
Sec. 102-711. - Signs. 
    The following requirements shall apply to all signage in the 321-COD district: 
(1)	General provisions. All signs for the GDP project shall conform to the requirements in article VII of this chapter except where the requirements included herein are more restrictive. Additionally, the following general provisions shall apply:

Sec. 102-713. - Mixed use development provisions (321-ED(MX) district only). 
(a)	Intent. The mixed use development concept intends to: 
(1)	Permit a flexible mixture of various residential development types which may include certain commercial/office/civic establishments primarily serving the residents living in the development. 
(2)	Encourage commercial and office uses that do not attract large volumes of traffic and continuous consumer turnover. 
(3)	Provide for an alternative to strip-style, highway-oriented commercial uses. 
(4)	Permit uses that promote the construction of new buildings (and the conversion of existing buildings) that maintain the visual character and architectural scale of other uses in the same project. 
(5)	Minimize the visual and functional conflicts between residential and nonresidential uses within and surrounding the development. 
(6)	Create relatively self-contained residential neighborhoods that provide many services on-site that would otherwise require frequent automobile use. 
(b)	Permitted uses. The following uses shall be permitted in mixed use developments provided that the use "compatibility criteria" (below) are adhered to for each proposed use: 
(1)	Residential uses including multifamily (including townhouses), duplexes, zero-lot-line single-family homes, and typical large lot single-family detached homes. 
(2)	Retail specialty shops including the sale of gifts, antiques, flowers, books, jewelry, wearing apparel, craft shops and other similar uses. 
(3)	Personal service shops including tailors, beauty salons, barbers, shoe repair, dressmaking and other similar uses. 
(4)	Business offices including financial services (excluding drive in windows), real estate sales, travel agencies, insurance sales, advertising, mailing services and other similar uses. 
(5)	Studios for dance, art, music, photography or similar uses. 
(6)	Professional offices for doctors, lawyers, dentists, chiropractors, engineers, architects, and other similar uses. 
(7)	Mixed-uses structures containing one or more dwelling units and other nonresidential uses permitted herein. 
(8)	Government buildings or structures necessary to serve the residents of the development, including but not limited to, schools, libraries, post offices, and utility maintenance buildings. 
(9)	Accessory buildings and uses. 
(c)	Use compatibility criteria. The uses listed in "permitted uses" (above) must adhere to all of the following compatibility criteria to be permitted: 
(1)	There is a clear relationship between nonresidential and residential uses on any one site or adjacent sites. 
(2)	The use will not attract large volumes of vehicular traffic nor require more than one access point. 
(3)	Minimum visual and functional conflict will be created between the proposed uses or nearby uses. 
(4)	Anticipated noise and congestion created by the use will be insignificant, especially in the evenings. 
(5)	The bulk, height and scale of the building(s) will be compatible with surrounding (or proposed) residential development. 
(Code 1972, § 26-18.8.22; Ord. No. 99.70, § 1, 10-20-1999) 
Sec. 102-714. - Additional mixed use development standards. 
    In addition to the applicable 321-COD district requirements listed herein, all mixed use developments must conform to the following standards: 
(1)	Project design. Without limiting the inventiveness and creativity of the developer, the following general design guidelines shall be adhered to: 
a.	All building sites and/or buildings shall be accessed on interior streets, not on thoroughfares or arterials or collectors. 
b.	The placement of all buildings shall take into consideration topography, privacy, building height, orientation, drainage and aesthetics. 
c.	The commercial development on the site shall preferably be located at the development entrance ways at major or minor thoroughfares unless significantly reliant on pedestrian customers. Higher density residential development shall be located along major interior roads between or at intersections. 
d.	Common, accessible open space shall be required for all mixed use developments. The open space shall be pedestrian-oriented and include such amenities as park benches, walking trails and gazebos. Parking or vehicular access within these areas shall be prohibited. The open space must comprise at least 20 percent of the gross project area and may be more when the reduced lot sizes are used or transfer of development rights are granted. 
e.	The site shall be divided into "clusters" or "mini-neighborhoods" that separate the different development types. This must be done while maintaining the interconnectivity and accessibility of all uses. The number of units per cluster shall be between four and 20. The use of curving cul-de-sacs off interior collector roads is recommended to achieve the clusters. 
f.	There must be one central "focus area" to the project. The focus may be a recreation or common open space area (playground, tennis courts, golf course), an entertainment facility (clubhouse, meeting facility, amphitheater) or a pedestrian-oriented commercial area needing little or no parking. 
g.	There shall be several small "pocket parks" that serve as convenient passive open space and/or recreation areas for those directly adjacent residents. 
h.	Sidewalks, five feet wide, shall be included with all interior access street and parking area designs. Sidewalks may be constructed at the time of development or may be phased in over a period of several years as demand warrants. If the sidewalks are to be phased in over time, the developer must make payments to a fund that would pay for the sidewalks over time. This payment arrangement must be satisfactory to the planning director or his designee. All sidewalks between residential, open space and commercial sections shall be safe and lead to store fronts, not service areas. 
i.	Minimum lot size: 20,000 square feet. However, lots may be reduced by up to 50 percent of the minimum required lot size provided that at least 75 percent of the balance of the original lot size must be preserved as common open space, accessible by all reduced building sites. 
j.	Minimum lot width: 50 feet (60 feet for duplexes); add ten feet on corner lots. 
k.	Minimum front yard: 15 feet (25 feet where the lot abuts a dedicated street or a large-lot-single-family home site). 
l.	Minimum side yards: Ten feet. 
m.	Minimum rear yards: 20 feet. 
n.	Maximum height: 35 feet or 21/2 stories. 
o.	Accessory buildings shall be located in the rear yard no closer than five feet from the principal dwelling or five feet from any property line and no more than ten feet in height. 
(2)	Reserved. 
(Code 1972, § 26-18.8.23; Ord. No. 99.70, § 1, 10-20-1999) 
Sec. 102-715. - Zero lot line development. 
    Zero lot line development allows the construction of single-family dwellings on individual recorded lots without side yard requirement on one side. This concept permits the better use of the entire lot by compacting the front, rear, and side yards into one or more internal gardens which may be completely walled or screened. This type of development is an affordable alternative to standard large lot single-family dwelling units and apartments, condominiums or townhouses which usually share common walls. 
(1)	Minimum lot size: 20,000 square feet. However, lots may be reduced by up to 75 percent of the minimum required lot size provided that at least 75 percent of the balance of the original lot size must be preserved as common open space, accessible by all reduced building sites. Up to 50 percent of the common open space may be located in a designated floodplain or may be reserved for a public use (school, library, community building, etc.). 
(2)	Minimum lot width: 40 feet (50 feet on corner lots). 
(3)	Minimum front yard: Ten feet (25 feet where the lot abuts a dedicated street or a large lot single-family home site). 
(4)	Minimum side yards: Ten feet on one side, zero feet on the opposite. However, in no case shall a zero lot line dwelling be closer than ten feet to the lot line of a large lot single-family home site or a dedicated street). 
(5)	Minimum rear yards: 20 feet. 
(6)	Maximum height: 35 feet or 21/2 stories. 
(7)	Dwellings shall be constructed against one side lot line and no windows, doors or other openings shall be permitted on this side. The developer must provide for an unobstructed wall maintenance easement of five feet on the adjacent property. 
(8)	Accessory buildings shall be located in rear yard no closer than five feet from the principal dwelling or five feet from any property line and no more than ten feet in height. 
(Code 1972, § 26-18.8.24; Ord. No. 99.70, § 1, 10-20-1999) 
Sec. 102-716. - Multifamily projects. 
    To encourage land assemblage, densities for all multifamily projects shall be administered on the sliding scale as follows. These provisions are based on the acreage of the project. 
Project Acreage Allocated for Residential Use Dwelling Units per Acre 5 Not permitted 5-9.99 10 10-14.99 12 15-19.99 14 20> 16  
(1)	In no case shall there be more than four multifamily units in one linear designed building. Where the design is nonlinear, the planning director or his designee shall determine the number of attached units that are appropriate. 
(2)	Minimum front yard: 15 feet (25 feet where the lot abuts a dedicated street or a large lot single-family home site). 
(3)	Minimum side yards: Ten feet. 
(4)	Minimum rear yards: 20 feet. 
(5)	Maximum height: 35 feet or 21/2 stories. 
(6)	Minimum front yard: Ten feet (25 feet where the lot abuts a dedicated street or a large lot single-family home site). 
(Code 1972, § 26-18.8.25; Ord. No. 99.70, § 1, 10-20-1999) 
Sec. 102-717. - Nonresidential uses. 
    The permitted commercial uses listed in "permitted uses" above are allowed in the general development plan zoning district through the GDP review process. These uses shall comply with the following standards: 
(1)	The permitted uses listed above in "permitted uses" must comply with the "use compatibility criteria" also listed above. 
(2)	The following site design and dimensional standards shall apply for all nonresidential components of a mixed use development. 
a.	Minimum lot size: 10,000 square feet. 
b.	Minimum lot width: 50 feet (60 feet for duplexes); add ten feet on corner lots. 
c.	Maximum height: 35 feet or 21/2 stories. 
d.	Accessory buildings shall be located in rear yard no closer than five feet from the principal dwelling or five feet from any property line and no more than ten feet in height. 
(Code 1972, § 26-18.8.26; Ord. No. 99.70, § 1, 10-20-1999) 
Sec. 102-718. - Parking requirements. 
    The following parking requirements shall apply to multifamily and nonresidential components of all mixed use developments: 
(1)	The minimum number of off-street parking spaces shall comply with the requirements of the off-street parking and loading requirements of article IX of this chapter. 
(2)	The parking area locational criteria and design and standards of "landscaping, buffering and screening" and "parking" herein shall be adhered to for all mixed use developments. 
(3)	On-street parking (provided by the developer) may be allocated by the planning director or his designee as a portion of the required on-site parking requirements until the allocation of these spaces is completed. To be allocated, the parking space may be no further than 200 feet from the establishment's main entrance.

DIVISION 5. - SAINT PAULS OVERLAY DISTRICT 

Sec. 102-721. - Saint Pauls Overlay District-Intent. 
    The State of North Carolina General Statutes permit municipalities to establish zoning overlay districts. Within the zoning overlay district, additional requirements may be imposed over the underlying general use and special use zoning districts. The city recognizes, through an extensive community discussion process, that general use and special use zoning districts alone cannot accomplish the goals of the community. It has been determined by city council that zoning overlay districts offer the opportunity towards accomplishing the policies of the Saint Pauls Small Area Plan adopted May 9th, 2002. 
    The zoning overlay district standards require a basic level of site and structural design. The standards are not intended to limit creativity nor create a community where everything looks the same. The intent is to serve as a tool for design in the context of developing the Saint Pauls Area as a unique place while maintaining its sense of place. Consideration is given to balancing the interests of property owners with the betterment of the community's safety, welfare, well being, and aesthetic character. 
(Ord. No. 2008-20, § 1, 8-5-2008) 
Sec. 102-722. - Same-Boundaries. 
    The boundaries of the Saint Pauls Overlay District (SPI-7) are as shown on the official zoning atlas and are designated as follows: 
Saint Pauls Overlay District (SPI-7) 
(Ord. No. 2008-20, § 1, 8-5-2008) 
Sec. 102-723. - Same-Applicability. 
    Persons, partnerships, corporations, and other legal entities wishing to develop property of any size, type, or density within the Saint Pauls Small Area Plan Overlay District (SPI-7) district shall comply with the following standards in addition to the applicable zoning ordinance requirements. More specifically, no building or structure shall be erected or altered for any purpose except in accordance with the requirements herein. 
    New and existing single-family, site-built or manufactured homes are exempt from the requirements of the SPI-7 district as long as the property is being used for residential purposes. 
    Existing non-residential or multifamily uses are exempt from the provision of the SPI-7 district; however, they shall be subject to the requirements of the SPI-7 District as they expand the physical structure of the building or facility to extent practical as determined by the planning director. 
    The SPI-7 district regulations which follow shall apply generally to the development of land through the review process contained herein. Where there are conflicts between the special regulations herein and general zoning, subdivision, or other regulations or requirements, the more restrictive requirement shall apply in spi-7 districts, unless the planning director or his designee or his designee finds, in the particular case, that the provisions herein do not serve public purposes to a degree at least equivalent to such general zoning, subdivision, or other regulations or requirements. 
    Where actions, designs, or solutions proposed by the applicant are not literally in accord with applicable SPI-7 regulations or general regulations, but the planning director or his designee makes a finding in the particular case, that public purposes are satisfied to an equivalent or greater degree, the planning director or his designee may make specific modification of the regulations in the particular case. 
    Except as indicated above, notwithstanding procedures and requirements generally in effect, procedures and requirements set forth herein shall apply in SPI-7 districts, to any amendments creating such districts, and to issuance of all required permits therein. 
(Ord. No. 2008-20, § 1, 8-5-2008) 
Sec. 102-724. - Same-Uses. 
    Permitted uses: The uses allowed within the Saint Pauls Overlay District are those uses that are identified as permitted and permissible special uses in the underlying zoning districts in table 4-1 as well as those listed as such in article IV with the exception of the uses that are specifically identified by this section as prohibited uses.

Sec. 102-725. - Same-Site plan required. 
    Any person wishing to develop or redevelop a lot or parcel shall submit a site plan. A separate zoning site plan shall be submitted showing applicable ordinance requirements. An architectural plan shall also be submitted indicating compliance with the applicable building design and site standards. 
(Ord. No. 2008-20, § 1, 8-5-2008) 
Sec. 102-726. - Same-Site standards. 
    The standards and regulations in this section should be adhered to for all development in the SPI-7 District: 
(1)	General provisions: 
a.	Plan compliance. It shall conform to all long-range plans concerning such issues as thoroughfares, utility extensions and land-use. 
b.	General site design. In general, the site design shall attempt to reduce cut and fill; protect groundwater resources; avoid unnecessary paved surfaces; provide adequate access and promote visual attractiveness. 
c.	Suitable sites. The site shall be suitable for development in the manner proposed without hazards to persons or property, on or off the site, free from the probability of flooding, erosion, subsidence or slipping of the soil, or other dangers. Conditions of soil, groundwater level, drainage and topography shall all be appropriate to both the kind and pattern of use intended. 
d.	Unified site planning. If appropriate to the form of development, lands included in the SPI-7 may be divided by streets, alleys, rights-of-way or easements, but shall be so located, dimensioned and arranged as to permit unified planning and development and to meet all requirements in connection therewith, as well as to provide necessary protection against adverse relationships between uses in the district and uses in surrounding areas. 
(2)	Preservation. Protecting environmentally sensitive land, open space and historical sites should be given high priority in site design. More specifically the following shall be preserved whenever feasible: 
a.	Wetlands. Wetlands as defined through field inspection by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
b.	Floodplains. Lands in the floodplain as identified on Federal Emergency Management Agency flood hazard maps. 
c.	Historic sites. Sites that are designated by a federal, state, county, or city government or agency to be historical in nature and worthy of protection. 
(Ord. No. 2008-20, § 1, 8-5-2008) 
Sec. 102-727. - Same-Commercial, office and institutional building design standards/site standards. 
(a)	Building size. Individual buildings are limited to a 50,000-square feet footprint. If a proposed building exceeds 50,000-square feet footprint, the development must have direct access to a main arterial. 
(b)	Street line preservation. Where a major and minor thoroughfare is planned to be built or widened and initial roadway design and right-of-way locations have been completed, all building setbacks shall be measured from the expanded right-of-way for these improvements. Future roads or road improvements that are shown on the Greater Hickory MPO Transportation Plan or City Small Area Plan shall be indicated on any subdivision plat, site plan, or zoning compliance permit applications. Buildings and structures shall be located outside the proposed right of way or pavement edge of such improvements where these locations are indicated on the Greater Hickory MPO Thoroughfares Plan or City Small Area Plan. 
(c)	Type of construction. Manufactured or mobile units shall be prohibited except as may be allowed for temporary office management or storage uses during the construction phase. 
(d)	Roof pitch. Roof pitches less than 3/12 and flat roofs will require a parapet wall. A pitched roof shall be profiled by eaves a minimum of 12 inches from the building face or with a gutter. 
(e)	Facade treatment. Architectural elements like windows and doors, bulkheads, masonry piers, transoms, cornice lines, window hoods, awnings, canopies, and other similar details shall be used on all facades facing public or private street rights-of-way. Building wall offsets, including projections, recesses, and changes in floor level shall be used in order to: add architectural interest and variety; relieve the visual effect of a single, long wall; and subdivide the wall into human size proportions. Similarly, roofline offsets should be provided to lend architectural interest and variety to the massing of a building and to relieve the effect of a single, long roof. In order to offer pedestrian interest along sidewalks and paths, the ground level of any building must include windows, entrances, architectural details and awnings. To encourage a pedestrian-friendly environment, buildings must have windows comprising not less than 30 percent of the wall area facing the public right-of-way. Building facades shall be separated at least every 400-feet by either a street or pedestrian amenity. 
(f)	Building entrances. 
(1)	The main customer entrance for a building shall face public or private streets. 
(2)	All sides of a principal building that directly face an abutting public street shall include at least one customer entrance. 
(3)	Customer entrances shall include at least three of the following: (i) canopies or porticos; (ii) roof overhangs; (iii) recesses/projections; (iv) arcades; (v) raised corniced parapets over the door; (vi) peaked roof forms; (vii) arches; (viii) outdoor patios; (ix) display windows; (x) architectural details such as tile work and moldings which are integrated into the building structure and design; or (xi) integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas and/or places for sitting. 
(4)	Service entrances for shipping and receiving shall not be visible from a public street. 
(g)	Street walls. The first floors of all buildings shall be designed to encourage and complement pedestrian-style interest and activity by limiting blank walls to no more than 20 feet in length. A "blank wall" is a facade that does not contain transparent windows or doors. Ventilation grates or emergency exit doors located at the first floor level in the building facade, which are oriented to any public street, shall be decorative. 
(h)	Site appearance. The site design and overall appearance should achieve proportionality and connectivity with adjacent sites to the extent possible while recognizing that individual businesses and uses developed within the corridor are separate and have unique characteristics.

(Ord. No. 2008-20, § 1, 8-5-2008) 
Sec. 102-730. - Same-Driveway connection/access management. 
(a)	Number of driveways permitted. A maximum of one driveway opening shall be permitted to a particular nonresidential development site or to residential projects with the potential of 50 units or more from each one of the abutting streets. Sites which either are occupied by a single-family dwelling or are proposed to be occupied by a single-family dwelling shall be exempt from this subsection. 
When, in the opinion of the city or NCDOT engineer, it is in the interests of good traffic operation, the planning director may permit one additional driveway entrance along a continuous site with frontage in excess of 300 feet or two additional driveway entrances along a continuous site with frontage in excess of 600 feet. Where a dual-service driveway is used, it will be considered, for purposes of this section, to be only one direct-access driveway. In the case of dual one-way driveways, one pair may be used per 250 feet of frontage. Only one pair of one-way drives may be used per street frontage. 
(b)	Driveway spacing. Sites which either are occupied by a single-family dwelling or are proposed to be occupied by a single-family dwelling shall be exempt from this subsection. 
Highway speed 
Limit (MPH) Minimum spacing (feet) 35 150 45 230 50+ 275  
These spacings are based on average vehicle acceleration and deceleration rates and are considered necessary to maintain safe traffic operation. Spacing will be measured from the midpoint of each driveway. In the event that a particular parcel or parcels lack sufficient arterial frontage to maintain adequate spacing, the landowner(s) have one of two options: 
The developer of the project can seek a variance from the board of adjustment for minimum spacing, but in no case can the variance be greater than the next lowest classification on the table above. For example, on a 35 mph arterial requiring 150-foot spacing, the distance may not be reduced. 
The adjacent landowners may agree to establish a common driveway. In such cases, the driveway midpoint should be the property line between the two parcels. The driveway must meet standard specifications, and the estimated driveway volume will be the sum of the trip-generation rate of both land uses in question. 
(c)	Coordination of access. Provisions for circulation between adjacent parcels shall be provided through coordinated or joint parking areas whenever and wherever practicable as approved by the city engineer and NCDOT. Driveway placement should be such that loading and unloading activities will in no way hinder vehicle ingress and egress. Sites which are occupied by a single-family dwelling or are proposed to be occupied by a single-family dwelling shall be exempt from this subsection. 
(d)	Turn lanes and tapers. When required by the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), left turn lanes and acceleration and deceleration lane tapers shall be provided for residential and nonresidential development. Required turn lanes and tapers shall be provided in accordance with NCDOT standards and approved by the NCDOT.
