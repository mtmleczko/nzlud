   WHEREAS, Council has had the matter of codification and general revision of
the legislation of the City before it for some time, and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with The Justinian
Publishing Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such legislation, together with the new matter

before the Council.
   NOW THEREFORE, THE MUNICIPALITY OF CENTERVILLE HEREBY ORDAINS:
   SECTION 1.  That the ordinances and resolutions of the City of Centerville,
Ohio, of a general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, arranged and

except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the 1994 Centerville Municipal Code shall not be
construed to affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any
legislative provision prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an
action or proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability.  Such
enactment shall not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an
act committed in violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an
indictment or prosecution therefor.  For such purposes, any such legislative
provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the
purpose of revision and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
         (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement

Code without an ordinance or resolution history, or with the words "Adopting
Ordinance" at the end thereof, are or contain new matter in the Centerville
Municipal Code, said new matter having been found to be necessary, in the

ARTICLE IV
THE COUNCIL
SECTION 4.01.   POWERS; NUMBER; SELECTION; AND TERM.
   Except as limited or directed by this Charter, all powers of the
Municipality not inconsistent with this Charter shall be vested in a Council

SECTION 4.03.   MAYOR AND DEPUTY-MAYOR.

provided, the Mayor, when present, shall preside at meetings of the Council,
shall be recognized as head of the Municipal Government for all ceremonial and
non-administrative purposes, by the Governor for purposes of military law, and
by the Courts for civil process involving the Municipality.  The Mayor shall

Mayor shall perform all other duties prescribed for the office by ordinance or
by resolution of the Council not inconsistent with the provisions of this
Charter.

following its election, and every two (2) years thereafter, choose, by a
majority vote of all members of the Council, one (1) of its members a Deputy-

a vacancy occurs, the Deputy-Mayor shall serve as Mayor until the next regular

unexpired term, if any; if not, for a full term.  Upon the election of a Mayor,
other than the Deputy-Mayor then serving as Mayor, the Deputy-Mayor may retain
a position as Councilmember for the remainder of his or her unexpired term. In
the event of a vacancy in the office of Mayor whereby the Deputy Mayor is
required to serve as Mayor, the Council shall select a person to fill the

Municipal employment during the term for which said Councilmember or Mayor was
elected or appointed to the Council, and no former Councilmember or Mayor shall
hold any compensated appointive Municipal office or Municipal employment until
two (2) years after the expiration of the term for which he or she was elected
or appointed, except as provided in Section
4.05 (d).
   (b)   Appointment and Removals.  Neither the Council nor any of its members,
including the Mayor, shall in any manner dictate the appointment or removal of
any Municipal officers or employees whom the Manager or any subordinates are
empowered to appoint or remove, but the Council as a body meeting with the
Manager may express its views, and fully and freely discuss with the Manager
anything pertaining to appointment and removal of such officers and employees.
   (c)   Interference With Administration.  Except for the purpose of inquiries
and investigations under Section
4.11 , the Council or its members shall deal with the Municipal officers and
employees who are subject to the direction and supervision of the Manager
solely through the Manager, and neither the Council nor its members shall give
any orders to any such officer or employee, either publicly or privately.

SECTION 4.05.   VACANCIES; FORFEITURE OF OFFICE; AND FILLING OF VACANCIES.
   (a)   Vacancies. The office of Councilmember shall become vacant upon the
Councilmember's death, resignation, removal from office in any manner
authorized by this Charter, or forfeiture of office.

Mayor or Councilmember, the decision as to actuality of, the time of, and
duration of, the disability, for purposes of declaring a vacancy, shall be
determined by a majority vote of the remaining members of Council present
within the quorum.
   d.   Filling of Vacancies.  Vacancies in the office of Councilmember shall
be filled within thirty (30) days by vote of a majority of the remaining
members of Council.  If a vacancy occurs in one or more positions among
Councilmembers-elect, Council of the new term shall appoint by majority vote an
eligible citizen of the Municipality of Centerville.  If the Council fails to
do so within thirty (30) days following the occurrence of the vacancy, the
power of Council to fill the vacancy shall lapse and the Mayor shall fill the
vacancy by appointment immediately following the expiration of the said thirty
(30) days.  Any appointee under this section shall qualify under the provisions
of this Charter, shall hold office, and shall serve for the unexpired term and
until a successor is elected and qualified.  (Amended November 2, 1976)
SECTION 4.06.   RECALL.
   The electors shall have the power to remove from office, by recall election,
any elected officer of the Municipality.
   If an elected officer shall have served for six (6) months of a term, a
petition demanding his or her removal may be filed with the Clerk of Council
who shall note thereon the name and address of the elector filing the petition,
and the date of such filing.  Such petition may be circulated in separate
parts, but the separate parts shall be bound together and filed as one
instrument.
   Each part shall contain the name and office of the person whose removal is
sought, and a statement in not more than two hundred (200) words of the grounds
for removal.  Such petition shall be signed by the number of electors which
equals twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of electors voting for the
candidates for Councilmember.  Within ten (10) days after the day on which such
petition is filed, the Clerk of Council shall determine whether or not it meets
the requirements hereof.
   If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition insufficient, the Clerk
shall promptly certify the particulars in which the petition is defective,
deliver a copy of the certificate to the person who filed the petition with the
Clerk, and make a record of such delivery.  Such person shall be allowed a
period of twenty (20) days after the day on which such delivery was made in
which to make the petition sufficient.  If the Clerk of Council shall find the
petition sufficient, the Clerk shall promptly so certify to the Council, shall
deliver a copy of such certificate to the officer whose removal is sought, and
shall make a record of such delivery.  If such officer shall not resign within
five (5) days after the day on which such delivery shall have been made, the
Council shall thereupon fix a day for holding a recall election, not less than
sixty (60) days nor more than seventy-five (75) days after the date of such
delivery.
   At such recall election, conducted by the Board of Elections of Montgomery
County, Ohio, as stated in Section
11.02, this question shall be placed on the ballot: "Shall (naming the officer)
be allowed to continue as (naming the office)?" with provision on the ballot
for voting affirmatively or negatively on such question.  If a majority of the
votes cast at such election shall be voted affirmatively, such officer shall
remain in office.  If a majority of the votes cast shall be voted negatively,
such officer shall be considered as removed, said office shall be deemed
vacant, and such vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter.  The
officer removed by such recall election shall not be eligible for appointment
to the vacancy thereby.
(Amended November 2, 1976)
SECTION 4.07.   COMPENSATION.
   The Council may determine the annual salary of Councilmembers by ordinance,
but no ordinance increasing such salaries shall become effective until the
commencement of the terms of Councilmembers elected at the next regular
election, provided that such election follows the adoption of such ordinance by
at least six (6) months.  The Mayor shall receive additional compensation. 
Councilmembers, by resolution of Council, stating the exact purpose of the
appropriation, may receive their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the
performance of their duties of office.
(Amended November 2, 1976)
SECTION 4.08.    JUDGE OF QUALIFICATIONS.
   The Council shall be the sole judge of the election and qualifications of
its Councilmembers-elect and its own members, and the grounds for forfeiture of
their office, as listed in Section
4.05, and for that purpose Council, by ordinance, shall prescribe the process
of citing witnesses, administering oaths and producing evidence, and its
enforcement through the Department of Law.  If, by an affirmative vote of five
(5) members of Council, a witness is declared in violation of the ordinance
enforcing this section, the case shall be referred to the Department of Law for
appropriate action before the proper court.
   A member charged with conduct constituting grounds for forfeiture of office
shall be entitled to a public hearing on demand, and notice of such hearing
shall be published in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the
Municipality at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the hearing.  (Amended
November 2, 1976)
SECTION 4.09.   CLERK OF COUNCIL.
   There shall be a Clerk of Council, selected by vote of a majority of all
members of the Council, from outside its membership, to serve until a successor
is chosen and enters upon the duties of this office. The Clerk shall give
notice of Council meetings and all other meetings as required by State law,
keep the journal, advertise public hearings, record in a separate book all
ordinances and resolutions approved by Council, and see that such enactments
are published as required by this Charter. The Clerk shall perform such other

Council.  The Clerk may be appointed to serve full or part-time and shall
receive a salary for services as such, as established by ordinance.
(Amended November 2, 1976)
SECTION 4.10.   PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Meetings.  The Council shall meet regularly at least once in every
month at such times and places as the Council may prescribe by rule.  Special

Councilmembers and, whenever practicable, upon no less than twenty-four (24)
hours notice, or as prescribed by the Ohio Revised Code, to each member and to
the media that have requested notification, except in the event of an emergency
requiring immediate action.  All meetings where official business is
consummated shall be public except as otherwise provided by Ohio statute or by
ordinance. 
   (b)   Rules and Journal.  The Council shall adopt and may amend its own
rules and order of business, in conformity with this Charter, and shall provide
for keeping a journal of its proceedings.  This journal shall be a public
record.
   (c)   Voting. On resolutions, ordinances and motions, voting need not be by
roll call unless specifically requested by a member of Council.  All votes

compel the attendance of absent members in the manner and subject to the
penalties prescribed by the rules of the Council.  No action of the Council,
except as otherwise provided in the preceding sentence and in Sections 4.05,
4.08, 5.05, 5.08, 6.04, 7.07 and 12.04(a), shall be valid or binding unless
adopted by the affirmative vote of four (4) or more members of the Council. 
(Amended November 2, 1976; November 6, 1984; November 7, 2017)
SECTION 4.11.   INVESTIGATIONS.
   The Council may make investigations through and with the Manager into the

ordinance the penalties for the failure or refusal of any person to obey a
lawful order issued in the exercise of these powers as prescribed in Section
4.08.
SECTION 4.12.   INDEPENDENT AUDIT.
   During those years in which the State of Ohio shall make an audit of the

requirements of this section.  In any other years, Council may, when it deems
it advisable, provide for an annual audit by a certified public accountant or
firm of such accountants.
ARTICLE V

(Amended November 7, 2017)
SECTION 5.02.   INTRODUCTION OF ORDINANCES.
   Every proposed ordinance shall be introduced in written or printed form
after review by the Department of Law on the question of correct legal form, of
possible contradiction with existing ordinances, or conflict with the Charter
or Constitutional provisions.  It shall be in the form required by Council for
final adoption.  No ordinance shall contain more than one subject which shall
be clearly expressed in its title.  The enacting clause shall be "The
Municipality of Centerville hereby ordains...".  Any ordinance which amends an
existing ordinance or part of the Municipal Code shall set out in full the
ordinance, sections or subsections to be amended, and shall indicate matter to
be omitted by enclosing it in brackets or by strike-out type and shall indicate
new matter by underscoring or by italics. Ordinances to be repealed may be
referred to by title or section number only and need not be set out in full.
(Amended November 6, 1984; November 3, 1992)
SECTION 5.03.  PASSAGE OF ORDINANCES.
   A proposed ordinance may be introduced by any Councilmember at any regular
or special meeting of the Council.  Upon introduction of any proposed
ordinance, the Clerk of Council shall distribute a copy to each Councilmember
and to the Manager, shall file one (1) copy in the office of the Clerk of
Council, shall make copies available to interested parties, and shall publish
the proposed ordinance, together with a notice setting out the time and place
for a public hearing thereon and for its consideration by the Council.  (As
used in this section, the term "publish" means to post in full on the City of
Centerville website or generally accepted electronic methods and to post in
full in not less than three (3) of the most public places in the Municipality
as determined by Council. Such posting places shall be reviewed every two
years.)
   A public hearing shall follow the publication by at least seven (7) days,
may be held separately or in connection with a regular or special Council
meeting and may adjourn from time to time.  All persons interested shall have
an opportunity to be heard.  After the hearing, the Council may adopt the
proposed ordinance with or without amendment or reject it, but if it is amended
as to any matter of substance, the Council may not adopt it until the ordinance
or its amended sections have been subjected to all the procedures hereinbefore
required in the case of a newly introduced ordinance.  Within ten (10) days
after adoption of any ordinance, the Clerk shall have it published again,
together with a notice of its adoption.
(Amended November 2, 1976; November 7, 2017)
SECTION 5.04.   EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Except as otherwise provided in this Charter, every ordinance shall become
effective at the expiration of thirty (30) days after adoption or at any later
date specified therein.
SECTION 5.05.   EMERGENCY ORDINANCES.
   To meet a public emergency affecting health, safety, morals, or the public
welfare, or a special emergency in the operation of a Municipal department or
agency, the Council may adopt one or more emergency ordinances, but such
ordinances may not: levy taxes, except when incidental to incurring debt;
grant, renew, or extend a franchise, except one affecting health.  An emergency
ordinance shall be introduced in the form and manner prescribed for ordinances
generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance
and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an
emergency exists and describing it in clear and specific terms.  A proposed
emergency ordinance may be adopted with or without amendment or rejected at the
meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least five
(5) members of Council shall be required for adoption.  After its adoption the
ordinance shall be published as prescribed for other adopted ordinances.  It
shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it may specify.
An emergency ordinance may be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in
the same manner specified in this section for adoption of emergency
ordinances.  No emergency ordinance shall be subject to the initiative and
referendum.  (Amended November 2, 1976; November 3, 1992; November 7, 2017)
SECTION 5.06.   ADOPTION OF ORDINANCES BY REFERENCE.
   The Council may adopt model or standard codes prepared and published by any
public or private agency by reference to the date and source of the code
without reproducing it at length in the ordinance.  However, if the Council
desires to modify, add to or eliminate from any such code any section or part
thereof, such addition, modification or omission shall be clearly stated in the
ordinance.  In all such cases in which such a code shall be adopted by
reference, publication of the code at length, by the Municipality, shall not be
required.  However, at least one (1) copy of all such codes, including all
amendments thereto, shall be kept in the office of the Clerk of Council for
consultation by interested persons during regular office hours and additional
copies shall be for sale, when available, at cost, by the Clerk of Council.

be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.

202.05   CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

section, such reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any provision
of the section, sections, divisions or subdivisions included in the reference.

202.06   DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the Constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;

      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)

(ORC 1.48)

of Council, may consider, among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;

      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws

(ORC 1.49)
202.07   CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. 
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
   (d)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings
of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to
be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
   (e)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of this
Municipal Code, or between any of the provisions of this Municipal Code and a
provision of any standard code adopted by the Municipality pursuant to Section
5.06 of the City Charter, the provision that establishes the higher or stricter
standard shall control.  In the event of a conflict between any of the
provisions of this Municipal Code and any provision of State law, including
rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to State law, the State law, rule or
regulation shall control in those areas where conformity to State law is
required by Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution, and the
provision of this Municipal Code shall control in all other cases.
202.08   GENERAL REPEALER.
   All ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations of the Municipality, and
all parts of the same, enacted prior to the date of the adoption of this
Municipal Code and inconsistent or in conflict with any of the provisions of
this Municipal Code, are hereby repealed, save and except any ordinance,
resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same, expressly excepted from
repeal by the ordinance that adopts this Municipal Code. No ordinance,
resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same, of the Municipality, that
is not inconsistent or in conflict with any of the provisions of this Municipal
Code and/or that can be reasonably interpreted to be compatible with the
provisions of this Municipal Code, shall be deemed to be repealed by the
adoption of this Municipal Code. Such ordinances, resolutions, rules and
regulations, and all parts of the same, shall continue to be viable and
enforceable by the Municipality.
202.09   SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of this Municipal Code, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are separable. 
(ORC 1.50)
202.99     GENERAL CODE PENALTY.
   Whenever, in this Municipal Code, any act is prohibited or is made or
declared to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing
of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful,
the commission or performance of such act, or the failure to commit or perform
such act, as required, shall, unless another penalty is provided, be deemed a
minor misdemeanor and the offender shall be fined not more than one hundred
dollars ($100.00) for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or
continues, unless otherwise provided.
CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from
2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in
October. Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio Legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.

206.01   APPLICATION OF CHAPTER; PURPOSE.
   A Code of Ethics, as provided in this chapter, is hereby established for all
elected and appointed public officials of the City, including Council and all
board and commission members.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish ethical standards of conduct by
setting forth those actions that are in conflict with the best interest of the
community and by directing disclosure of any financial or personal beneficial
interest in matters affecting the City.
(Ord. 51-79. Passed 11-5-79.)
206.02   CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   No public official, whether paid or unpaid, shall engage in any business or
transaction or shall have a financial or other personal interest, direct or
indirect, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her
official duties in the public interest or would tend to impair his or her
independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her official
duties. “Personal” as distinguished from “financial interest” includes an
interest arising from blood or marital relationships or close business or
political associations. Specific areas of potential conflicts of interest are
set forth as follows:
   (a)   Employment. It is hereby recognized that public officials shall retain
their rights as citizens to pursue interests of a personal and economic nature
and to accept employment and follow other pursuits which do not interfere with
the full and faithful discharge of their public duties. No specific
occupations, per se, are deemed to be essentially incompatible with public
office. However, it is recognized that on occasion there may develop specific
conflicts between personal, financial or other private interests of a public
official and the public interest. On those occasions the public official must
take specific actions and refrain from specific actions as set forth in this
chapter.
(Ord. 51-79. Passed 11-5-79.)
   (b)   Legislation, Contracts or Other Public Matters. A public official who
has a personal, financial or other private interest in any proposed
legislation, contract award or other public matter shall:
      (1)   Not engage in any discussion with other City officials or employees
of the City, either formally or informally, about the specific situation; and
      (2)   Disclose on the record that a conflict exists or may be perceived
to exist and physically exit the meeting or discussion until such time as the
discussion is ended or the legislation or other matter is acted upon.
(Ord. 6-84. Passed 3-19-84.)
   (c)   Representation of Private Interests. No public official shall
represent or appear on behalf of a private interest, other than his or her own
personal residential interest, in any matter pending before any element of the
City government. He or she shall not represent a private interest in any action
or proceeding against the interests of the City in any litigation to which the
City is a party. A member of Council may appear before elements of the City
government on behalf of constituents in the course of his or her duties as a
representative of the electorate or in the performance of public or civic
obligations. However, no public official shall accept a retainer or other
compensation that is contingent upon a specific action by the City.
   (d)   Use of Influence. No public official shall use or attempt to use his
or her public position or office to obtain financial gain or unlawful benefits,
advantages or privileges for himself or herself, for his or her immediate
family or for any business with which he or she is associated. Financial gain
shall not include regularly approved compensation for salary or expenses.
   (e)   Confidential Information. No public official may use or disclose
confidential information acquired by him or her in the course of his or her
official duties, in any way that could result in financial gain for himself or
herself or any member of his or her immediate family, either directly or
indirectly.
   (f)   Gifts and Favors. No public official shall accept or solicit anything
of value; whether in the form of a gift or promise of a gift, from any person,
firm or corporation which, to his or her knowledge, is involved in business
dealings with the City. For purposes of this chapter, a gift shall include the
receipt of any goods, services or loans for an amount less than the amount
charged to the general public for like goods, services or loans, provided,
however, that any public official may accept food or drink for immediate
consumption when offered in a situation which is in a normal business context
or in the nature of a social context.
   (g)   Special Treatment. No public official shall grant any special
consideration, treatment or advantage to any citizen beyond that which is
reasonably available to every other citizen.
(Ord. 51-79. Passed 11-5-79.)
206.03   APPLICATION OF STATE LAW.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed in any way to restrict the
application of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code or common law provisions
with respect to conflicts of interest or malfeasance, misfeasance or
nonfeasance in office which would otherwise be applicable to any person subject
to the provisions of this chapter. The provisions of this chapter shall be
deemed additional requirements and shall in no way be construed as a derogation
under home rule of present statutory penalties and other local remedies for
acts prohibited by this chapter.
(Ord. 51-79. Passed 11-5-79.)
206.04   VIOLATIONS; CENSURE, SUSPENSIONS, REMOVAL FROM OFFICE, ETC.
   A violation of any provision of this chapter may constitute a cause for
censure by City Council and recommendation for or against suspension, removal
from office or other disciplinary action by the appropriate authority after due
notice and hearing.
(Ord. 51-79. Passed 11-5-79.)

208.01   DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter, the following words shall have the meanings
given herein:
   (a)   “Complainant” means any person who has filed a complaint.
   (b)   “Complaint” means a formal written complaint filed with the Manager in
the form of an affidavit made on personal knowledge alleging misfeasance,
malfeasance or nonfeasance by a respondent in the conduct of the affairs or
administration of the City.
   (c)   “Respondent” means any person or Municipal department, division, board
or commission against whom a complaint has been filed.
(Ord. 11-87.  Passed 5-18-87.)
208.02   CONTENTS OF COMPLAINTS; RECORDS.
   (a)   A complaint filed with the Manager shall be made under oath and shall
set forth the following:
      (1)   A detailed description of the conduct alleged to constitute
misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance, including a reference to any law,
ordinance or regulation allegedly violated.
      (2)   The names of all individuals believed to have information
concerning the alleged violation.
   (b)   Complaints shall be numbered consecutively and recorded under the
complaint number in a permanent ledger.  All subsequent action taken on each
complaint shall also be recorded in that ledger.  The ledger shall be kept by
the Manager.
(Ord. 11-87.  Passed 5-18-87.)
208.03   PRESENTATION OF COMPLAINTS TO COUNCIL.
   (a)   The Manager shall inform Council of the filing of a complaint and
shall present the complaint at an executive session of Council pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 121.22(G)(1).  Such executive session shall be held during the first
Council meeting subsequent to the receipt of a complaint by the Manager.
   (b)   An investigation of any complaint so presented shall commence only
upon an affirmative vote by at least four members of Council that the facts
alleged in the complaint, if true, constitute misfeasance, malfeasance or
nonfeasance by the respondent in the conduct of Municipal affairs or
administration.  Any such vote of Council shall be taken in a public meeting
immediately following the executive session.  If less than a majority of
Council vote to commence an investigation, or if no vote is taken at that
meeting, the complaint shall be deemed dismissed.
   If at least four members of Council vote to commence an investigation, a
copy of the complaint, together with notice that an investigation is in
process, shall be provided to the respondent within three business days from
said vote.  Such service shall be made to the respondent either personally or
by certified mail, return receipt requested, delivery restricted to the
addressee only, at his or her last known address on the records of the City.
   (c)   Neither the name of any respondent nor the allegations in the
complaint shall be referred to or discussed in a public meeting.  Rather, the
complaint shall be identified only by its assigned number.  This subsection
shall prevail over any contrary provisions of the Council rules or any other
ordinance of the City.
   (d)   Since Ohio R.C. 121.22(G)(1) allows the investigation of complaints
against public employees and officials and the consideration of dismissal or
discipline of such employees and officials to be conducted in private executive
sessions, all records, proceedings and documents relating to complaints and any
hearings thereon shall remain confidential until the investigation is
terminated or dismissed and as provided in Sections
208.04(g) and
208.06(c). 
(Ord. 11-87.  Passed 5-18-87.)
208.04   INVESTIGATORY PROCEDURES.
   (a)   The Manager shall investigate the complaint, gathering all available
evidence both supporting and refuting the complaint.
   (b)   The investigation by the Manager shall be completed within six weeks
after the vote by Council to commence such investigation.  An extension of this
time may be granted by Council for good cause shown.
   (c)   The Manager shall prepare a written report of the findings of the
investigation.  The report shall include a recommendation as to whether the
investigation should be continued or the complaint be dismissed.  The written
report shall be presented and discussed at an executive session of Council held
during the first Council meeting subsequent to the completion of the
investigation.
   (d)   If, in a public meeting immediately following the executive session,
at least four members of Council vote that there is probable cause to believe
the allegations occurred, the Manager shall schedule an executive session
hearing on the matter.  If at least four members of Council do not vote that
there is probable cause, or if no vote is taken at that meeting, the complaint
shall be deemed dismissed.
   (e)   The provisions of Section
208.03(c) shall apply to said public meeting.
   (f)   If the complaint is not dismissed, written notice of the date, time
and place of the hearing thereon shall be served upon the respondent and
complainant within seven working days of said public meeting, personally or by
certified mail to the last known address of each on the records of the City,
return receipt requested, delivery restricted to the addressee only.  Such
notice shall also include a statement of the alleged violation and shall inform
the respondent and the complainant of his or her right, and of the right of the
Manager, to be represented by counsel, to examine evidence against him or her,
to produce evidence, to call and subpoena witnesses, to confront his or her
accusers and to cross- examine witnesses.
   (g)   If the complaint is dismissed, Council and the Manager shall make a
public report of the findings if requested to do so by any respondent. 
However, all evidence and other matters referred to in Section
208.03(d) shall remain confidential, unless a respondent specifically requests
that it also be made public.
   (h)   If the Manager is named as a respondent in any complaint, or if
Council finds that the Manager has a personal interest in the results of any
investigation, Council may remove the Manager from all duties under this
chapter and appoint an independent investigator who shall assume all the duties
and powers given the Manager hereunder.
(Ord. 11-87.  Passed 5-18-87.)
208.05   HEARINGS.
   (a)   A hearing shall be set by the Manager to be held no less than thirty
days nor more than forty-five days after the Council meeting at which the
investigation report is given and probable cause to proceed is found.
   (b)   The Manager may grant continuances at the request of the respondent,
the complainant or the Council, or upon his or her own volition, if the
interest of justice so requires.  Such requests must be in writing and filed
with the Manager no later than seven days prior to the scheduled hearing.  Such
a request shall contain a brief written statement setting forth the reasons for
the requested continuance.  Each continuance granted by the Manager shall be to
a date certain, not to exceed forty-five days after the previously scheduled
hearing.
   (c)   All hearings under this section shall be held in private executive
session pursuant to Ohio R.C. 121.22, unless the respondent requests a public
hearing, in which case the hearing shall be held in public.
   (d)   A record of all hearings shall be made, and the parties shall have the
rights described in Section
208.04(d) through (f).
   (e)   The Council may appoint one of its members as presiding officer or may
appoint as such officer any attorney at law licensed to practice in the State,
whether or not that attorney is a member of Council.  The activities of such a
non-Councilmember presiding officer shall be limited to the administration of
the hearing and decisions regarding the procedure at the hearing.  The Manager
shall present the evidence against the respondent to the complainant or may
delegate this task to an attorney named by the Manager for this task.
   (f)   All testimony given at any such hearing, whether public or in
executive session, shall be taken under oath.  The presiding officer shall
conduct the hearing so as to afford due process of law to the respondent and
the complaining party.
   (g)   Council shall serve as the hearing body in all investigations.  Its
decisions shall be final, and there shall be no administrative appeal from any
decision or recommendation of Council made in such capacity.
(Ord. 11-87.  Passed 5-18-87.)
208.06   FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS; DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINTS.
   (a)   If, upon evidence given at the hearing, at least four members of
Council find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the facts alleged in the
complaint and/or in the investigation report are true and that such facts
constitute misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance in the conduct of Municipal
affairs or administration, the Council shall state its findings of a violation
and make a recommendation of appropriate action.
   (b)   If Council does not so find a violation by a preponderance of the
evidence, the complaint shall be dismissed.
   (c)   If a complaint is dismissed after a hearing under Section
208.05, Council and the Manager shall make public the report of its findings if
requested to do so by any respondent.  However, all evidence, other matters
referred to in Section
208.03(d) and the transcript of the hearing shall remain confidential, unless a
respondent specifically requests that it also be made public. 
(Ord. 11-87.  Passed 5-18-87.)
208.07   INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF COUNCIL.
   For the purpose of investigations and hearings hereunder, the Council shall
be vested with the following rights, powers and prerogatives, all of which may
be exercised by the presiding officer appointed by Council:
   (a)   To compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books,
papers and other evidence and to issue subpoenas or attachments therefor.  No
officer or employee of the City shall, by virtue of such office or employment,
be exempt from being called as a witness.  The Council, through its presiding
officer, shall exercise the foregoing powers on behalf of and upon request of
the Manager and of any respondent.
   (b)   To appoint any police officer or other person to serve subpoenas for
witnesses.
   (c)   To appoint any police officer or other person to maintain order and

necessary in order to carry on the investigation at hand.
   (e)   To administer oaths.
(Ord. 11-87.  Passed 5-18-87.)
208.08   WITNESS FEES.
   Each witness who is not an officer or employee of the City subpoenaed

each day in attendance or six dollars ($6.00) for each half day in attendance
at any hearing or deposition.
(Ord. 11-87.  Passed 5-18-87.)
208.09   COMPENSATION OF AGENTS OF INVESTIGATING UNITS.
   The compensation to be paid for the service of subpoenas or the performance
of any other acts or duties authorized or specified by this chapter shall be
fixed by the Manager on the approval of the City Council, except that no
compensation in addition to regular compensation shall be so allowed to any
duly elected or appointed official or to any employee in the classified or
unclassified service of the City.
(Ord. 11-87.  Passed 5-18-87.)
208.10   FAILURE OR REFUSAL OF WITNESSES TO TESTIFY.

   (c)   The authorization contained in subsections (a) and (b) hereof shall
include, but shall not be limited to, contracts involving the joint purchase of

authorities, provided, however, that with respect to the Manager's authority
under subsection (a) hereof requiring no bids, he or she shall not have the

   (e)   The Manager is authorized to designate any one or more employees for
the limited purpose of signing any contract or agreement or groups of contracts
or agreements allowed pursuant to Section
210.01(a) above, on behalf of the City, as long as such designation is in

   (b)   Either the Dayton Daily News or the Centerville Dispatch are hereby

   The Manager or his or her designee, at a time specified in the advertisement
provided for in Section

   Each bid shall contain the full name of each person or company interested
therein and shall be accompanied by a sufficient bond or certified check on a
solvent bank of not less than five percent of the amount of the bid, the
condition of such bond or certified check being that if a bid is accepted a
contract will be entered into and its performance properly secured.  If the
work bid embraces both labor and material, such  items shall be separately
stated with the price thereof. The Manager may reject any bid where there is
reason to believe there is collusion or combination among bidders, upon
nonsubmission of a sufficient bond or certified check, or for other reasons
where there are sufficient grounds to do so.
   The Manager may establish prequalifications for bidders, including
references and a statement of similar work performed.
   No bid submitted under this procedure may be altered or modified on or after
the date and time specified in the invitation to bidders.
   Bids shall not be split between or among bidders, and if this occurs, it
shall be sufficient cause for rejection of the bid or bids. (Ord. 13-69. Passed
4-7-69.)
210.041   REVERSE AUCTION METHOD OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING.
   (a)   As used in this section:

and nonfederal interoperable packet switched data networks, including the
graphical subnetwork called the world wide web.
      (2)   “Reverse auction” means a purchasing process in which offerors
submit proposals in competition to sell services or supplies in an open
environment via the internet.
      (3)   “Services” means the furnishing of labor, time, or effort by a
person, not involving the delivery of a specific end product other than a
report which, if provided, is merely incidental to the required performance.
“Services” does not include services furnished pursuant to employment
agreements or collective bargaining agreements.
      (4)   “Supplies” means all property, including, but not limited to,
equipment, materials, other tangible assets, and insurance, but excluding real

by competitive sealed bidding or competitive sealed proposals and the Manager
determines that the use of a reverse auction is advantageous to the City, the
Manager, in accordance with this section, may purchase services or supplies by
reverse auction.

obtained by utilizing formal or informal bidding procedures to purchase similar

be made in accordance with estimates of the amount and value of the work
accomplished.  The certificates or estimates shall include only the amount and
value of the work accomplished and materials used since any preceding
estimate.  Such certificates or estimates shall further indicate that a greater
portion of the contract has been performed by the contracting party than that
which is represented by the requested partial payment, in addition to any
preceding partial payments.  Upon receiving such certificates, estimates or
invoices, properly certified, the Director of Finance shall then issue warrants
in payment.  A percentage may be withheld by the Manager on any contract as a
guarantee of proper performance of the contract.

CHAPTER 211
Investment and Deposit Policy
211.01   Policy.
211.02   Scope.
211.03   Objectives.
211.04   Standards of care.
211.05   Maturity.
211.06   Diversification.
211.07   Authorized financial institutions and dealers.
211.08   Central depository.

211.13   Competitive quotes.
211.14   Safekeeping and custody.
211.15   Reporting.
211.16   Policy considerations.
211.01   POLICY.
   It is the policy of the City of Centerville (“City”) to invest public funds
in a manner which will provide the highest investment return with maximum
security while meeting all liquidity and operating demands of the City. All
investment activities must conform with all applicable State and local statutes
governing the investment of public funds.
(Ord. 29-07.  Passed 1-28-08.)
211.02   SCOPE.
   (a)   This Investment and Deposit Policy (“Policy”) applies to all financial
assets of the City. The City funds subject to this policy are hereinafter
referred to as the “Active Portfolio.”
   (b)   The Director of Finance is authorized to pool cash balances from all
funds of the City for investment purposes. All interest earnings will be
credited to the fund from which the cash balance was drawn.
(Ord. 29-07.  Passed 1-28-08.)
211.03   OBJECTIVES.
   The primary objectives of investment activities, in order of priority, shall
be safety, liquidity and yield:
   (a)   Safety of Principal.  Safety of principal is the foremost objective of
the City. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the
preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. This is accomplished by:
      (1)   Limiting investments to the securities authorized by this policy.
      (2)   Pre-qualifying the financial institutions, broker/dealers, and
advisors with which the City will do business.
      (3)   Diversifying the investment portfolio so that potential losses on
individual securities will not significantly affect the safety of the
portfolio.
      (4)   Structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to
meet cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to
sell securities on the open market prior to maturity.
      (5)   Committing to a staggered-maturity (“laddered”) portfolio to
provide an opportunity to regularly reinvest as well as to enhance liquidity.
   (b)   Liquidity.  The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid
to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is
accomplished by:
      (1)   Structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent with
cash needs to meet anticipated demands.
      (2)   The portfolio should consist largely of securities with active
secondary or resale markets.
      (3)   A portion of the portfolio should be placed in money market funds
or local government pools (STAR Ohio) which offer same-day liquidity for short-
term funds.
   (c)   Return on Investments.  The investment portfolio shall be designed
with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary
and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints and
liquidity needs. Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to
the safety and liquidity objectives described above.
      (Ord. 29-07.  Passed 1-28-08.)
211.04   STANDARDS OF CARE.
   (a)   Delegation of Authority.  Authority to manage the City's investment
program is derived from
Chapter 234  of the Centerville Municipal Code. Management responsibility for
the investment program is hereby delegated to the Director of Finance, who
shall act in accordance with established written procedures and internal
controls for the operation of the investment program, consistent with this
investment policy. The Director of Finance shall be responsible for all
transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate
the activities of subordinate officials. No person may engage in an investment
transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the
procedures established by the Director of Finance.
   (b)   Prudence.  The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials
shall be the “prudent person” and/or “prudent investor” standard, and shall be
applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers
acting in accordance with written procedures and this investment policy and
exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an
individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations
from expectations are reported in timely fashion and the actions of the
investment officer are in accordance with this policy.
   (c)   Ethics and Conflicts of Interest.  Officers and employees involved in
the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could
conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or
that could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions.
Employees and investment officials shall disclose to the City Manager any
material financial interests that could be related to the performance of the
City's investments.
(Ord. 29-07.  Passed 1-28-08.)
211.05   MATURITY.
   To the extent possible, the City will attempt to match the term to maturity
of its investments with the anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched
to a specific cash flow requirement, the City will not directly invest in
securities maturing more than five years from the date of settlement or having
an average life or duration greater than five years.
(Ord. 29-07.  Passed 1-28-08.)
211.06   DIVERSIFICATION.
   (a)   The investment portfolio shall be diversified by:
      (1)   Avoiding over-concentration in securities from a specific issuer or
business sector (excluding securities issued by the United States government or
an agency or instrumentality thereof). The following maximum allocations are
established:
         A.   Certificates of deposit: no more than 50% of the total market
value of the portfolio;
         B.   Commercial paper and bankers acceptances: No more than 25% of the
total market value of the portfolio may be committed to these two
classifications combined;
         C.   Repurchase agreements, money market funds, STAR Ohio and NOW
accounts: No more than 50% of the total market value of the portfolio may be
committed to these classifications combined.
      (2)   Investing in securities with varying maturities; and
      (3)   Continuously investing a portion of the portfolio in readily
available funds such as money market funds, overnight repurchase agreements or
local government investment pools to ensure appropriate liquidity is maintained
in order to meet ongoing obligations.
   (b)   No transaction needs to be executed when, through inadvertence or
unusual circumstances, a maturity in the active portfolio causes the percentage
of a type or category of investment to exceed the diversification limits set
forth above. Any transactions after such infraction shall work toward returning
to compliance.
(Ord. 29-07.  Passed 1-28-08.)
211.07   AUTHORIZED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND DEALERS.

deposit policy requirements are met;
      (2)   Shall make deletions from the list: (i) if and as directed by
ordinance of City Council; (ii) upon failure of the financial institution to
meet the requirement of this policy; or (iii) upon request of the financial
institution or dealer; and
      (3)   May make deletions from the list based on the following:
         A.   Perceived financial difficulties of the financial institution or
dealer;
         B.   Consistent lack of competitiveness by the financial institution
or dealer;
         C.   Lack of experience or familiarity of the account representative
in providing service to large institutional accounts; or

(Ord. 29-07.  Passed 1-28-08.)

will have the same opportunity as other eligible financial institutions to
provide quotes on the investment of the City's excess funds.
(Ord. 29-07.  Passed 1-28-08.)

218.03   INSPECTION.
   (a)   All public records maintained by the City shall be promptly prepared
and made available for inspection to any person during regular business hours.
Prompt inspection and copies of records within a reasonable amount of time
contemplates the opportunity for legal review.  The time for compliance with a
request for public records will depend upon the availability of records, the
manner in which they are kept, and the volume of records requested.
   (b)   A public records request may be written or verbal. The Public Records
Custodian may ask the requester to put a verbal request in writing, may ask for
the requester to give identifying information, or may inquire about the
intended use of the information; but a written request is not mandatory,
identifying information is not required and the intended use does not have to
be disclosed. However, providing such information would benefit the requester
by enhancing the ability of the Public Records Custodian to identify, locate
and deliver the public records requested.
   (c)   Public records can be accessed by one of the following methods: a
request to view public records in person; a request for copies of public
records that the requester will personally pick up from the Public Records
Custodian; or a request for copies of public records that the requester wants
to have mailed or otherwise transmitted to the requester.
   (d)   Request to View Public Records. The requester may make a request to
view public records. The Public Records Custodian shall prepare the public
records for inspection promptly, as required by the Ohio Revised Code. The
actual time required to comply with the request may depend on the
circumstances, such as the location of the records, the manner kept or the
volume of records requested.
   (e)   Copies of Public Records. The requester may make a request to the
Public Records Custodian to have copies of public records made.
   (f)   Transmitting Copies of Public Records. A requester may request that
copies of public records be transmitted to him or her by U.S. Mail or by any
other means of transmission that is available and is conducive to transmitting
the public records. The cost of transmission must be paid by the requester
before the public records will be provided.
   (g)   The number of records requested by a person that the City will
transmit by United States mail shall be limited to ten records per month,
unless the person verifies to the City in writing that the person does not
intend to use or forward the requested records or the information contained in
them for commercial purposes as defined in Ohio R.C. 149.43(b)(7).
   (h)   While the City is under no obligation to provide records in electronic
format, it is the policy of the City to provide information to the public in
the most practical and convenient manner, considering all of the circumstances.
Therefore, if the City receives a request for information to be made available
in an electronic format, such request will be forwarded to the Public Records
Custodian for a determination as to whether such information will be generated
and released in an electronic format.
(Ord. 15-07.  Passed 10-15-07; Ord. 10-10.  Passed 6-21-10.)
218.04   FEES AND PAYMENT.
   (a)   Public records will be provided at the actual cost of copying or
reproducing the records. The requester shall also pay the actual cost (postage)
of delivery and other supplies used in the mailing, delivery or transmission of
the public record. Payment for public records requests must be made prior to
the actual copying of the records.
   (b)   Copies made on letter or legal size paper are five cents ($0.05) per
page. If the Public Records Custodian uses an outside copying service to make
the copies, the requester will be required to pay the cost of the entire
copying job, as billed by the copying service. Copies that are requested in
some format other than normal letter or legal paper will be “at cost,” without
taking into account employee time spent preparing the copies. For example,
public records in electronic format placed on a CD will be assessed the cost of
the CD, plus the cost, if any, of creating the electronic copies.
   (c)   Public records will only be copied by the Public Records Custodian or
other authorized officers, employees or representatives. The Public Records
Custodian may use an outside copying service to make the copies, at the Public
Records Custodian's discretion. Under no circumstances will the requester be
permitted to make the copies himself or herself. The manner of copying is at
the discretion of the Public Records Custodian. Requests to copy a certain
number of public records on a given page, by reducing copy size or otherwise,
may be met at the discretion of the Public Records Custodian.
   (d)   If fewer than 20 pages of copies are requested, no fee will be
charged. If the request exceeds 20 pages, the fee will be five cents ($0.05)
per page for all pages copied.
(Ord. 15-07.  Passed 10-15-07; Ord. 10-10.  Passed 6-21-10.)
218.05   DENIAL OF A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   (a)   Under certain circumstances, records are not defined as “public
records” under Ohio law. In these situations, the public record request will be
denied on that basis. The Ohio Revised Code requires that any denial be
supported by legal authority. A denial that is responding to a written public
records request will also be given in writing. Written reasons for denial will
not be required for verbal public records requests. Any denial of public
records requested must include an explanation, including legal authority. If
portions of a record are public and portions are exempt, the exempt portions
are to be redacted and the rest released. If there are redactions, each
redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation, including legal
authority, unless Federal or State law authorized or requires the redaction.
   (b)   The Ohio Revised Code regards certain actions as being “denials” of
public record requests. These situations are handled as follows:
      (1)   Redaction.
         A.   The Ohio Revised Code defines a “redaction” as “obscuring or
deleting any information that is exempt from the duty to permit public
inspection or copying from an item that otherwise meets the definition of a
'record' in Ohio R.C. 149.011.” Examples of redaction are “blacking out” or
“whiting out” or “cutting out” portions of a document.
         B.   When a public record contains information that is not within the
definition of a public record as defined by law, the Public Records Custodian
will make available that portion of the public record that does meet the
definition of a public record. The Public Records Custodian shall make a copy
of the public record, perform the redaction, then make a copy of that sheet and
make the second copy available to the requester. The requester will not be
charged for the first copy made. If practical, the first copy will be retained
by the Public Records Custodian.
      (2)   Requests that are ambiguous, overly broad, or are difficult to
identify the public records requested. At times, a requester may make a public
records request from which the Public Records Custodian cannot determine which
the public records are being sought. In such circumstances, the Public Records
Custodian will inform the requester that the public records request is denied
but will give the requester an opportunity to more accurately describe the
public records sought. If the requester is seeking public records organized in
a certain way, but the public records are not organized in that way, the Public
Records Custodian will inform the requester of the manner that the public
records of the office under discussion are maintained and accessed. The
requester may then submit a public records request that more accurately
reflects the actual organization of the public records sought.
(Ord. 15-07.  Passed 10-15-07; Ord. 10-10.  Passed 6-21-10.)
218.06   COMPLIANCE.
   The Public Records Custodian reserves the right to consult with legal
counsel prior to the release of any public records. This is to allow the City
to comply with laws regarding the release of certain records.
(Ord. 15-07.  Passed 10-15-07; Ord. 10-10.  Passed 6-21-10.)
218.07   FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST,
   The City recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of failure to
properly respond to a public records request. In addition to the distrust in
government that failure to comply may cause, the City's failure to comply with
a request may result in a court ordering the City to comply with the law and to
pay the requester's attorney's fees, court costs and damages.

   (c)   The public employees blanket bond provided for herein shall be
contingent on the faithful performance of the duties and offices of the
individually covered employees or officers and on the accounting for and paying
over to the proper officer of the City all monies or other property coming into

258.05   RETIREMENT.
   (a)   Public Employees Retirement System (P.E.R.S.). 
      (1)   Effective January 1, 2001, the full amount of the statutorily
required contributions to the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio PERS
shall be withheld from the gross pay of each person within any of the classes
established in paragraph (a)(3) hereof and shall be “picked-up” (assumed and
paid to the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio) by the City.
   This “pick-up” by the City is, and shall be designated as, employee
contributions and shall be in lieu of contributions to the Public Employees
Retirement System by each person within any of the classes established in
paragraph (a)(3) hereof.  No person subject to this “pick-up” shall have the
option of choosing to receive the statutorily required contribution to the
Public Employees Retirement System directly instead of having it “picked- up”
by the City or being excluded from the “pick-up”.
      (2)   The City shall, in reporting and making remittance to the Public
Employees Retirement System, report that the public employee's contribution for
each person subject to this “pick-up” has been made as provided by statute.
      (3)   The “pick-up” by the City provided by this section shall apply to
all persons who are employees of the City who are or become contributing
members of the Public Employees Retirement System.
      (4)   The City's method of payment of salaries to employees who are
participants in the Public Employees Retirement System is hereby modified as
follows, in order to provide for a salary reduction method of “pick-up” of
employee contributions to the Public Employees Retirement System:
         A.   The total salary for each employee shall be the salary otherwise
payable under City policies.  Such total salary of each employee shall be
payable by the City in two parts: (a) deferred salary and (b) cash salary.  An
employee's deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage of that employee's
total salary which is required from time to time by the Public Employees
Retirement System to be paid as an employee contribution by that employee and
shall be paid by the City to the Public Employees Retirement System on behalf
of that employee as a “pick-up” and in lieu of the Public Employees Retirement
System employee contribution otherwise payable by that employee.
         B.   An employee's cash salary shall be equal to the employee's total
salary less the amount of the “pick-up” for that employee, and shall be
payable, subject to applicable payroll deductions, to that employee.  The City
shall compute and remit its employer contributions to the Public Employees
Retirement System based upon an employee's total salary.  The total combined
expenditures of the City for such employees' total salaries payable under
applicable City policies and the “pick-up” provisions of this section shall not
be greater than the amounts the City would have paid for these items had this
provision not been in effect.
      (5)   The Finance Director is hereby authorized and directed to implement
the provisions of this section to institute the “pick-up” of the statutorily
required contributions to the Public Employees Retirement System for those
persons reflected in paragraph (a)(3) hereof so as to enable them to obtain the
result of Federal and State tax deferments and other benefits.
(Ord. 28-00.  Passed 12-18-00.)
   (b)   Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund (O.P.F.P.F.).

required contributions to the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund O.P.F.P.F.
shall be withheld from the gross pay of each person within any of the classes
established in paragraph (b)(3) hereof and shall be “picked-up” (assumed and
paid to the Police and Fire Pension Fund) by the City.  This “pick-up” by the
City is, and shall be designated as, employee contributions and shall be in
lieu of contributions to the Police and Fire Pension Fund by each person within
any of the classes established in paragraph (b)(3) hereof.  No person subject
to this “pick-up” shall have the option of choosing to receive the statutorily
required contribution to the Police and Fire Pension Fund directly instead of
having it “picked-up” by the City or being excluded from the “pick-up”.
      (2)   The City shall, in reporting and making remittance to the Police
and Fire Pension Fund, report that the public employee's contribution for each
person subject to this “pick-up” has been made as provided by statute.
      (3)   The “pick-up” by the City provided by this section shall apply to
all persons who are employees of the City who are or become contributing
members of the Police and Fire Pension Fund.
      (4)   The City's method of payment of salaries to employees who are
participants in the Police and Fire Pension Fund is hereby modified as follows,
in order to provide for a salary reduction method of “pick-up” of employee
contributions to the Police and Fire Pension Fund:
         A.   The total salary for each employee shall be the salary otherwise
payable under City policies.  Such total salary of each employee shall be
payable by the City in two parts: (a) deferred salary and (b) cash salary.  An
employee's deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage of that employee's
total salary which is required from time to time by the Police and Fire Pension
Fund to be paid as an employee contribution by that employee and shall be paid
by the City to the Police and Fire Pension Fund on behalf of that employee as a
“pick-up” and in lieu of the Police and Fire Pension Fund employee contribution
otherwise payable by that employee.
         B.   An employee's cash salary shall be equal to the employee's total
salary less the amount of the “pick-up” for that employee, and shall be
payable, subject to applicable payroll deductions, to that employee.  The City
shall compute and remit its employer contributions to the Police and Fire
Pension Fund based upon an employee's total salary.  The total combined
expenditures of the City for such employees' total salaries payable under
applicable City policies and the “pick-up” provisions of this section shall not
be greater than the amounts the City would have paid for these items had this
provision not been in effect.
      (5)   The Finance Director is hereby authorized and directed to implement
the provisions of this section to institute the “pick-up” of the statutorily

TITLE TEN - Judiciary
         
Chap. 290.   Mayor’s Court.
CHAPTER 290
Mayor’s Court
EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor has jurisdiction to
hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of an ordinance of the
municipal corporation, to hear and determine any case involving a violation of
a vehicle parking or standing ordinance of the municipal corporation unless the
violation is required to be handled by a parking violations bureau or joint
parking violations bureau pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 4521, and to hear and
determine all criminal cases involving any moving traffic violation occurring
on a state highway located within the boundaries of the municipal corporation,
subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and 2938.04.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the violation involves a minor
misdemeanor, the potential penalty does not include the possibility of a prison
or jail term, or the possible fine involved does not exceed one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if
the court in which a defendant is charged with an offense is not a court of
record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such that a right to a jury trial
exists, such matter shall not be tried before him and shall be transferred to a
court of record in the County if the defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. “Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto.”
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the “Ohio Traffic Rules” which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): “Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his
right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality.”
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): “Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date. “Rule 13 provides that a court
shall establish a traffic violation bureau and specifies certain restrictions
as to the designated offenses and schedule of fines to be accepted as waiver
payment in lieu of court appearance.

amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the

citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty
for the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (b)(2)A. of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of
time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for
the violation of the provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period
of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of
the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this Traffic Code
is substantially equivalent.

414.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.  Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence
districts, the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. 
Where two or more through highways designated under this division intersect and
no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic- control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03   TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)

         A.   Operate any vehicle within this Municipality while under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them;
         B.   Subsequent to being arrested for operating the vehicle as
described in division (a)(2)A. of this section, being asked by a law

or (a)(2) and a violation of division (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, but
the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of these divisions.
   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician- paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.  If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense.  The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H.,(a)(1)I. or (a)(1)J.
or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Limitation of liability.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic,  or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician- paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))

continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person's system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person's conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider” has the same meaning as
in R.C. 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section.  The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness.  Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who  otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(c),
(G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(6) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. 
The person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request
of the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest.  Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.,
O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under
State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest
for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face
increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the
Ohio or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the
person and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is
to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the

permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   Duties of officer.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as

section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance

division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.

serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person.  Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance.  If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of
a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge

by division (b)(4) of this section, and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by divisions (b)(10) and (b)(11) of this section.  The end of every school zone
may be marked by a sign indicating the end of the zone.  Nothing in this
section or in the Manual and Specifications for a Uniform System of Traffic-

portion of a State highway under the jurisdiction of the Director of
Transportation or a request from a County Engineer in the case of a school zone
for a special elementary school, the Director may extend the traditional school
zone boundaries.  The distances in divisions (b)(1)C.1. through 3. below shall
not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction, and are bounded by whichever of
the following distances or combination thereof the Director approves as most

lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the

the traditional school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property
lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in divisions (b)
(1)A. and (b)(1)C. of this section.
         E.   As used in this division, “crosswalk” has the meaning given that
term in Ohio R.C. 4511.01(LL)(2).
         F.   The Director may, upon request by resolution of the Legislative
Authority and upon submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic,
and other information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school
zone on any portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that
includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school
during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
in each appropriate direction of the State route.
         G.   As used in this section, “special elementary school” means a
school that meets all of the following:

elementary school annually sends a report to the superintendent of the school
district in which the special elementary school is located indicating the total
number of students enrolled at the school, but otherwise the principal or other
person in charge does not report any other information or data to the
superintendent.

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of

an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss arising from an accident
or collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offender’s

minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under division

valid permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver's
or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.

noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours.
   The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed
by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02
(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under division (c)(2) of this section, if

if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).

offense is registered in the offender's name, criminal forfeiture to the state
of the offender's vehicle. The order of criminal forfeiture shall be issued and
enforced in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.234. If title to a motor vehicle

assigned or transferred and Ohio R.C. 4503.234(B)(2) or (3) applies, the court
may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of
the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from any fine so
imposed shall be distributed in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.234(C)(2).

with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that

grants limited driving privileges during a suspension imposed under this
section, the privileges shall be granted on the additional condition that the
offender must display restricted license plates, issued under Ohio R.C.
4503.231, on the vehicle driven subject to the privileges, except as provided
in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver's license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
Ohio R.C. 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from

issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant
restraining device unless the physician or chiropractor, in issuing the
affidavit, acted in a manner that constituted willful, wanton, or reckless
misconduct.
      (7)   The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall adopt rules in accordance
with R.C. Chapter 119 establishing a process for a person to be included in the
database under division (c)(5) of this section. The information provided and
included in the database under division (c)(5) of this section is not a public
record subject to inspection or copying under R.C. § 149.43.
   (d)   Officers Not Permitted to Stop Cars to Determine Violation. 
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law enforcement
officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on any street
or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of determining whether a
violation of division (b) of this section has been or is being committed or for
the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or summons for the violation or
for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for the
violation.  No law enforcement officer shall view the interior or visually
inspect any automobile being operated on any street or highway for the sole
purpose of determining whether the violation has been or is being committed.
   (e)   Use of Fines for Educational Program.  All fines collected for
violations of division (b) of this section shall be forwarded to the State
Treasurer for deposit in the funds as set forth in Ohio R.C. 4513.263(E).
   (f)   Limitations on Evidence Used for Prosecution.
      (1)   Subject to division (f)(2) of this section, the failure of a person
to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section or
the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject
to the penalty set forth in Section
408.02.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The Municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
Ohio R.C. 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the State highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality.  No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the State highway
system.  The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the Municipality.  Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued.  The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section.  If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure.  In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit.  No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Streets.  No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified in Section
440.02 or exceeding a gross weight of three tons, upon any street in the
Municipality other than State routes, except those local streets designated as
a truck route and marked as such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when
such operation is necessary to load or unload property, to go to or from the
usual place of storage of such vehicle or to perform any other legitimate
business or act other than passage through the Municipality. Operators of
vehicles so deviating from either a State route or a designated truck route
within the Municipality shall confine such deviation to that required in order
to accomplish the purpose of the departure.
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Manager may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an oversize
or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets and
highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Manager may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or for
such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Manager in his or her
discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction project.
The Manager may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of operation for such
vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed or
such other restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the public
peace, property, health and safety. The Manager may require the posting of bond
or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or road
structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Manager shall charge ten dollars
($10.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the Police
Division in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay
the sum of twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks -
gross weight 3 tons” or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Manager shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit.  Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.

probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

   (b)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (a)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes

Municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this Municipality.
   (c)   (1)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this Municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. 
Where the boundary between this Municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,

the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.

under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (g)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (h)   For purposes of division (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of

the offense either by an aggrieved person or by the aggrieved person's legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.
      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)

         A.   “Offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant.” The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of Ohio
R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43

involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.

investigation of the commission of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03
is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and
if the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined
to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time
of the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused departed this
Municipality or conceals the accused's identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused's purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.

Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section apply to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015,
and apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to July
16, 2015, if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section
as it existed on July 15, 2015.
(R.C. § 2901.13)
606.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in Ohio R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.”  Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.”  Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.”  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.”  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.09   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.10   FALSIFICATION.

following applies:

commission of a theft offense.

handgun license or is made in an affidavit submitted to a county sheriff to
obtain a concealed handgun license on a temporary emergency basis under Ohio
R.C. 2923.1213.

with the person’s purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery

   (c)   No person, in an attempt to obtain a concealed handgun license under

basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,

from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,

analyst appointed by the court.  Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion

the accused person, or the accused's attorney.  In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused's privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

or faculty member of the school, university, college or other educational
institution who knew or reasonably should have known of the hazing and who did

other educational institution that employed the administrator, employee or
faculty member may also be held liable.

any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of

of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14

more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or

violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.

property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, “fair
market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.

value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.

describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sado-
masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value for juveniles.
   (b)   “Juvenile.”  Any unmarried person under 18 years of age.

discernibly turgid state.
   (h)   “Obscene.”  When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to
ordinary adults or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest.
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting

      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality.
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way that
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral, or artistic
purpose.
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

698.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Dangerous offender” means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   “Repeat offender” means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the Municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
666.99 or
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) or (b)
(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant
to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C.  307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the
conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d).  Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division.  Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         C.   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor of
the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or fourth
degree;
         D.   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         E.   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         F.   A term of basic probation supervision;
         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C.  2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim’s economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on
restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of
restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the
victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division  (d),
(e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to
the Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by Ohio R.C.
111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor.  A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(ORC 2929.28)
698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04   ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05   MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or  sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States.  Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131.  When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

698.06   MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S:  Section
698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004-A updating and revision of these
Codified Ordinances because substantially equivalent State law (Ohio R.C.

698.07   SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.

   (a)   Not sooner than 45 nor later than 60 days after the end of each
calendar quarter, a video service provider shall pay a video service provider
fee to the City. The fee shall be calculated quarterly by determining the
provider’s gross revenue for the preceding calendar quarter as described in
division (b) of this section and  multiplying the result by the percentage
specified in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (b)   Gross revenue shall be computed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
      (1)   Gross revenue shall consist of all of the following revenue for the

its subscribers having service addresses within the City:

means the net revenue received by the video service provider for advertising on
its subscription-based video service within the City. If such revenue is

by multiplying the total net revenue received by the video service provider
under the contract or arrangement by the percentage resulting from dividing the
number of subscribers in the City by the total number of regional or national
subscribers that potentially receive the advertising under the contract or
arrangement.
      (2)   Gross revenue shall not include any of the following:
         A.   Any taxes, fees, or assessments that are collected by the video

provider fee authorized under this section, the fee authorized under Ohio R.C.
1332.30(F), and the Federal Communication Commission user fee;
         B.   Uncollectible charges, except that uncollectible charges, all or
part of which are written off as bad debt but subsequently collected, less the
expenses of their collection shall be included in gross revenue in the quarter
collected;
         C.   Late payment charges;
         D.   Maintenance charges;
         E.   Charges for services other than video service, reasonably
identifiable on books or records the video service provider keeps in  the
regular course of business, or by other reasonable means, that are aggregated
or bundled with amounts billed to video service subscribers, including, but not
limited to any revenue received by a video service provider or its affiliates
for telecommunications service, information service, or the provision of
directory or internet advertising, including yellow pages, white pages, banner
advertising, and electronic publishing;
         F.   Reimbursement by programmers of marketing costs actually incurred
by the video service provider;
         G.   Any revenue not expressly enumerated in division (b)(1) of this
section.
   (c)   (1)   If in a calendar quarter a franchise fee is payable by a
provider under a franchise in effect in the City, the percentage of gross
revenue payable in that calendar quarter by the video service provider to the
City shall be the same percentage of gross revenue payable in that calendar
quarter pursuant to that franchise, not to exceed 5%.
      (2)   Otherwise, the percentage shall be 5% of a video service provider’s
gross revenues, as calculated in accordance with this chapter.
   (d)   A video service provider that pays a video service provider fee
pursuant to this section may identify and collect the amount of that fee as a
separate line item on the regular bill of each of its video service subscribers
that has a service address within any portion of the City.
   (e)   (1)   At its sole expense and not more often than once per calendar
year, the City or its designee may conduct an audit for the purpose of
verifying the accuracy of a video service provider’s calculation of the video
service provider fees it paid to City in the audit period. For the purpose of
the audit, the video service provider shall make available for inspection, at
the location where such records are kept in the normal course of business,
those records pertaining to its gross  revenue as defined in 842.02(b).
      (2)   A video service provider shall pay any amounts found to have been
underpaid in the audit within 30 days after notice and shall include interest
on the underpayments. However, payment need not be made in that 30-day period
if the video service provider brings an action under division (e)(3) of this
section.
      (3)   An action by the City or by the video service provider to dispute
the amount of video service provider fee due based on the audit results may be
brought in a court of competent jurisdiction not later than two years following
the end of the quarter to which the disputed amount relates.

interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination

therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the
claim is founded, is filed with the Director of Finance within three years of

Finance.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take as a credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received, when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Director of Finance that the person from whom the tax has
been collected was not a transient guest, provided, however, that neither a
refund nor a credit shall be allowed, unless the amount of the tax so collected

portion of its total business, the Superintendent may require such additional

office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, he or she shall make
such allocation as he or she deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper
allocation of net profits to the City.  (Ord. 30-70.  Passed 7-13-70; Ord. 9-

the City in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the City.

to be included on the same return, the net loss of one unincorporated business
activity may be used to offset the profits of another (except any portion of a
loss or profit separately reportable for municipal tax purposes to another
taxing entity) for purposes of arriving at overall net operating profit or net
operating loss.
   (d)   Losses from other sources, including net operating losses and passive
activity losses reported for federal income tax purposes, may not be combined
with qualifying wages.
   (e)   The only expenses that can be deducted against qualifying wages are
those employee business expenses deductible for federal income tax purposes in
determining adjusted gross income, unless otherwise allowed on a uniform and
consistent basis by the Tax Administrator. The total of such expenses cannot
exceed the employee’s related W-2 wage income from the same employer. If a
taxpayer’s taxable income for a taxable year includes income against which the
taxpayer has taken a deduction for federal income tax purposes and reported on
Form 2106 as attached to the taxpayer’s federal income tax return filed for the
taxable year, the taxpayer shall determine taxable income to the City by
deducting the same amount deducted for federal income tax purposes and reported
on the taxpayer’s Form 2106 for that taxable year. This deduction shall be
allowed for City income tax purposes only if the taxpayer attaches to the
taxpayer’s city income tax return a copy of Form 2106 and Schedule A as filed
with the taxpayer’s federal income tax return for that taxable year.

   (a)   Each employer shall, at the time of the payment of any salary, wage,
commission or other compensation, deduct the tax of one and three-quarters
percent, beginning October 1, 1981, from the gross salaries, wages, commissions
or other compensation due by the employer to his or her employees who are
subject to the provisions of this chapter.  In making such deduction at the
time of payment, the employer shall compute the tax to the nearest full cent so
that mills of five or more shall be dropped.  No person shall be entitled to a
refund merely because such rounding off of the tax results in an apparent
overpayment based on his or her total earnings.  Each employer shall, on or
before the last day of each month following the calendar quarters ending March
31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, file a return and pay to the
Superintendent the tax withheld during the preceding calendar quarter.  Such
approval for quarterly filings and payments may be withdrawn by the
Superintendent when it is in the best interests of the City to do so.
(Ord. 12-96.  Passed 12-16-96.)
   (b)   The employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax has in fact been withheld.
   (c)   Each employer, in collecting the tax, shall be deemed to hold the same
until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for the
benefit of the City, and any such tax collected by such employer from his or
her employees shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund
in the hands of such employer.
   (d)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him or her exclusively in or
about such person’s residence, though such residence is in the City, but such
employee shall be subject to all of the requirements of this chapter.
   (e)   On or before February 28 of each year beginning with the year 1971,
each employer shall file a withholding return on a form prescribed by and
obtainable upon request from the Superintendent, setting forth the names and
addresses of all employees from whose compensation the tax was withheld during
the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld from his or her
employees and such other information as may be required by the rules and
regulations adopted by the Superintendent.  (Ord. 30-70.  Passed 7-13-70; Ord.
9-04.  Passed 7-19-04.)
   (f)   The Superintendent, for good cause, may require monthly or immediate
returns and payments to be submitted to his or her office, or may grant
requests for monthly returns and payments to be submitted.  Any employer that
withholds tax of more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) on a monthly basis is
required to file a return and remit payment on a monthly basis. For those
employers required to file monthly withholding returns, the due date of the
return shall be the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which the
tax is withheld.
   (g)   Any person required by the Internal Revenue Code to report, on an
Internal Revenue Service Form 1099, payments made by such person to any
individual not treated by such person as an employee for services performed by
such individual shall also report such payment to the City where such services
or any portion thereof were performed in the City, or where such payee is a
resident of the City. Such report shall be made on a form prescribed by the Tax
Administrator, which form shall include the name, address, federal taxpayer
identification number, the amount of the payments made to each payee, and the
percentage of such payments attributable to the City. Federal forms 1099 may be
submitted in lieu of such report. Such return or forms shall be filed annually
on or before February 28 of each year.
   (h)   Any person who is required herein to withhold City income tax from
compensation shall pay all such City income tax to the City in accordance with
the provisions of this Chapter. In the event the City income tax required to be
withheld from the compensation of employees are not so withheld or are not paid
to the city in accordance with the provisions of this section, any person,
including but not limited to all shareholders, officers, owners, managers,
employees, and trustees, having control or supervision of or charged with the
responsibility of filing the withholding return and making payment of City
income tax withheld are jointly and severally personally liable for the City
income tax withheld, not returned, or not paid to the City as well as any
related interest and penalties, and are also criminally liable under the
provisions of Section
880.99. The liquidation, dissolution, termination, death, or bankruptcy of any
person does not discharge such person’s liability for a failure of such person
to file withholding returns or withhold or pay City income taxes required to be
withheld.

880.10   DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Every person who anticipates the receipt of any taxable income which
is not subject to Section
880.09, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
subject to the tax imposed by Section
880.03, shall file a declaration setting forth such person’s estimated taxable
income, together with any estimated tax due thereon, if any, provided, however,
that if a person’s income is wholly from wages from which the tax will be
withheld and remitted to the City in accordance with Section
880.09, such person need not file a declaration.
   (b)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 30 of each year
during the life of this chapter, or within four months after the date the
taxpayer becomes subject to the provisions of this chapter.
   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal-year basis shall file a declaration
within four months after the beginning of each fiscal year or period.
(Ord. 30-70.  Passed 7-13-70.)
   (c)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by or obtainable
upon request from the Superintendent, provided, however, that credit shall be
taken for the City tax to be withheld from any portion of such income to
determine the estimated tax due.
   In accordance with the provisions of Section
880.18, credit may be taken for tax to be paid to, or to be withheld and
remitted to, another taxing municipality.
   The original declaration, or any subsequent amendment thereof, may be
amended at any time.
   An amended declaration must be filed on or before January 31 of the
following year, or, in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal year basis, on or
before the date fixed by regulation of the Superintendent if it appears that
the original declaration made for such taxable year underestimated the
taxpayer’s income by ten percent or more.  At such time, a payment which,
together with prior payments, is sufficient to pay the taxpayer’s entire
estimated liability, shall be made.  If, upon the filing of the return required
by Section
880.08, it appears that the taxpayer did not pay ninety percent of his or her
tax liability, as shown on the return, on or before January 31, or the date
fixed by regulations, whichever is applicable, the difference between ninety
percent of the taxpayer’s liability and the amount of estimated tax actually
paid on or before January 31, or the date fixed by regulation, whichever is
applicable, shall be subject to the interest and penalty provisions of Section
880.13.
   (d)   Such declaration of net estimated tax to be paid the City shall be
accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the estimated annual tax,
less credit, and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the last
day of the seventh and tenth months after the beginning of the taxable year and
the first month of the next tax year.
   (e)   On or before the fifteenth of the fourth month of the calendar or
fiscal year following that for which such declaration or amended declaration
was filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the
City shall be paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
880.08.  If the tax return is filed and paid within forty-five days after the
end of the tax year, the fourth quarter estimated tax payment may be
eliminated.
(Ord. 12-96.  Passed 12-16-96; Ord. 12-10.  Passed 7-19-10.)
880.11   DUTIES AND POWERS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

   The Superintendent shall enforce payment of all taxes owed to the City, keep
accurate records for a minimum of five years showing the amount due from each
taxpayer required to file a declaration and/or make any return, including taxes
withheld, and show the dates and amounts of payments thereof.
   (b)   The Superintendent is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of
Council by motion, to adopt, promulgate and enforce rules and regulations
relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection of taxes and the
administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including
provisions for the re-examination and correction of returns.
   (c)   In any case where a taxpayer or employer has failed to file a return
or has filed a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the
Superintendent may assess the amount of tax appearing to be due, together with
interest and penalties thereon, if any, in the following manner:
      (1)   Provisions affecting taxpayers generally.
         A.   If the Superintendent determines that any taxpayer subject to the
provisions of this chapter has a tax liability for which he or she has filed no
return or has filed an incorrect return and has failed to pay the full amount
of tax due, the Superintendent shall issue a proposed assessment showing the
amount of tax due, together with any penalty and interest that may have accrued
thereon.
            1.   Such proposed assessment shall be served upon the taxpayer in
person or by mailing it to his or her last known address by regular mail.
            2.   A taxpayer may, within fifteen days after the date the
proposed assessment was served or mailed, file a written protest with the
Superintendent.  Within fifteen days after receipt of the protest, the
Superintendent shall give the protestant an opportunity to be heard, although
the Superintendent may extend the date of hearing for good cause shown.  After
the hearing the Superintendent shall withdraw the assessment or he or she shall
adjust or reaffirm the assessment, and it shall then become final.  If no
protest if filed as herein provided, such proposed assessment shall become
final fifteen days after being served.
         B.   After a proposed assessment becomes final, notice of such final
assessment shall be issued and shall be served in the same manner as a proposed
assessment.
            1.   A taxpayer shall have thirty days after the date the final
assessment was served or mailed within which to file written notice of appeal
with the Board of Tax Appeals.  Such written notice of appeal shall be filed in
a sealed envelope plainly marked “Appeal to Board of Tax Appeals” and mailed or
delivered to the Superintendent, who shall, within five days after receipt
thereof, deliver such appeal to the Chairperson of the Board of Tax Appeals,
or, if the Chairperson is not available, to the Vice- Chairperson.
            2.   The Board of Tax Appeals, upon receipt of a notice of appeal,
shall, within fifteen days, notify the Superintendent thereof, who shall
forward to the Board, within fifteen days, a certified transcript of all
actions taken by him or her with respect to such final assessment.  Such
transcript shall be open to inspection by the appellant and his or her counsel.
            3.   Any taxpayer against whom a final assessment has been issued
and who has filed a notice of appeal shall be granted a hearing by the Board of
Tax Appeals.  At such hearing the appellant and the Superintendent shall be
given opportunity to present evidence relating to the final assessment.  After
the conclusion of such hearing, the Board of Tax Appeals shall affirm, reverse
or modify the final assessment and shall furnish a copy of its decision with
respect thereto to the appellant and the Superintendent.  The appellant’s copy
of the decision shall be served upon him or her in the same manner as herein
provided for the serving of assessments.
         C.   When any taxpayer subject to the provisions of this chapter has
filed a return indicating the amount of tax due and has failed to pay the tax
to the Superintendent as required by this chapter, the Superintendent need not
issue an assessment but may proceed under the provisions of Sections
880.14 and
880.15.
      (2)   Provisions affecting employers.
         A.   If the Superintendent determines that an employer subject to the
provisions of this chapter has failed to file a return for tax withheld and has
failed to pay to the Superintendent the full amount of such taxes, the
Superintendent shall issue a proposed assessment showing the amount of tax due,
together with any penalties and interest that may have accrued thereon, and the
provisions of paragraphs (c)(1)A. and (c)(1)B. hereof shall then apply.
         B.   If the Superintendent determines that an employer subject to the
provisions of this chapter has failed to withhold tax, the Superintendent shall
issue a proposed assessment showing the tax due, together with any penalties
and interest that may have accrued thereon, and the provisions of paragraphs
(c)(1)A. and (c)(1)B. hereof shall then apply.
         C.   When an employer subject to the provisions of this chapter has
filed a return indicating the amount of tax withheld and has failed to pay the
tax to the Superintendent as required by this chapter, the Superintendent may
proceed under the provisions of Sections
880.14 and
880.15 and need not issue an assessment as provided in paragraphs (c)(2)A. and
(c)(2)B. hereof.
   (d)   Any taxpayer or employer who has not filed a notice of appeal to the
Board of Tax Appeals from a final assessment issued against him or her shall
pay the amount thereof within fifteen days after service of such final
assessment. The amount of the final assessment may not be appealed.
   Any taxpayer or employer who has filed a notice of appeal to the Board of
Tax Appeals from a final assessment issued against him or her shall pay the
amount determined to be due by the Board of Tax Appeals within fifteen days
after service of his or her copy of the decision of the Board.
   (e)   The Superintendent shall have the authority, when requested by the
taxpayer and for good cause shown, to extend the time of making and filing any
return whenever he or she deems it necessary to do so, but not to exceed a
period of six months, or one month beyond any extension requested of or granted
by the Internal Revenue Service for the filing of the Federal Income Tax
Return.
   (f)   When an application for deferred payment of tax due is filed by a
taxpayer, the Superintendent may authorize partial payments of unpaid taxes
when, in his or her judgment, the taxpayer is unable, due to hardship
conditions, to pay the full amount of the tax when due, and when, in his or her
judgment, such deferred payments are the best means of accomplishing the intent
of this chapter.  However, the Superintendent shall not authorize an extension
of time for the payment of such taxes due for more than twelve months beyond
the date of the filing of the application.
   (g)   The Superintendent shall have the authority to charge a fee for any
payment made by check under this
Chapter 880, which has been returned “unpaid” due to insufficient funds. Said
fee shall be reasonably calculated in an amount necessary to cover the City’s
expenses for processing and handling fees assessed to the City and for the
check returned “unpaid” for insufficient funds. The Superintendent shall not
charge this fee unless and until the amount of said fee is posted in writing
and available to the public.

Income Tax Returns, the refusal to submit to such examination by any employer
or person subject or presumed to be subject to the tax, or by any officer,
agent or employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax,
or the failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section or
with an order or subpoena of the Superintendent authorized hereby, shall be
deemed a violation of this chapter, punishable as provided in Section
880.99.
   (d)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person’s official duties or the official business of the City or as
authorized by this chapter or the charter or ordinance authorizing the levy.
The Superintendent may furnish copies of returns filed under this chapter to
the internal revenue service and to the Tax Commissioner. Any person divulging

six months, or both. Each disclosure shall constitute a separate offense.

after final determination of the Federal tax liability.
   (d)   Upon recommendation of the Superintendent, the Board of Adjudication
may abate penalty or interest, or both.

the tax evaded, not withheld or not paid over.  No other penalty under this
section shall be applied to any offense to which this penalty is applied.

885.01   AUTHORITY TO LEVY TAX; PURPOSES OF TAX; RATE.
   (a)   Authority to levy tax.
      (1)   The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this
Chapter 885 are authorized by Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio
Constitution.  The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this
Chapter 885 are deemed to be levied in accordance with, and to be consistent
with, the provisions and limitations of Ohio R.C. 718.  This chapter is deemed
to incorporate the provisions of ORC 718.
      (2)   The tax is an annual tax levied on the income of every person
residing in or earning or receiving income in the municipal corporation, and
shall be measured by municipal taxable income.    The Municipality shall tax
income at a uniform rate.  The tax is levied on Municipal Taxable Income, as
defined herein.  (ORC 718.04)
   (b)   Purposes of tax; rate. For the purpose of providing funds for the
purpose of general municipal operations, which includes police, maintenance,
repair and upgrading of existing streets, new equipment, extension and
enlargement of Municipal services and facilities and capital improvements of
the city there is hereby levied a tax at the rate of 2.25% per annum.  (ORC
718.04)
   (c)   Allocation of funds.
      (1)   Effective January 1, 2016, from all municipal income tax receipts
received by the city, the following allocation is hereby to be made to the
General Fund:  100%.
      (2)   The Director of Finance is hereby authorized and directed to take
all necessary action in order to carry out the allocation provided for in
subsection (c)(1) hereof.
   (d)   Statement of procedural history; state mandated changes to municipal
income tax.
      (1)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to ORC 718 were enacted by
Am Sub H.B. 5 (H.B. 5), passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by
Governor Kasich on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal
corporations to conform to and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have
the authority to impose, enforce, administer and collect a municipal income
tax.
      (2)   As mandated by H.B. 5, City of Centerville Ordinance 19-15,
(Ordinance 19-15) effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends
Chapter 880 in accordance with the provisions of ORC 718 to allow the
municipality to continue the income tax and withholding tax administration and
collection efforts on behalf of the municipality.
(Ord. 19-15.  Passed 11-16-15; Ord. 11-16.  Passed 6-20-16.)
885.02   EFFECTIVE DATE.
   (a)   Ordinance 19-15, effective January 1, 2016, and corresponding changes
to Ohio R.C. 718, apply to municipal taxable years beginning on or after
January 1, 2016.  All provisions of this
Chapter 885 apply to taxable years beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.
   (b)   Ordinance 19-15 does not repeal the existing sections of
Chapter 880 for any taxable year prior to 2016, but rather amends
Chapter 880 effective January 1, 2016.  For municipal taxable years beginning
before January 1, 2016, the Municipality shall continue to administer, audit,
and enforce the income tax of the Municipality under ORC 718 and ordinances and
resolutions of the Municipality as that chapter and those ordinances and
resolutions existed before January 1, 2016.

15.  Passed 11-16-15.)
885.03   DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Ohio R.C. Title LVII and the use is not consistent, then the use of the
term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall
control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code.
   For purposes of this section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Adjusted federal taxable income,” for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division (w)(4) of this section, means a C corporation’s federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division  (a)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition
of property described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(4)B. of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         B.   Division (a)(4)A. of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;

computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under Ohio R.C.
4313.02;
      (8)   A.   Except as limited by divisions (a)(8)B., C. and D. of this
section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable year
beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
         B.   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (a)(8) of
this section to offset qualifying wages.
         C.   i.   For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, or
2022, a person may not deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a
municipal corporation that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, more
than 50% of the amount of the deduction otherwise allowed by division (a)(8)A.
of this section.
            ii.   For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person
may deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a municipal corporation

division (a)(8)A. of this section.
         D.   Any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward deduction that is
available must be utilized before a taxpayer may deduct any amount pursuant to
division (a)(8) of this section.
         E.   Nothing in division (a)(8)C.i. of this section precludes a person
from carrying forward, for use with respect to any return filed for a taxable
year beginning after 2018, any amount of net operating loss that was not fully
utilized by operation of division (a)(8)C.i. of this section.  To the extent
that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in one or more
taxable years by operation of division (A)(8)C.i. of this section is carried
forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable year beginning in
2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in division (A)(8)C.i. of
this section shall apply to the amount carried forward.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer’s federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group’s federal taxable income in accordance with section
885.06(c)(5)C.ii. of this chapter.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer’s federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group’s federal taxable income in accordance with section
885.06(c)(5)C.ii. of this chapter.

adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.

federal self-employment tax.

taxpayer to which whenever absent, the taxpayer intends to return.
         B.   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Municipality for

Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if
the tax administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
         C.   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (b)(1)A. of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
municipality  for all or part of the taxable year.
      (2)   For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled
in the Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:

period” with the municipality if the individual is away overnight from the
individual’s abode located outside of the municipality and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the municipality.  For purposes of this section, the
state’s contact period test or bright-line test and resulting determination
have no bearing on municipal residency or domicile.

885.05   COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Collection at source; withholding from qualifying wages.
      (1)   A.    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located
or doing business in the municipality shall withhold from each employee an
amount equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in
the municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the municipality’s income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
section
885.05(b) of this chapter or division (a)(4) or (5) of this section.  An
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the
tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer
directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or
credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
         B.   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division
(a)(1)A. of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may
also deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the
municipal corporation in which the employee is a resident.
      (2)   A.   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit
to the Tax Administrator of the municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
            i.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (a)(2)A.ii. of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the last day
of each calendar quarter.
            ii.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payments under division (a)(2)A.ii. of this section shall be
made by to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day
of each month.
            iii.   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required
to make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all
taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the
municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer’s, agent’s, or other payer’s obligation to file any return as
required under this section.  Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the municipality
shall be remitted to the municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator.  A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee’s employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section
885.09(a) of this chapter.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual’s disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation’s
successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer’s, agent’s, or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator
listing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from
whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee’s qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer’s employees and
constituting qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities
are under the employer’s control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or
gratuity is under the employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the
customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the
customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other
electronic means.
      (11)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

or controlled by an employer.
         F.   “Worksite location” means a construction site or other temporary

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee’s qualifying wages
subject to division (b)(2)A.i. of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee’s “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (b)(2)B. of this
section, except that “location” shall be substituted for “municipal
corporation” wherever “municipal corporation” appears in that division.
      (2)   A.   Subject to divisions (b)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in a municipal corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed

calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            i.   The employee’s principal place of work is located in the

more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee’s qualifying wages
as provided in section
885.05(a) of this chapter.

entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee’s capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the municipality.
         B.   For the purposes of division (b)(2)A. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a
municipal corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any
other municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the
amount of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent
performing one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have
been spent at the employee’s principal place of work:
            i.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            ii.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            iii.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee’s employer;
            iv.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (b)
(2)B.iii. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee’s employer;
            v.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee’s final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee’s
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee’s
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee’s principal place of work is located.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (b)(2)A. of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (b)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax
for that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer
paid qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
         C.   If an employer makes the election described in division (b)(4)B.
of this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee’s
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
      (5)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee’s qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer’s fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in section
885.03 of this chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer’s federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (b)(2)A. and (b)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
885.05(a) of this chapter.

deducted and withheld.
         E.   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

required amount from a person’s winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
      (4)   If a person’s prize award from a video lottery terminal is an
amount for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by
section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales

lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
         C.   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (c)(5) of this section and shall make those

shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
         F.   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

      (6)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video

personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (7)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold
the required amount from a person’s prize award does not relieve that person
from liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.

fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

amount is deducted and withheld.
      (10)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts
and returns required under this section.

the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         A.   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative

         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

885.19(a) of this chapter.
         C.   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(2)A. of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by section

         D.   Nothing in division (b)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax

taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (b)(1)B. of this section, “wages, salaries, and

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (b)(3)A. or B. of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.

from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall

            i.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
            ii.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation

sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
            iii.   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
         B.   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
         C.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
         D.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
         E.   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal
corporation in which the property generating the net profit is located and the
municipal corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net
profit resides.

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(6)B. of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located.  Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual’s net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual’s annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under section
885.08(a) of this chapter.
      (7)   If, in computing a taxpayer’s adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee’s
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under sections
885.03(k)(12) and
885.03(hh)(1)D. this chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer
has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount
that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned
to that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add
to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
      (8)   When calculating the ratios described in division (b)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (b)(2) of this section,

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
            i.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
            ii.   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent

The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
         B.   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the

         C.   An election made under division (c)(2)A. or B. of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm’s length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.

income” for “federal taxable income” wherever “federal taxable income” appears
in that division and by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation’s” for
“a C corporation’s” wherever “a C corporation’s” appears in that division.
         B.   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under section
885.03(a) of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
         C.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
            i.   Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
885.06(b) of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
            ii.   Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the

the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity’s net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         D.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
            i.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in section
885.06(b) of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
            ii.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make the computations required under section
885.06(b) of this chapter by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to” for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in
that section and by substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for
“taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with
this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation

such an affiliated group.
      (8)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit
against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
municipality.  If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years.
Before the municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of

(ORC 718.15) 
   (e)   Tax credits to foster job retention. The municipality, by ordinance,

the taxpayer, and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years. Before the
municipality passes an ordinance allowing such a credit, the municipality and
the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of the
credit.

the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds

month of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for
the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be

provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year

         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the

D. of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year

885.09(a) of this chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and  are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return
is due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless
extended pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G).
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer’s
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year.  A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.

of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall

tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under section
885.09(a) of this chapter for that year.
      (3)   The  taxpayer  is  an  individual  who  resides  in  the
Municipality  but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the

of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

885.08   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   (a)   Credit for tax paid to another municipality.
      (1)   Where a resident of the Municipality is subject to a municipal
income tax in another municipal corporation, the resident shall not pay a total
municipal income tax on the same income greater than the tax imposed at the
highest rate to which the resident is subject.
      (2)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the municipality who
receives net profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service
compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside the
municipality, if it is made to appear that the taxpayer has paid a municipal
income tax on the same income taxable under this chapter to another
municipality, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter
of the amount so paid by the taxpayer or on the taxpayer’s behalf to such other
municipal corporation. The credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this
chapter on such income earned in such other municipal corporation or municipal
corporations where such tax is paid. No credit shall be granted for county or
school district taxes paid.
   (b)   Refundable credit for qualifying loss.
      (1)   As used in this section:
         A.   “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   i.   Except as provided in division (b)(1)B.ii. of this section,
“qualifying loss” means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer’s receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
            ii.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid
to one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount
of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (b)(1)B.i. of this
section computed without regard to division (b)(1)B.ii. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            iii.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan,
the taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.    “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation
with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of
which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If
different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the “qualifying
tax rate” is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted
average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
         C.   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the

by a taxpayer who is not an individual,  no remittance is required if the
amount shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
         B.   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the municipality in accordance with
this chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and
make payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers
not otherwise required to file annual returns.
         C.   With respect to taxpayers to whom section
885.09(b) of this chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in section
885.09(b) of this chapter, the provision in section
885.09(b) of this chapter prevails.
      (8)   A.   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount

before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
“The date of postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         B.   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment.  For purposes of this
section, “submitted the payment” means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.

agent of an employer, or other payer as described in section
885.05(a) of this chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation

with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer’s refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.  Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
      (12)   The Tax Administrator of the municipality shall accept for filing
a generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
municipality’s ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
      (13)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
      (14)   A.   As used in this division, “worksite location” has the same
meaning as in section
885.05(b) of this chapter.
         B.   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
            i.   The person was required to file a tax return with the
municipal corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the
person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal
corporation, and the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and
remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this
chapter.  The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a
taxpayer who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
            ii.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation’s
income tax for the taxable year.
         The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall
include the following statement:  “The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation’s resolutions, ordinances, or rules.”  The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
            iii.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (a)
(14)B. of this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to
file any tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (a)(14) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator
from performing an audit of the person.

first day after the applicant’s active duty or service terminates.

extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used
in this section, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the national guard or
a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian

support of the armed forces.
            ii.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (b)(3)B.i. of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
      (4)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer’s requested extension.
      (4)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
      (5)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer

included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including

undocumented credits or losses.
         B.   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (f)

shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.

request included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and

of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
section
885.10(a)(4) of this chapter.
      (5)   As used in this section, “withholding tax” has the same meaning as

or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers

time.
      (1)    As used in this division (b), “claim” means a claim for an amount
payable to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax
imposed in accordance with this chapter.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the municipality:
         A.   Compromise a claim;
         B.   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator’s rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
      (4)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
      (5)    A.   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
         B.   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
      (6)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide
detailed financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether
or not a payment-over-time agreement will be authorized.  The taxpayer’s
failure to provide the necessary and required information by the Tax
Administrator shall preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(ORC 718.28)
   (c)   Authority of Tax Administrator; right to examine.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter.  Upon written request
by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator’s
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person’s
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

the request was directed pursuant to section
885.10 of this chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
885.99 of this chapter.
         B.   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (d)(1) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to section
885.10 of this chapter.
         C.   The penalties provided for under divisions (d)(2)A. and B. of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in section
885.99 of this chapter for a violation of 885.15 of this chapter and any other
penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by law.

shall access or disclose such information except in accordance with a proper
judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person’s official
duties or the official business of the Municipality or as authorized by Ohio
R.C. Ch. 718 or the charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax

   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an “opinion of the Tax Administrator” and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer’s request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the

identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator’s response is signed by the Tax Administrator

protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator’s opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer’s date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality’s
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the municipality’s income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer’s material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or

obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
885.15 of this chapter.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.

received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.

(ORC 718.38)  (Ord. 19-15.  Passed 11-16-15.)
885.17   ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person’s agent or the person’s affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee’s business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(ORC 718.18)  (Ord. 19-15.  Passed 11-16-15.)
885.18   LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.

Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Ch. 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the municipality.  Two members shall
be appointed by the legislative authority of the municipality, and  may not be
employees, elected officials, or contractors with the municipality at any time
during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official
of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of the municipality, but

Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by the
legislative authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth
in Ohio R.C. 718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member’s predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member’s
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer’s right to appeal the assessment,  the manner in which the taxpayer
may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be
directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator’s
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board’s final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board’s
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing.  Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22.  For this reason, such hearings
shall not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be
present during the hearing.

      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in section
885.18 of this chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the

the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final  determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under section
885.18 of this chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than

885.23.02   DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in R.C. Chapter 5703, in which
case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference in this
chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United States
related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this section and
section
885.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (a)   “Municipal taxable income” means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section
885.03 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (b)   “Adjusted federal taxable income,” for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of R.C. § 718.01 and section
885.03 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation’s federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income deducted under
division (b)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under R.C. § 4313.02.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (c)(5)C.ii. of
section
885.06 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group’s federal taxable income in accordance with division (c)(5)C.ii. of
section
885.06 of the Codified Ordinances.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (uu)(2) of section
885.03 of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (w)(4) of section
885.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (c)   “Taxpayer” has the same meaning as in section
885.03 of the Codified Ordinances, except that “taxpayer” does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under R.C. Chapter 5745.
“Taxpayer” may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when
such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (d)   “Tax return” or “return” means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal income
taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (e)   “Taxable year” means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
Tax Commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (f)   “Assessment” means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
885.03 of the Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 12-18.  Passed 2-19-18.)
885.23.03   APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS: APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City of Centerville and that has made the election under
Chapter 885 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City of Centerville shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the City of Centerville for purposes of  municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City of Centerville during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City of Centerville to wages, salaries, and other compensation
paid during the same period to individuals employed in the business or
profession, wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding
compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
885.05(b) of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City of
Centerville to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City of Centerville, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (a)(1)A. of
section
885.19 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by  division
(a) of section
885.19 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, “wages, salaries, and
other compensation” includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         A.   The employer;
         B.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         C.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City of

sitused to the City of Centerville only if, regardless of where title passes,
the property meets either of the following criteria:

Centerville from a stock of goods located within the City of Centerville.
         B.   The property is delivered within the City of Centerville from a
location outside the City of Centerville, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within the City of Centerville and the sales result from such solicitation or
promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City of Centerville to the extent that such services are performed in the City
of Centerville.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City of Centerville shall be sitused to the City
of Centerville.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City of Centerville shall be
sitused to the City of Centerville.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City of Centerville based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the City of Centerville.
   (e)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City of
Centerville in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the
real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the City of Centerville based
upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in the City of Centerville to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (k)(12) and (hh)(l) of section
885.03 of the Codified Ordinances by the City of Centerville or substantially
similar provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation,
the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the
taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City of Centerville. In no
case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned
to the City of Centerville any amount other than the amount upon which the
employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock
option not exempted from taxation. This division applies solely for the purpose
of making an adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to the City of Centerville under this section.
   (g)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

the taxpayer's identification number. Each return shall be verified by a
declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A.   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to include, with
each annual tax return, amended return, or request for refund filed with the
Commissioner under sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances, copies of any relevant documents or other
information.
         B.   A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically through
the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission
is not available, mail the documents to the Tax Commissioner. The department of
taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax.
   (c)   (1)   A.   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a tax return with the Commissioner under this
section. The extended due date of the return shall be the fifteenth day of the
tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         C.   An extension of time to file under division (c)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)   If the Commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with
Chapter 885 of the Codified Ordinances, the Commissioner may require taxpayers
to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this section,
including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (d)   Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section shall
include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the Commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
Commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
Commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the Commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (e)   When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the Tax Commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

885.23.06   ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (a)   All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under section 885 of
the Codified Ordinances shall file any tax return or extension for filing a tax
return, and shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such returns,
electronically, either through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner
as prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
   (b)   A taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make
payments electronically. For good cause shown, the Commissioner may excuse the
applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the returns or
make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)   The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns and
make payments by electronic means;
      (2)   The information taxpayers must submit when filing tax returns by
electronic means.
(Ord. 12-18.  Passed 2-19-18.)
885.23.07   CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Affiliated group of corporations” means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   “Consolidated federal income tax return” means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   “Consolidated federal taxable income” means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. “Consolidated
federal taxable income” does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (a)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   “Incumbent local exchange carrier” has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.
      (5)   “Local exchange telephone service” has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5727.01.
   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year.
   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section or a taxpayer
receives permission from the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner shall
approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
885.06 of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of section
885.06 of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under section
885.06 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the Tax Commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (d)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (e)(3), and
(e)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall
compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
885.03(a) of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting “consolidated federal
taxable income” for “federal taxable income” wherever “federal taxable income”
appears in that division and by substituting “an affiliated group of
corporation's” for “a C corporation's” wherever “a C corporation's” appears in
that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
885.03(a)(4) of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income
or deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following with
respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
885.06(b) of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
885.06(b) of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in section
885.06(b) of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
885.06(b) of the Codified Ordinances by substituting “consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to” for “net profit from” wherever “net profit
from” appears in that section and by substituting “affiliated group of
corporations” for “taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances or R.C. Chapter 5703 to the corporation, an
affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the
taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated group.
(Ord. 12-18.  Passed 2-19-18.)
885.23.08   FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
Chapter 885 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the date prescribed for its payment
until it is paid or until the date an assessment is issued under section
885.03 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 12-18.  Passed 2-19-18.)
885.23.09   DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Combined tax liability” means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   “Estimated taxes” means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least $200.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the Commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors,
   (c)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (c)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 67.5% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, 90% of the combined tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   A.   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         B.   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of R.C. § 718.85.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
R.C. § 5703.47 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,
unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e)
of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with R.C. § 718.83.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal income tax return
for that year.
(Ord. 12-18.  Passed 2-19-18.)
885.23.10   ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances or R.C. Chapter 5703, the following penalties
shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the Tax
Commissioner, the Commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding $25 per month
or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between
the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on which the
return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division shall
not exceed $150.
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the Commissioner may impose a
penalty not to exceed the following:
         A.   For each of the first two failures, 5% of the amount required to
be reported on the return;
         B.   For the third and any subsequent failure, 10% of the amount
required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
Chapter 885 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax
required to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty
equal to 15% of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to $500 may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of $1,000 or 100% of the tax required to be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Chapter 885 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding
the greater of  $1,000 or 100% of the claim. Any penalty imposed under this
division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from the
date of the refund, may be assessed under section
885.03 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (a) of that section.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (c)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The Commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (d)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under R.C. §
718.83.
(Ord. 12-18.  Passed 2-19-18.)
885.23.11   ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in
Chapter 885 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall
be no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that falls to file a
return subject to assessment as required by sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
Commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in R.C. § 5703.37. With the notice, the Commissioner shall provide
instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the
petition.
   (b)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Commissioner shall proceed under R.C. §
5703.60.
   (c)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax
Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin County.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled “special judgments for
municipal income taxes,” and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from
the day the Commissioner issues the assessment until the assessment is paid or
until it is certified to the attorney general for collection under R.C. §
131.02, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is
certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire unpaid portion of
the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (d)   All money collected under this section shail be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (e)   If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (c) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in R.C. § 5703.37
within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk. The total amount
assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed files a
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of this section and
provides security in a form satisfactory to the Commissioner and in an amount
sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial
payment of the assessment does not prejudice the Commissioner's consideration
of the petition for reassessment.
   (f)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by
Chapter 885 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as
provided by that section.
(Ord. 12-18.  Passed 2-19-18.)
885.23.12   REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the Tax Commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by section
885.09(f)(3) of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the
form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
   (b)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment, if the amount is greater than $10 and not less than that claimed,
the Commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget and
management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in R.C. § 5703.052. If the amount is greater than $10 but less than
that claimed, the Commissioner shall proceed in accordance with R.C. § 5703.70.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under R.C. § 718.83.

885.23.13   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
Chapter 885 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Tax Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the Commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (b)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
885.03 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (c)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
885.09 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in section
885.09 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
885.23.14   EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (a)   The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the Commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
885.01 to
885.99 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the Tax Commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
Commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control.
   The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant,
bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This
division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an
attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

   No person, firm or corporation shall do, or permit to be done by his, her or
its agents, servants or employees, any of the following acts without having
first obtained a permit therefor from the Manager:
   (a)   Make any excavation or dig into any street, sidewalk, alley or other
public way or public place in any manner or direction;
   (b)   Install, place or join together any pipes or conduits of any kind for
the conduct of water, gas, electricity, drainage or seepage, or for any other
purpose whatsoever, upon or beneath the surface of a street, sidewalk, alley,
public way or public place.
(Ord. 13-59.  Passed 9-1-59.)
1024.02   PERMIT APPLICATION; FEE; DEPOSIT.
   A person, firm or corporation desiring to acquire a permit to do any of the
acts specified in Section
1024.01 shall apply to the City Engineer.  Before the City Engineer shall issue
such permit, the applicant shall pay a permit fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) to
cover necessary administrative and engineering expenses and deposit the sum of
five hundred dollars ($500.00), or a sum computed at the rate of fifty dollars
($50.00) per square yard proposed by the applicant to be excavated, whichever
sum is greater.  The permit fee and the deposit so required shall be paid in
cash, certified check or postal money order to the Finance Director, and
thereafter the permit shall be issued. 
(Ord. 06-17.  Passed 4-17-17.)
1024.03   TIME PERIOD AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR SURFACE RESTORATION AND
RECONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   An applicant shall be required to restore the sidewalk, public way or
alley excavated under a permit to its original pavement condition, subject to
further regulation, specifications and control by the City Engineer for such
restoration, which restoration and reconstruction shall be completed within
three days if a public way, and thirty days if otherwise, from the date of
issuance of the permit.  Upon completion as required, the applicant shall
immediately notify the City Engineer that such restoration and reconstruction
have been made.  Thereafter, the Finance Director shall retain the deposit made
upon the issuance of the permit for a period of ninety days, beginning with the
date of notification by the applicant of completion as heretofore required. 
If, at the end of the ninety-day period, the restoration and reconstruction in
connection with such excavation are finally approved upon inspection by the
appointed authority, then the deposit as hereinbefore required shall be
returned to the grantee of the permit.  If the restoration and reconstruction
are not approved and are adjudged to be unsatisfactory by the City Engineer,
upon inspection, then the City Engineer shall expend such amounts out of the
sum so deposited to complete the restoration and reconstruction in accordance
with the standards and specifications provided in this chapter and the
Subdivision Regulations, except as may otherwise be provided in the Zoning
Code, and the balance remaining after such expenditure shall then be returned
to the grantee of the permit. The purpose of the additional ninety-day period
is to provide a period for proving the reconstruction by the grantee of the
permit against settling or faulty workmanship.  If the grantee of the permit
fails to complete the restoration and reconstruction of the excavated portion
within the period provided for herein, then the deposit shall be forfeited to
the City, unless the City Engineer extends the period for good cause shown.
   (b)   Restoration of asphalt public ways shall be accomplished in the
following manner:
      (1)   Edges of the cut through existing asphalt shall be made with an
air- driven jack-hammer chisel or other tool to make a neat, straight edge. The
final cut shall be sixteen inches wider than the utility ditch.
         (2)   The entire cut will be backfilled with 46D, or pit-run gravel,
damp, applied in six-inch layers, each layer compacted with an air-driven tamp
or twenty-pound hand-tamp to an elevation not higher than eight inches below
the original street surface.
         (3)   A subcap of Class A, six and one-half bag concrete, six inches
thick, shall be applied over the fill.  The concrete shall be not less than one
foot wider than the cut (six inches on each side).
         (4)   The surface of the concrete and edges of the cut shall be coated
with asphaltic tac-coat at the rate of .2 gallon per square yard.
         (5)   The remaining depth of not less than two inches shall be filled
with hot T-35, compacted to the original elevation and grade of the street. 
This asphalt cap shall be four inches wider than the concrete slab (two inches
on each side).
         (6)   The completed joint between old and new will be coated with
asphaltic seal, RC-2 or equivalent, or heat sealed with a suitable flame.
   (c)   Cuts into concrete streets shall be restored in the same manner,
except that there will be only a six-inch concrete cap.

privilege granted by such permit, to reimburse the City for any expenses
incurred by it by reason thereof, and to defend any such claim, demand, lawsuit
or judgment.

procured and is keeping in full force and effect a policy of liability
insurance providing the grantee and the City with indemnification against any
claim, demand, law suit or judgment arising out of any exercise of the
privilege granted by such permit, and providing for the defense on behalf of
the City against any such claim, demand, law suit or judgment.  The
requirements of this section may be waived when, in the opinion of the Manager,
the nature of the undertaking does not require it.

1024.06   PUBLIC UTILITY EMERGENCIES.

service from an unknown cause in any public utility line lying in the City, a
public utility firm or corporation operating under a franchise with the City,
and under authority of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, shall not be
required to first  obtain a permit to make a lawful excavation, but may, in
order to repair the line which may require emergency attention, immediately
make such excavation.  The firm or corporation shall then take all steps
necessary to continue complete and adequate service to the property owners of
the City. As soon as practicable a permit shall be obtained for such
excavation. 
(Ord. 13-59.  Passed 9-1-59.)
1024.07   BOND IN LIEU OF DEPOSIT.

deposit.  If such contractor or public utility firm elects to be so exempted,
then it shall forthwith deposit, with the City, a performance bond in the sum
of not less than five  thousand dollars ($5,000), with a corporate surety
acceptable to the City, to ensure the restoration to its original pavement
condition of any street, sidewalk space, sidewalk, alley or public way which

   The performance bond of five thousand dollars ($5,000) set forth in Section
1024.07 shall provide that in the event a contractor or public utility firm for
any reason fails to reconstruct and restore a street, sidewalk, sidewalk space,
alley or public way within a reasonable period of time, in accordance with the
standards and specifications referred to in Section
1024.03, then the sum of the performance bond shall be forfeited and paid over
to the City.
1024.09   UTILITIES EXEMPTED FROM INSURANCE    REQUIREMENT.
   By reason of the extensive and careful supervision of public utility firms
operating under the authority of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, and
by reason of the substantial assets of such public utility firms or
corporations, the requirements of Section
1024.05 shall not apply to such public utility firms.

   (b)   Location shall be as follows:
      (1)   In accordance with R.C. § 4939.0314(D) the City shall reserve the
right to propose an alternate location to the proposed location of a new
wireless support structure, provided the alternate location is within 100 feet
or a distance equal to the width of the right-of-way in or on which the new
wireless support structure is proposed, whichever is greater. The City of
Centerville also finds that certain locations and collocation configurations
are preferred. A preferred location and collocation configuration should be
utilized whenever possible and should only be surpassed if in the determination
of the Public Works Director or the Public Works Director's designee, clear and
convincing evidence supports such a decision. Cost alone should not be grounds
for such a determination. The order of preference is as follows:
         A.   First, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such pole
or wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
         B.   Second, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless support structure within an alley. If no such pole or wireless
support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
         C.   Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
         D.   Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley. If no such location is available
then proceed to the next preference;
         E.   Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a wireless
support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located within the
City right-of-way. If no such wireless support structure is available then
proceed to the next preference;
         F.   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole located within the right-of-way. If no such existing pole is available
then proceed to the next preference;
         G.   Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within a utility easement. If no such
location is available then proceed to the next preference;
         H.   Eighth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within an alley. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
         I.   Ninth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the City right-of-way.
      (2)   Any new wireless support structure shall be located at least 1,000
feet from any existing small cell facility.
   (c)   Wireless facilities design shall be as follows:
      (1) Wireless support structures shall be subject to the following design
standards:
         A.   Wireless support structures shall be limited to forty feet in
height.
         B.   Wireless support structures shall be capable of supporting at
least two small cell facility operators.
         C.   New wireless support structures shall have the following design
elements:
            1.   Material - aluminum poles;
            2.   Color - black anodized;
            3.   Diameter - 12 inches;
            4.   Style - smooth round tapered profile;
            5.   Base - trapezoidal pedestal base on a reinforced concrete
footing/foundation pier;
            6.   Exception - If the neighborhood context would be better served
by a pole of a different material, color, style, or base as determined by the
Public Works Director or his/her designee, then such design elements may be
substituted with an alternate design element. Such determination shall be based
on the following factors:
               a.   The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
               b.   The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
               c.   The historical context of a district or specific site; and
               d.   A desire to camouflage or conceal the pole from view.
      (2)   Small cell facilities shall be subject to the following design
standards:
         A.   The City reserves the right to require the following:
            1.   Antenna and all associated equipment shall be concealed to the
extent deemed necessary by the Public Works Director in response to the
aesthetic context of the small cell facility. Some possible configurations
include but shall not be limited to the following:
               a.   Antenna(s) associated with the first fitting on a wireless
support structure shall be top-mounted and concealed within a radome that also
conceals the cable connections, antenna mount and other hardware. The Public
Works Director or the Public Works Director's designee may approve a side-
mounted antenna with the initial fitting if, in the Public Works Director or
the Public Works Director's designee's discretion, the side-mounted antenna
would be a better match to the built aesthetics and character, of the immediate
area and would promote the purposes of this Chapter.
               b.   GPS antennas be placed within the radome or directly above
the radome not to exceed six inches.
         B.   Each antenna and all associated equipment shall not exceed six
cubic feet in volume.
         C.   All portions of a small cell facility other than an antenna and
as identified by the R.C. § 4939.01(P)(2), shall not exceed twenty-eight cubic
feet in volume per facility.
         D.   Small cell facilities mounted to a wireless support structure
shall be completely concealed within a common enclosure capable of containing
at least two small sell facilities. Such common enclosures shall:
            1.   Not exceed twenty-one cubic feet in volume;
            2.   Not exceed ninety inches in height, twenty inches in width, or
twenty inches in depth;
            3.   Not extend more than twenty-four inches away from the pole on
which it is mounted;
            4.   Shall be centered on the vertical axis of the pole to which it
is mounted;
            5.   Be mounted at a distance of at least ten feet measured from
grade to the bottom of the enclosure; and
            6.   Be mounted on the side of the pole facing away from nearest
traffic lane's direction of travel.
         E.   Such common enclosures shall have the following design elements:
            1.   Material.  The enclosure material shall be metal, a composite,
or an equivalent material as determined by the Public Works Director or the
Public Works Director designee.
            2.   Color. The enclosure shall match the color of the pole on
which it is mounted.
            3.   Style. The enclosure shall match the style of the pole on
which it is mounted.
            4.   Coordinated design elements. Common enclosures shall match the
material, color, and style of nearby existing common enclosures when:
               a.   Such enclosures are located within 5,000 feet of an
existing common enclosure; and
               b.   Such enclosures are mounted on wireless support structures
of a similar or matching design.
            5.   Exception. If the aesthetics and character of the immediate
area are better matched by an enclosure of a different materials, color, style,
or by deviating from the design of a nearby existing common enclosure, as
determined by the Public Works Director or his/her designee, then such design
elements may be substitutes with an alternate design element. Such
determination shall be based on the following factors:
               a.   The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
               b.   The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
               c.   The historical context of a district or specific area; and
               d.   A desire to camouflage or conceal the enclosure from view.
         F.   All ground mounted equipment shall be placed in an underground
vault. No above grade ground mounted equipment in service of a small cell
facility is permitted unless the following conditions can be satisfied as
determined by the Public Works Director or the Public Works Director designee:
            1.   The applicant has submitted clear and convincing evidence that
the equipment cannot feasibly be pole-mounted, placed in an underground vault,
or hidden within or integrated into an existing streetscape element (i.e. - bus
stop shelter). Increased costs alone shall not be a consideration. If a ground
mounted enclosure is approved, the Public Works Director or the Public Works
Director designee shall reserve the right to require any of the following
conditions:
               a.   Concealed Enclosure. All equipment shall be completely
concealed within a metal, composite, or equivalent material enclosure as
determined by the Public Works Director or his/her designee.
               b.   Smallest Size. The enclosure shall be no larger than
necessary based on the smallest available size of the proposed equipment as
determined by the Public Works Director or the Public Works Director designee.
               c.   Camouflage. Camouflaging elements may be required. Such
elements may include, but shall not be limited to, public art displayed on the
enclosure, strategic placement in less visible or obtrusive locations,
placement within an existing streetscape element, landscape screening, and
strategic painting or coating to camouflage such enclosure or equipment.
            2.   The maximum height of any such enclosure shall be thirty
inches.
(Ord. 16-18.  Passed 5-21-18.)
1048.16   RESERVATION OF RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   The City reserves the right to reserve space for future public safety or
transportation uses in the right-of-way or on a wireless support structure or
pole owned or operated by the City in a documented and approved plan in place
at the time an application is filed. A reservation of space shall not preclude
placement of a pole or collocation of a small cell facility. If replacement of
the City's pole or wireless support structure is necessary to accommodate the
collocation of the small cell facility and the future use, the small cell
facility operator shall pay for the replacement of the pole or wireless support
structure, and the replaced pole or wireless support structure must accommodate
the future use.
(Ord. 16-18.  Passed 5-21-18.)
1048.17   NONCONFORMITY.

or circumstances, is held invalid, the remaining provisions, subsection, and
applications of such ordinance to other persons or circumstances shall not be
made invalid as well. It is declared to be the intent of this section that the
remaining provisions would have been adopted had such invalid provisions not
been included in this chapter when originally adopted by Council.
(Ord. 16-18.  Passed 5-21-18.)
1048.99   PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person in violation of any of the terms of this chapter, or who,

Any person owning, operating or maintaining a system without a certificate of
registration, including persons operating under a permit, license or franchise
issued by the City prior to the effective date of this chapter, shall apply for
and obtain a certificate of registration from the City within ninety days of
the effective date of this chapter unless exempted by subsection (d) hereof.
Applications will consist of providing the application information set forth in
Section
1080.06  et seq. and as reasonably required by the Director of Public Works.
   (c)   No Construction Without Certificate of Registration.  Following the
effective date of this chapter, no person shall construct or perform any work
on or in, use any system or any part thereof located on or in, any rights-of-
way without first obtaining a certificate of registration unless otherwise
exempted pursuant to subsection (d) hereof. For the purposes of this section

   (e)   Systems in Place Without a Certificate of Registration.  Beginning one
year after the effective date of this chapter, any system or part of a system
found in a rights-of-way for which a certificate of registration has not been
obtained shall be deemed to be a nuisance and an unauthorized use of the
rights-of-way. The City may exercise any remedies or rights under the law,
including, but not limited to abating the nuisance; taking possession of the
facilities and/or non-complying portion of such system; and/or prosecuting the
violator.
   (f)   Future Uses.  In allowing facilities to be placed in the rights-of-
way, the City is not liable for any damages caused thereby to any provider's
facilities that are already in place.  No provider is entitled to rely on the

(Ord. 12-03.  Passed 5-19-03.)
1080.03   DISCONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS, ABANDONED AND UNUSED FACILITIES.
   (a)   Actions Upon Discontinuance.  A provider who has discontinued or is
discontinuing operation of any system in the City shall:
      (1)   Provide information satisfactory to the City that the provider's
obligations for its system in the rights-of-way under this chapter and any
other chapters in the Codified Ordinances or other laws have been lawfully
assumed by another applicant and/or provider;
      (2)   Submit a written proposal to re-use its facilities in a manner that
promotes the City's goals of providing innovative and economic solutions to
efficiently and economically utilize a potentially limited rights-of-way
capacity. Said proposal must be approved by the Director of Public Works;
      (3)   Abandonment of facilities shall be per generally accepted industry
standards. Said proposal must be approved by the Director of Public Works;
      (4)   Completely remove its entire system within a reasonable amount of
time and in a manner acceptable to the City;
      (5)   Submit to the City, in good faith and within a reasonable amount of
time, and in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21, a proposal for
transferring ownership of its facilities to the City. If a provider proceeds
under this clause, the City may, at its option:
         A.   Purchase the facilities; or
         B.   Unless a valid removal bond has already been provided pursuant to
Section
1080.21(b), require the provider to post a bond in an amount sufficient to
reimburse the City for its reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in
removing the facilities.
   (b)   Abandonment.  Facilities of a provider who fails to comply with this
section and which remain unused facilities shall be deemed to be abandoned.
Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise any
remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to:
abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities and restoring them to
a useable condition subject to the finding of the PUCO pursuant to the
requirements of Ohio R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21; or requiring removal of the
facilities by the provider or by the provider's surety. If the City determines
to require a provider to remove unused facilities in any rights-of-way, the
City shall use reasonable efforts to direct that this removal occur in
conjunction with other scheduled excavation of the rights-of-way. If the City
abates the nuisance it may take all action necessary to recover its costs to
abate said nuisance, including but not limited to, those methods set forth in
Ohio R.C. 715.261.
(Ord. 12-03.  Passed 5-19-03.)
1080.04   NATURE OF ISSUANCE.
   A certificate of registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in
the rights-of- way. A certificate of registration is only the nonexclusive,
limited right to occupy rights-of- way in the City for the limited purposes and
for the limited period stated in the certificate of registration and in
accordance with this chapter and any associated permit. For those providers
with a valid gas or electric franchise, the provisions of a certificate of
registration shall be deemed as regulatory in nature and shall not be
interpreted to limit the right to occupy the rights-of-way which may have been
granted by such franchise. The rights to occupy the right-of-way itself may not
be subdivided or subleased; provided, however, that two or more providers may
collocate facilities in the same area of the rights-of-way so long as each such
provider complies with the provisions of this chapter. Collocating providers
may file a joint application for a right-of-way construction permit. A
certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from obtaining
appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its
facilities on facilities of others, including the City's facilities. A
certificate of registration does not prevent a provider from leasing space in
or on the provider's system, so long as the sharing of facilities does not
cause a violation of law, including the provisions of this chapter. A
certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from complying with any
provisions of this chapter and other applicable law.
(Ord. 12-03.  Passed 5-19-03.)
1080.05   OTHER APPROVALS, PERMITS AND AGREEMENTS.
   In addition to a certificate of registration, providers shall obtain any and
all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for
the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state
and local authorities and upon the City's reasonable request, shall provide
copies of such documents to the City. Further, a certificate of registration
issued pursuant to this chapter shall not entitle a provider to use, alter,
convert to, or interfere with, the facilities, easements, poles, conduits,
lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable, or any other real or personal property
of any kind whatsoever under the management or control of the City.

occupying the rights-of-way shall defend, indemnify, and hold the City harmless

shall develop and maintain a schedule of permit fees based on fair and
reasonable criteria. The Director of Public Works shall conduct a study of
degradation to and reduction in the useful life of the rights-of-way resulting
from construction. After such study is completed and after providing notice to
providers with a valid certificate of registration, the Director of Public
Works may include in the schedule of permit fees an amount sufficient to
recover the degradation and reduction in the useful life of the rights-of-way
that will result from the construction to take place thereon. “Degradation and
the reduction in the useful life” for the purpose of this section means the
accelerated depreciation of the rights-of-way caused by construction in or
disturbance of the rights-of-way, resulting in the need to reconstruct or
repair such rights-of-way earlier than would be required if the construction
did not occur. No right-of-way construction permit shall be issued without
payment of right-of-way construction permit fees except to the City, County, or
RTA which shall be exempt. right-of-way construction permit fees that were paid
for a permit that the City has revoked due to breach are not refundable.
   (f)   Joint Applications.  Applicants are encouraged to make joint
application for right- of-way construction permits to work in the rights-of-way
at the same place and time. Joint applicants shall have the ability to divide
amongst themselves, in proportions the parties find appropriate, any applicable
right-of-way construction permit fees.
(Ord. 12-03.  Passed 5-19-03; Ord. 05-17.  Passed 4-17-17.)
1080.18   CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
   (a)   Technical Information Required.  Prior to commencement of any initial
construction of facilities in the rights-of-way, except for repair, maintenance
or replacement with like facilities only, a right-of-way construction permittee
shall provide technical information about the proposed route of construction.
The technical information required shall consist of, at minimum, completion of
the following tasks:
      (1)   Secure all available “as-built” plans, plats, and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all provider's
facilities along the proposed construction route.
      (2)   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
provider's facilities along the proposed construction route, including, but not
limited to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts, and visible street cut
repairs.
      (3)   Determine and record the presence and location as precisely as is
reasonably possible of all underground facilities the applicant or person on
whose behalf the permit was applied for owns or controls in the rights-of- way
along the proposed system route. Upon request of the Director of Public Works,
a permittee shall also record and identify the general location of all other
facilities in the rights-of-way along the proposed system route. For the
purposes of this section, general location shall mean the alignment of other
facilities in the rights-of-way, but shall not necessarily mean the depth of
other facilities in the rights-of-way.
      (4)   Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of the tasks
described in this section on the permittee’s proposed system route maps,
construction plans, plan sheets, or computer aided drafting and design (CADD)
files, or other data files in a mutually agreeable format.
      (5)   Where the proposed location of facilities and the location of
existing underground facilities appear to conflict with the plans as drafted,
right-of- way construction permittee has the option of either utilizing non-
destructive digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points
identified to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and
spatial position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
underground facilities, or re-designing the construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. A right-of-way construction permittee shall not excavate
more than a three foot by three foot square hole in the rights-of- way in order
to make this determination to complete this task.
      (6)   Plot, incorporate, and reconcile the data obtained by completion of
the tasks described in this subsection (a) with the updated system route maps,
construction plans and CADD files or other data files in a mutually agreeable
format as described in subsection (a)(4).
      (7)   Based on the data collected upon completion of the tasks described
in this section, adjust the proposed system design.
   (b)   Copy to City.  Upon completion of the tasks described in subsection
(a), the right- of-way construction permittee shall plot and incorporate the
data on the right-of-way construction permittee's proposed system route maps,
construction plans, plan sheets, and CADD files, or other data files in a
mutually agreeable format and deliver a copy to the Department of Public Works.
   (c)   Qualified Firm.  All technical information gathered pursuant to this
section shall be performed by a firm specializing in utility engineering or by
the right-of-way construction permittee if the right-of-way construction
permittee is qualified to complete the project itself.
   (d)   Cost of Supplying Technical Information.  The right-of-way
construction permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with subsections (a)
through (c) of this section.
   (e)   Construction Schedule.  Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter,
or unless the Director of Public Works waives any of the requirements of this
section due to unique or unusual circumstances, a right-of-way construction
permittee shall be required to: submit a written construction and restoration
schedule to the City two working days before commencing any work in or about
the rights-of-way and shall further notify the City not less than two working
days in advance of any excavation in the rights-of-way. This section shall
apply to all situations with the exception of circumstances under Section
1080.19 and Section
1080.19(d)(1).
   (f)   Location of Facilities.
      (1)   The placement of new facilities and replacement of old facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable laws.
      (2)   The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of
new or additional facilities within the rights-of-way if the right-of-way is
full. In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety, and welfare,
the condition of the rights-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential
utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the rights-of-way, future
City and County plans for public improvements, development projects which have
been determined to be in the public interest, and the non-discriminatory and
competitively neutral treatment of providers.
      (3)   Should it be determined by the City that any existing poles in the
rights-of- way are full, then those poles may be replaced with bigger and/or
taller poles in order to accommodate additional facilities or systems but only
after written permission has been received from the Director of Public Works
and the right-of-way construction permittee has made reasonable attempts to
reach an acceptable solution without replacement with bigger and/or taller
poles. This paragraph shall not apply to replacement of any existing pole(s)
with identically sized pole(s) which results from the destruction of or
hazardous condition of the existing pole(s) as long as no new facilities or
additional facilities are attached.
   (g)   Least Disruptive Technology.  All construction or maintenance of
facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the rights-of-way. Specifically, every permittee, if
technologically and economically feasible, shall utilize Trenchless Technology,
at the request of the Public Works Director. In addition, all cable, wire or
fiber optic cable installed in the subsurface rights-of-way under this chapter
may be required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire
or fiber optic cable may be installed under this chapter using “direct bury”
techniques.
   (h)   Special Exceptions.  The City may grant a special exception to the
requirements of subsections (f) and (g) hereof if a permittee, upon
application, demonstrates with written evidence that:
      (1)   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety or welfare.
      (2)   Permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and the
potential adverse impact on the permittee's construction schedule resulting
from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively inhibits
the ability of the permittee to provide services in the City.
      (3)   The permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably
discriminates against the permittee in favor of another person.
   (i)   Relocation of Facilities.
      (1)   A provider shall promptly and at its own expense, permanently
remove and relocate its facilities in the rights-of-way whenever the City finds
it necessary to request such removal and relocation as defined in paragraphs
(A) and (B) below. In instances where the City requests removal and/or
relocation, the City shall waive all applicable right-of-way construction
permit fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the provider shall restore the
rights-of-way to the same or better condition it was in prior to said removal
or relocation. If existing poles are required to be removed and/or relocated,
then the existing poles will be replaced with poles of the same or similar size
unless waived in writing by the Director of Public Works. The Director of
Public Works may request relocation and/or removal in order to prevent
unreasonable interference by the provider's facilities with:
         A.   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the City;
         B.   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the rights-of-way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider who has facilities in the
right-of- way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the City, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated portion
or excess portion in conformity with Ohio R.C. 723.041.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the City, a provider fails to
commence the removal process and/or relocation of its facilities as designated
by the City, within the period established by the Director of Public Works
after reviewing the removal and/or relocation with the provider but in no event
less than thirty days after the City's removal order is served upon provider,
or if a provider fails to substantially complete such removal, including all
associated repair of the rights-of-way of the City, within twelve months
thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, the City
shall have the right to:
         A.   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the facilities
belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the facilities to another person for operation; or
         B.   Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the provider in,
on, over or under the rights-of-way of the City at provider's cost and expense,
by another person, however the City shall have no liability for any damage
caused by such action and the provider shall be liable to the City for all
reasonable costs incurred by the City in such action; and
         C.   To the extent consistent with applicable law, any portion of the
provider's facilities in, on, over or under the rights-of-way of the City
designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the provider shall
belong to and become the property of the City without payment to the provider,
and the provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the City shall
request, in form and substance acceptable to the City, to evidence such
ownership by the City.
   (j)   Pre-Excavation Facilities Location.  Before the start date of any
rights-of-way excavation for a public improvement project, each provider who
has facilities located in the area to be excavated shall be responsible to mark
the horizontal and make every reasonable attempt to mark the approximate
vertical placement of all its facilities. All providers shall notify and work
closely with the excavation contractor in an effort to establish the exact
location of its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
   (k)   Rights-of-Way Restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of the
rights-of- way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified
in the permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee must restore the
general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including trench backfill,
paving and its foundations in accordance with any applicable laws and the
standards established by the Director of Public Works, and must inspect the
area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the same condition for
twelve months thereafter.
      (2)   In approving an application for a permit, the City may choose
either to have the permittee restore the rights-of-way or the City may restore
the rights-of- way itself.
      (3)   If the City chooses to allow permittee to restore the rights-of-
way, right-of- way construction permittee shall at the time of application of a
right-of-way construction permit post a construction bond in an amount
determined by the City to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the
rights-of-way to its pre-excavation condition. If, twelve months after
completion of the restoration of the rights-of-way, the City determines that
the rights-of-way have been properly restored, the surety on the construction
bond shall be released.
      (4)   The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified by the City. The City shall have the authority to
prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so in written
procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The City in
exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards and
considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the rights-of-way; the traffic volume carried by the
rights-of-way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the rights-of-
way; the pre-excavation condition of the rights-of-way; the remaining life-
expectancy of the rights-of-way affected by the excavation; whether the
relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable
balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the rights-of-
way that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to
the rights-of-way; and the likelihood that the particular method of restoration
would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the rights-of- way that would
otherwise take place. Methods of restoration shall be according to the rules
and regulations, and any standards established by the Director of Public Works
or any other laws.
      (5)   By restoring the rights-of-way itself, the permittee guarantees its
pavement restoration work and shall maintain it for twelve months following its
completion. During this twelve month period, it shall, upon notification from
the Department of Public Works, correct all restoration work to the extent
necessary using the method required by the Department of Public Works. Weather
permitting, said work shall be completed within five business days of the
receipt of the notice from the Department of Public Works.
      (6)   If the permittee fails to restore the rights-of-way in the manner
and to the condition required by the City, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all repairs required by the City, the City, at its option, may
do such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the City, within thirty
days of billing, the cost of restoring the rights-of-way and any other costs
incurred by the City. Upon failure to pay, the City may call upon any bond or
letter of credit posted by permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and
equitable remedies.
   (l)   Damage to Other Facilities.
      (1)   In the case of an emergency and, if possible, after reasonable
efforts to contact the provider seeking a timely response, when the City
performs work in the rights-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support,
or move a provider’s facilities to protect those facilities, the costs
associated therewith will be billed to that provider and shall be paid within
thirty days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the City may pursue
all legal and equitable remedies in the event a provider does not pay or the
City may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by permittee and pursue
any and all legal or equitable remedies.
      (2)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
facilities in the rights-of-way which it or its facilities damage. Each
provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another provider caused during the City's response to an
emergency caused by that provider's facilities.
   (m)   Rights-of-Way Vacation.  If the City vacates a rights-of-way which
contains the facilities of a provider, such vacation shall be subject to the
provisions of Ohio R.C. 723.041. If the vacation requires the relocation of the
provider's facilities and if the vacation proceedings are initiated by the
provider, the provider will pay the relocation costs. If the vacation requires
the relocation of the provider's facilities and if the vacation proceedings are
initiated by the City for a public purpose, the provider or permittee must pay
the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the City, the provider or
permittee.
   (n)   Installation Requirements.  The excavation, backfilling, restoration,
and all other work performed in the rights-of-way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable laws and the standards as promulgated by the
Director of Public Works.
   (o)   Inspection.
      (1)   When the construction under any permit hereunder is completed, the
permittee shall notify the Department of Public Works.
      (2)   The permittee shall make the construction site available to the
Inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction.
      (3)   At any time, including the time of inspection, the Inspector may
order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the
health, safety, or welfare of the public, violates any law, or which violates
the terms and conditions of the permit and/or this chapter.
      (4)   The Inspector may issue an order to correct work which does not
conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. The
order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for
revocation of the permit. The order may be served on the permittee as provided
in Section
1080.23(d). An order may be appealed to the Director of Public Works. The
decision of the Director of Public Works may be appealed to the City Manager
whose decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten days after issuance
of the order, the provider shall present proof to the Director of Public Works
that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented
within the required time, the Director of Public Works may revoke the permit
pursuant to Section
1080.19(d).
   (p)   Other Obligations.  Obtaining a right-of-way construction permit does
not relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits,
licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required by the City, or any other
city, county, state, or federal laws.
      (1)   A permittee shall comply with all requirements of laws, including
the requirements of the Ohio Utility Protection Service.
      (2)   A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all
applicable laws and standards and is responsible for all work done in the
rights-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (3)   No rights-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an emergency as outlined in Section
1080.19(d)(1).
      (4)   A permittee shall not so obstruct a rights-of-way that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with.
      (5)   Private vehicles other than necessary construction vehicles may not
be parked within or adjacent to a permit area. The loading or unloading of
trucks adjacent to a permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized
by the permit.
   (q)   Undergrounding Required.  Any owner of property abutting upon a street
or alley where service facilities are located underground and where the service
connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to install
underground any service delivery infrastructure from the property line to the
buildings or other structures on such property to which such service is
supplied.
(Ord. 12-03.  Passed 5-19-03.)
1080.19   ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (a)   Mandatory Denial of Permit.  Except in the case of an emergency, no
right-of-way construction permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any person who has not yet made an application;
      (2)   To any person or their agent who has outstanding debt owed to the
City;
      (3)   To any person or their agent as to whom there exists grounds for
the revocation of a permit; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the Director of Public Works, the issuance
of a permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or
interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The
Director of Public Works, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the
safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the rights-of-way,
and by considerations relating to the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (b)   Permissive Denial.  The Director of Public Works may deny a permit in
order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the
rights-of-way, or when necessary to protect the rights-of-way and its users.
   (c)   Discretionary Issuance.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
1080.19(a) and 1080.19(b), the Director of Public Works may issue a permit in
any case where the permit is necessary:
      (1)   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
permit applicant if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the City;
      (2)   To allow such customer to materially improve its service; or
      (3)   To allow a new economic development project. To be granted a permit
under this section, the permit applicant must not have had knowledge of the
hardship, the plans for improvement of service, or the development project at
the time it was required to submit its list of next year projects.
   (d)   Work Done Without a Permit. 
      (1)   Emergency situations.
         A.   Each provider shall, as soon as is reasonably possible, notify
the Director of Public Works of any event regarding its facilities which it
considers to be an emergency. The provider may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. Within two business days,
unless otherwise extended by the Director of Public Works, after the occurrence
or discovery of the emergency (whichever is later), the provider shall apply
for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill all
the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter
for any and all actions taken in response to the emergency.
         B.   In the event that the City becomes aware of an emergency
regarding a provider's facilities, the City may attempt to contact the provider
or system representative of each provider affected, or potentially affected, by
the emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever action it deems
necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be
borne by the provider whose facilities caused the emergency.
      (2)   Non-emergency situations. Except in the case of an emergency, any
provider who constructs in, on, above, within, over, below or through a right-
of-way without a valid permit shall subsequently obtain a permit, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
Codified Ordinances, deposit with the City the fees necessary to correct any
damage to the rights-of-way and comply with all of the requirements of this
chapter.
   (e)   Revocation of Permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to the Codified Ordinances
as a privilege and not as a right. The City reserves the right, as provided
herein, to revoke any permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any law or any provision or
condition of the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but
shall not be limited to, the following:
         A.   The violation of any provision or condition of the permit;
         B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the City or its citizens;
         C.   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
permit;
         D.   The failure to obtain and/or maintain required construction or
removal bonds and/or insurance;
         E.   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
certificate of registration;
         F.   The failure to complete construction in a timely manner; or
         G.   The failure to correct any nonconformity as ordered pursuant to
Section
1080.18(o)(4).
      (2)   If the Director of Public Works determines that the permittee has
committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any law or any
provision or condition of the permit, the Director of Public Works shall serve
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Upon
a substantial breach, as stated above, the Director of Public Works may place
additional or revised conditions on the permit.
      (3)   By the close of the next business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the Director of Public
Works with a plan, acceptable to the Director of Public Works, for its
correction. Permittee's failure to so contact the Director of Public Works, or
the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to
reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation
of the permit.
      (4)   From time to time, the Director of Public Works may establish a
list of standard conditions for the permit. A substantial breach of any
condition shall also constitute an unauthorized use of the public rights-of-way
as defined in Section
1080.14.
      (5)   If a permittee commits a second substantial breach as outlined
above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and not be allowed
further permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs.
      (6)   If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the City
for the City's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of
collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such
revocation.
(Ord. 12-03.  Passed 5-19-03.)
1080.20   CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS.
   (a)   Construction Bond.  Prior to the commencement of any construction, a
right-of- way construction permittee, excluding the County, City, or RTA shall
deposit with the Director of Public Works an irrevocable, unconditional letter
of credit and/or surety bond in an amount to be determined by the Director of
Public Works to be appropriate based upon fair and reasonable criteria. Unless
a construction default, problem, or deficiency involves an emergency or
endangers the safety of the general public, the Director of Public Works shall
serve the right-of-way construction permittee with notice detailing any
construction default, problem, or deficiency. If the Director of Public Works
determines that correction or repair of the construction default, problem or
deficiency has not occurred or has not been substantially initiated within ten
calendar days after the date following service of notification and detailing
the construction default, problem or deficiency, then the City may attach the
letter of credit or surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be
served on the right-of-way construction permittee by the Director of Public
Works.
   (b)   Removal Bond.  Upon issuance of a certificate of registration, and
continuously thereafter until 120 days after a provider's facilities have been
removed from the rights-of- way, (unless the Director of Public Works notifies
the provider that a reasonably longer period shall apply), a provider shall
deposit with the Director of Public Works and maintain an irrevocable,
unconditional letter of credit or a surety bond in an amount equal to or
greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). The Director of Public Works
shall make all reasonable effort to allow provider a period of five business
days after serving notification to correct or repair any default, problem or
deficiency prior to Director of Public Works' attachment of letter of credit or
surety bond regarding the removal of facilities. Upon attachment, written
notice shall be provided to the provider by the Director of Public Works.
   (c)   Blanket Bond.  In lieu of the construction bond required by subection
(a) hereof and the removal bond required by subsection (b) hereof, provider may
deposit with the Director of Public Works an irrevocable, unconditional letter
of credit and/or surety bond in the amount of five million dollars
($5,000,000). Unless a construction default, problem or deficiency involves an
emergency or endangers the safety of the general public, the Director of Public
Works shall make all reasonable effort to allow permittee a period of five
business days after sending notification in writing to the last known business
address to correct or repair any construction default, problem or deficiency
prior to Director of Public Works' attachment of letter of credit or surety
bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be provided to the provider by the
Director of Public Works.
   (d)   Self Bonding.  In lieu of the construction bond required by subsection
(a) hereof, the removal bond required by subsection (b) hereof and the blanket
bond required by subsection (c) hereof, only the County, City, or RTA may
submit a statement to the Director of Public Works requesting to self-bond.
   (e)   Purposes.  The bonds required by this section, and any self bonding to
the extent it has been permitted, shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee or provider of all terms,
conditions and obligations of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee or provider's violation of this chapter or its failure to comply
with all rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the City
issued pursuant to this chapter;
      (3)   The payment of all compensation due to the City, including permit
fees;
      (4)   The payment of premiums for the liability insurance required
pursuant to this chapter;
      (5)   The removal of facilities from the rights-of-way pursuant to this
chapter;
      (6)   The payment to the City of any amounts for which the permittee or
provider is liable that are not paid by it's insurance or other surety; and
      (7)   The payment of any other amounts which become due to the City
pursuant to this chapter or other law.
   (f)   Form.  The bond documents required by this section, and any
replacement bond documents, shall contain the following endorsement: “It is
hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled or not renewed
by the surety nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the
surety until ninety (90) days after completion of Construction of the
Facilities and, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or
not renewed by the surety without ninety (90) days advance written notice to
the City of surety's intention to cancel or not renew this bond.”

   (b)   Severability.  If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase,
or portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional
by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion
shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a
regulatory body or a court of competent jurisdiction should determine by a
final, non-appealable order that any permit, right or any portions of this
chapter are illegal or unenforceable, then any such permit or right granted or
deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered as a revocable permit with a
mutual right in either party to terminate without cause upon giving sixty days
written notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a
revocable permit shall be the same requirements and conditions as set forth in
the permit, right or registration, respectively, except for conditions relating

and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or the same
may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the City, shall be in full
force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the City at any time. A
permittee or provider is deemed to acknowledge that its rights are subject to

agree to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the City pursuant
to such powers.

proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated
prior to the expiration of said 120 days or unless:

be construed as a renewal or other extension of the certificate of
registration, nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the
City as a result of such continued operation after the term, including, but not
limited to, damages and restitution. Any conflict between the issuance of a
certificate of registration or of a permit and any other present or future

1420.02   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code, as adopted in Section
1420.01, is to:
   (a)   Provide uniform minimum standards and requirements for the erection,
construction, repair, alteration and maintenance of buildings, including
construction of industrialized units, such standards relating to the
conservation of energy, safety and sanitation of buildings for their intended
use and occupancy;
   (b)   Establish such requirements, in terms of performance objectives for
the use intended;
   (c)   Permit, to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units, which tend to reduce the cost of construction and
erection without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and
security of the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and
without preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or
methods of construction; and
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practical, the standardization of
construction practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including
methods employed to produce industrialized units.
(OAC 101.3)  (Ord. 10-02.  Passed 8-19-02; Ord. 13-10.  Passed 11-15-10.)

crop year on farms owned or operated by the seller (see Ohio R.C. 3781.06 and
3781.061);
   (f)   Agricultural labor camps as defined in Ohio R.C. 3733.41;

U.S.C.;
      (2)   Contributed to the State of Ohio such amounts for the acquisition,

such additional buildings or structures as he or she determines to be required
because of the failure of existing facilities to meet the purposes of Chapter
133 of the U.S.C.; or

1442.06   PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL PERMITS.
   (a)   Fees for Reinspection.  Permit fees provide for customary inspections
only.  Where additional inspections or trips are made necessary because of
incomplete or faulty work, an incorrect address given, failure of the owner or
agent to keep an appointment or similar reasons, no fee shall be charged for
the first reinspection, but a fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be
charged for each additional reinspection or extra trip.  This fee shall be paid
by the holder of the permit before a reinspection is made.  It is not the
intent of this subsection to penalize others for the shortcomings of the
constructor or installer.
   (b)   Fees for Commencing Work Prior to Permit Issuance.  Where a permit is
required for a particular type of work, and such type of work is commenced on a
project before a permit has been obtained therefor, the Chief Building Official
shall take necessary steps to determine whether work performed prior to the
date of permit issuance and inspection conforms to this Building Code.  The fee
for making such necessary investigations prior to the issuance of a permit
shall be equal to the fee for the permit and shall be in addition thereto, but
in no event shall the fee for investigation prior to the issuance of a permit
exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).  The payment of the aforesaid fees
shall not relieve any person from fully complying with the requirements of this
Building Code in the execution of the work nor from any penalty prescribed in
this Building Code. 
   (c)   Fees for Work Not Specifically Provided.  The amount of fees for

Maintenance Code, hereinafter referred to as "this code."
101.2 Scope.  The provisions of this code shall apply to all existing
residential and nonresidential structures and all existing premises and
constitute minimum requirements and standards for premises, structures,
equipment and facilities for light, ventilation, space, heating, sanitation,
protection from the elements, a reasonable level of safety from fire and other
hazards, and for a reasonable level of sanitary maintenance; the responsibility
of owners, an owner's authorized agent, operators and occupants; the occupancy
of existing structures and premises, and for administration, enforcement and
penalties.
101.3 Intent.  This code shall be construed to secure its expressed intent,
which is to ensure public health, safety and welfare insofar as they are
affected by the continued occupancy and maintenance of structures and premises.
101.4 Severability.  If a section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of
this code is, for any reason, held to be unconstitutional, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this code.
      (2)   Section 102  Applicability.
102.1 General.  Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a
specific requirement, the specific requirement shall govern. Where differences
occur between provisions of this code and the referenced standards, the
provisions of this code shall apply. Where, in a specific case, different
sections of this code specify different requirements, the most restrictive
shall govern.
102.2 Maintenance.  Equipment, systems, devices and safe-guards required by
this code or a previous regulation or code under which the structure or
premises was constructed, altered or repaired shall be maintained in good
working order. An owner, owner's authorized agent, operator or occupant shall
not cause any service, facility, equipment or utility that is required under
this section to be removed from, shut off from or discontinued for any occupied
dwelling, except for such temporary interruption as necessary while repairs or
alterations are in progress. The requirements of this code are not intended to
provide the basis for removal or abrogation of fire protection and safety
systems and devices in existing structures. Except as otherwise specified
herein, the owner or the owner's authorized agent shall be responsible for the
maintenance of buildings, structures and premises.
102.3 Application of other codes.  Repairs, additions or alterations to a

abolish or impair existing remedies of the jurisdiction or its officers or
agencies relating to the removal or demolition of any structure which is
dangerous, unsafe and unsanitary.

that are caused directly or indirectly by the enforcement of this code shall be
executed and installed in a workmanlike manner and installed in accordance with
the manufacturer's instructions.

existing buildings or structures designated as historic buildings when such
buildings or structures are judged by the code official to be safe and in the
public interest of health, safety and welfare.
102.7 Requirements not covered by code.  Requirements necessary for the
strength, stability or proper operation of an existing fixture, structure or
equipment, or for the public safety, health and general welfare, not
specifically covered by this code, shall be determined by the code official.
102.8 Application of references.  References to chapter or section numbers, or
to provisions not specifically identified by number, shall be construed to

104.1 General.  The code official is hereby authorized and directed to enforce
the provisions of this code. The code official shall have the authority to
render interpretations of this code and to adopt policies and procedures in
order to clarify the application of its provisions. Such interpretations,
policies and procedures shall be in compliance with the intent and purpose of
this code. Such policies and procedures shall not have the effect of waiving
requirements specifically provided for in this code.
104.2 Inspections.  The code official shall make all of the required
inspections, or shall accept reports of inspection by approved agencies or
individuals. All reports of such inspections shall be in writing and be
certified by a responsible officer of such approved agency or by the

opinion as deemed necessary to report upon unusual technical issues that arise,
subject to the approval of the appointing authority.
104.3 Right of entry.  Where it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce

requirements. The details of action granting modifications shall be recorded
and entered in the department files.
105.2 Alternative materials, design and methods of construction and equipment. 
The provisions of this code are not intended to prevent the installation of any

complies with the intent of the provisions of this code, and that the material,
method or work offered is, for the purpose intended, at least the equivalent of
that prescribed in this code in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire
resistance, durability and safety. Where the alternative material, design or
method of construction is not approved, the code official shall respond in
writing, stating the reasons why the alternative was not approved.
105.3 Required testing.  Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance
with the provisions of this code, or evidence that a material or method does
not conform to the requirements of this code, or in order to substantiate
claims for alternative materials or methods, the code official shall have the

offense. An offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a
violation occurs or continues.
106.5 Abatement of violation. The imposition of the penalties herein prescribed
shall not preclude the legal officer of the jurisdiction from instituting
appropriate action to restrain, correct or abate a violation, or to prevent
illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises, or to stop an illegal
act, conduct, business or utilization of the building, structure or premises.
106.6 Informal Resolution of Violation. The code official may, at his or her
discretion, attempt to informally resolve violations or suspected violations of
this Code without issuing the notices and orders in the manner prescribed
below. The code official shall be encouraged to utilize this procedure to the
extent practical to achieve compliance with this Code.
106.7 Repeat Violators. For the second violation of the same general character

   6.   When applicable, include a statement of the right to file a lien in

provisions of the compliance order or notice of violation have been complied
with, or until such owner shall first furnish the grantee, transferee,
mortgagee or lessee a true copy of any compliance order or notice of violation
issued by the code official and shall furnish to the code official a signed and
notarized statement from the grantee, transferee, mortgagee or lessee,
acknowledging the receipt of such compliance order or notice of violation and

      (8)   Section 108 Unsafe Structures and Equipment.
108.1 General.  When a structure or equipment is found by the code official to
be unsafe, or when a structure is found unfit for human occupancy, or is found
unlawful, such structure shall be condemned pursuant to the provisions of this
code.
   108.1.1 Unsafe structures.  An unsafe structure is one that is found to be
dangerous to the life, health, property or safety of the public or the
occupants of the structure by not providing minimum safeguards to protect or
warn occupants in the event of fire, or because such structure contains unsafe
equipment or is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe or of
such faulty construction or unstable foundation, that partial or complete
collapse is possible.
   108.1.2 Unsafe equipment.  Unsafe equipment includes any boiler, heating
equipment, elevator, moving stairway, electrical wiring or device, flammable
liquid containers or other equipment on the premises or within the structure
which is in such disrepair or condition that such equipment is a hazard to
life, health, property or safety of the public or occupants of the premises or
structure.
   108.1.3 Structure unfit for human occupancy.  A structure is unfit for human
occupancy whenever the code official finds that such structure is unsafe,
unlawful or, because of the degree to which the structure is in disrepair or
lacks maintenance, is insanitary, vermin or rat infested, contains filth and
contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary or heating
facilities or other essential equipment required by this code, or because the
location of the structure constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the
structure or to the public. The structure must have water, electricity and gas
(where applicable) service.
   108.1.4 Unlawful structure.  An unlawful structure is one found in whole or
in part to be occupied by more persons than permitted under this code, or was
erected, altered or occupied contrary to law.
   108.1.5 Dangerous structure or premises.  For the purpose of this code, any
structure or premises that has any or all of the conditions or defects
described below shall be considered dangerous:
      1.   Any door, aisle, passageway, stairway, exit or other means of egress
that does not conform to the approved building or fire code of the jurisdiction
as related to the requirements for existing buildings.
      2.   The walking surface of any aisle, passageway, stairway, exit or
other means of egress is so warped, worn loose, torn or otherwise unsafe as to
not provide safe and adequate means of egress.
      3.   Any portion of a building, structure or appurtenance that has been
damaged by fire, earthquake, wind, flood, deterioration, neglect, abandonment,
vandalism or by any other cause to such an extent that it is likely to
partially or completely collapse, or to become detached or dislodged.
      4.   Any portion of a building, or any member, appurtenance or
ornamentation on the exterior thereof that is not of sufficient strength or
stability, or is not so anchored, attached or fastened in place so as to be
capable of resisting natural or artificial loads of one and one-half the
original designed value.
      5.   The building or structure, or part of the building or structure,
because of dilapidation, deterioration, decay, faulty construction, the removal
or movement of some portion of the ground necessary for the support, or for any
other reason, is likely to partially or completely collapse, or some portion of
the foundation or underpinning of the building or structure is likely to fail
or give way.
      6.   The building or structure, or any portion thereof, is clearly unsafe
for its use and occupancy.
      7.   The building or structure is neglected, damaged, dilapidated,
unsecured or abandoned so as to become an attractive nuisance to children who
might play in the building or structure to their danger, becomes a harbor for
vagrants, criminals or immoral persons, or enables persons to resort to the
building or structure for committing a nuisance or an unlawful act.
      8.   Any building or structure has been constructed, exists or is
maintained in violation of any specific requirement or prohibition applicable
to such building or structure provided by the approved building or fire code of
the jurisdiction, or of any law or ordinance to such an extent as to present
either a substantial risk of fire, building collapse or any other threat to
life and safety.
      9.   A building or structure, used or intended to be used for dwelling
purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay, damage,
faulty construction or arrangement, inadequate light, ventilation, mechanical
or plumbing system, or otherwise, is determined by the code official to be

1.01   Purpose of the Unified Development Ordinance
The City of Centerville carries out the policies of the Comprehensive Plan by
classifying and regulating the uses of land and structures within the City.
This Unified Development Ordinance (UDO) is adopted to protect and promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare of the community. More specifically,
the purpose of this UDO is to:
   A.   Provide standards and guidelines for the continuing orderly growth and
development of the City;
   B.   Conserve and protect the City's natural, cultural and historic
resources;
   C.   Ensure that proposed development and new land uses conserve energy and
natural resources;
   D.   Create a comprehensive and stable pattern of land uses upon which to
plan transportation, water supply, sewerage, energy, and other public
facilities and utilities;
   E.   Ensure that proposed development is of human scale, pedestrian-
oriented, and designed to create attractive streetscapes and pedestrian
spaces;   
   F.   Minimize vehicle traffic by providing for a mixture of land uses,
pedestrian-oriented development, compact community form, safe and effective
traffic circulation, and adequate on- and off-street parking facilities;   
   G.   Provide neighborhoods with a variety of housing types to serve the
needs of a diverse population; and   
   H.   Ensure compatibility between different types of development and land
uses.
1.03   Title
This Unified Development Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the
"Unified Development Ordinance of the City of Centerville, Ohio," the "UDO,"
the "Unified Development Ordinance," or just the "Ordinance."
1.05   Ordinance Authority
The authority to adopt this UDO within the City of Centerville, Ohio, is
derived from the authority provided under Article 5 of the Charter of the City
of Centerville, Ohio and from the powers granted and limitations imposed by the
Ohio Revised Code. Whenever the Charter or other laws referenced in this UDO
have been amended or superseded, this UDO shall be considered amended in
reference to the new or revised Charter or other laws.
1.07   Ordinance Jurisdiction
This UDO shall apply to all land and land development within the incorporated
area of the City of Centerville, Ohio. The City may exercise extraterritorial
jurisdiction for a distance of up to 3 miles of its corporate limits if county
or township zoning is not in effect within the area as provided in Section
711.09 of the Ohio Revised Code and the City has adopted a major thoroughfare,
parks, and public open space plan for the territory within the City limits and
within three miles of the City. The Planning Commission may receive advice from
the county or regional planning commission upon all subdivisions plats located
within 3 miles of the corporate limits.
1.09   Ordinance Effective Date
This UDO was enacted by Ordinance No. 14-08, adopted by the Centerville City
Council on December 15, 2008, and shall become effective on  January 15, 2009.
1.11   Repeal of Existing Ordinances
The following Ordinances are hereby repealed:
Ordinance Number 11-86, An Ordinance Enacting Revised Zoning Districts and
Regulations for the City of Centerville, Ohio in Accordance with the provisions
of Chapter 713 of the Ohio Revised Code adopted on July 21, 1986 and all
amendments thereto;
   Chapter 838, Adult Entertainment, of the Centerville Municipal Code;
   Part 12, Title Four, Subdivision Regulations, of the Centerville Municipal
Code;
   Chapter 1202, Planning Commission of the Centerville Municipal Code;
   Chapter 1204, Parklands, of the Centerville Municipal Code;
   Chapter 1206, Landmarks, of the Centerville Municipal Code;
   Chapter 1460, Erosion and Sedimentation Control, of the Centerville
Municipal Code;
   Chapter 1462, Flood Damage Prevention, of the Centerville Municipal Code;
   Chapter 1466, Outdoor Dish-Type Antennas, of the Centerville Municipal Code;
   Chapter 1468, Outdoor Illumination, of the Centerville Municipal Code;
This UDO and the referenced Official Zoning Map hereby replace all stated
Sections, Chapters, and Ordinances of the Centerville Municipal Code.
1.13   Relationship to Repealed Ordinances
To the extent that the provisions of this UDO are the same in substance as the
previously adopted provisions that they replace in the zoning ordinances, they
shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments unless
otherwise specifically provided. In particular, a situation that did not
constitute a lawful, non-conforming situation under the previously adopted
zoning ordinance does not achieve lawful nonconforming status under this
chapter merely by the repeal of the zoning ordinance.
1.15   Organization of the Unified Development Ordinance (UDO)
The Unified Development Ordinance, as established in this chapter, has been
developed in accordance with "Create the Vision," a Comprehensive Plan for the
purpose of promoting health, safety, and the general welfare of the community.
It is intended to consolidate—in one place and in logical order without
unnecessary duplication—all of the regulations pertaining to land use and
development. It is designed to make it possible for all of those concerned with
land use and development to have access to all city legislation with respect
thereto in one convenient document which is capable of being published and
distributed as a separate and comprehensive segment of the City code as a
whole.
   A.   Article 1, General Provisions, establishes the purpose of the UDO, the
authority to administer and enforce the UDO provisions, the relationship to
existing ordinances, and ordinance effective date.
   B.   Article 3, Administration, establishes the various administrative
agencies involved in the development approval process, as well as the role of
administrative and legislative bodies.
   C.   Article 5, Development Procedures, is designed to consolidate the
location of regulations governing the processing of permits for the development
of land. The purpose is to ensure that notification and procedures comply with
state enabling legislation, provide ample opportunity for public participation
in the land development process, provide for the efficient and timely
processing of development permits, and to promote the readability of the
document for the general public and for applicants requesting a permit.
   D.   Article 7, Districts and Use Standards, identifies the various
residential, commercial, industrial and planned districts and the uses
permitted within each district as well as the appropriate development
standards.
   E.   Article 9, Development Standards, consolidates the substantive
standards relating to the issuance of permits for zoning and subdivision
approval in order to provide clarity and certainty in the development approval
process.
   F.   Article 11, Definitions, is established in order to provide guidance to
readers of this code, while reserving the balance of the code for substantive
standards.
1.17   Relationship to Existing Ordinances and Rules of Construction (Ord. 4-
18)
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this UDO shall be
the minimum requirements, unless otherwise noted and shall be deemed neither to
limit nor repeal any other powers granted to the City under its Charter and
Ordinances or under State Statutes.
It is not intended by this Ordinance to repeal, abrogate, annul, or in any way
impair or interfere with any existing ordinances or provisions of law, or with
any rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law,
relating to the use of buildings and land, except as provided for in Section
1.11 herein.
Where this Ordinance imposes a greater restriction on the use of buildings or
premises, or on the heights of buildings, or requires larger yards, courts, or
other open spaces than are imposed or required by such existing provisions, the
provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail and control to the extent permitted
by law.
The UDO contains graphics, pictures, illustrations and drawings in order to
assist the reader in understanding and applying the regulations. However, to
the extent that there is any inconsistency between the text of this ordinance
and any such graphic, picture, illustration or drawing, the text shall control
unless otherwise provided in the specific section.
1.19   Relationship to Comprehensive Plan
The "Create the Vision" Comprehensive Plan for the City of Centerville, or
Comprehensive Plan as referenced in the UDO, consists of Volumes I, II, and
III, adopted on June 14, 2004, and as amended. It establishes the goals,
objectives and strategies that serve as a basis for the UDO. All regulations or
amendments adopted pursuant to this Ordinance shall be consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan as adopted and revised or updated. In cases of inconsistency
with other regulations or amendments, the UDO regulations shall prevail.
1.21   Conformance to Regulations
Except as specified herein, no land shall be subdivided, no building,
structure, premises, or part thereof shall be used, occupied, located, moved,
erected, constructed, reconstructed, converted, extended, enlarged, or altered
except in conformity and full compliance with the regulations herein specified
for the district in which it is located.
1.23   Establishment of Fees
City Council shall establish by ordinance a schedule of fees for all permits
and applications required by the UDO. In so doing, the City Council shall
consider the recommendations of the City Planner with respect to actual
administrative costs.  Fees shall increase 50% for repeat violations of Article
5.09(D), Certificates of Zoning Compliance. (Ord. 15-16)
1.25   Ordinance Separability
Each chapter, section, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or other divisible
part of the UDO is hereby declared to be severable. If any such chapter,
section, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or other divisible part of the
UDO is declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid (by any court of
competent jurisdiction in a valid judgment or decree), such unconstitutionality
or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining chapters, sections,
paragraphs, sentences, clauses, phrases, or other divisible parts of the UDO.

3.13   Nonconforming Uses, Lot, Setbacks, Structures and Land in Combination
   A.   Purpose:  Within the district established by this Ordinance,
nonconformances include lots, uses of land, structures, and structures and land
in combination that exist and were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or
amended, but would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of
this Ordinance.  The legitimate interest of those who lawfully established
these  nonconformities are recognized by providing for their continuance,
subject to regulations limiting their completion, restoration, reconstruction,
extension and/or substitution. Nothing contained in this Ordinance shall be
construed to require any change in the layout, plans, construction, size or use
of any lot, structure or structure and land in combination for which a zoning
permit became effective and does not lapse prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance. While it is the intent of this Ordinance that such nonconformities
be allowed to continue until removed, they should not be encouraged to
survive.  Nonconformity shall not be moved, extended, altered, expanded, or
used as grounds for any other use(s) or structure(s) prohibited elsewhere in
the district without the approval of the Planning Commission, except as
otherwise specifically provided for in this Ordinance.
   B.   Incompatibility of Nonconformities:  Nonconformities are declared by
this Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts in which
such uses are located. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use
of land or a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not
be extended or enlarged after passage of this Ordinance or by the addition of
other uses of a nature which would be generally prohibited in the district in
which such use is located.   
   C.   Avoidance of Undue Hardship:  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this
Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or
designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun
prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance and upon
which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual
construction is defined to include the placing of construction materials in
permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where demolition or
removal of an existing building has substantially begun preparatory to
rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction.    
   D.   Certificates of Nonconformance:  The City Planner may, upon his/her own
initiative, or shall upon the request of any owner, issue a zoning certificate
for any lot, structure, use of land, use of structure or use of land and
structure in combination, that certifies that the lot, structure or use is a
valid nonconforming use. The Certificate shall specify the reason why the use
is a valid nonconforming use, including a description of the extent and kind of
use made of the property in question, the portion of the structure or land used
for the nonconforming use, and the extent that dimensional requirements are
nonconforming. The purpose of this Section is to protect the owners of lands or
structures that are, or becoming, nonconforming. No fee shall be charged for
such a certificate. One (1) copy of the certificate shall be returned to the
owner and 1 copy shall be retained by the City Planner, who shall maintain, as
a public record, a file of all such nonconforming lots, structures, uses of
land, uses of structures, or uses of structures and land in combination.   
   E.   Substitution of Nonconforming Uses:  So long as no structural
alterations are made, except as required by enforcement of other codes or
ordinances, any nonconforming use may, upon appeal to and approval by Planning
Commission, be changed to another nonconforming use of the same classification
or of a less intensive classification, provided that Planning Commission shall
find that the use proposed for substitution is equally appropriate or more
appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting
such change, Planning Commission may require that additional conditions and
safeguards be met, which requirements shall pertain as stipulated conditions to
the approval of such change, and failure to meet such conditions shall be
considered a punishable violation of this Ordinance. Whenever a nonconforming
use has been changed to a less intensive use or becomes a conforming use, such
use shall not thereafter be changed to a more intensive use or other
nonconforming use.
   F.   Single Nonconforming Lots of Record:  In any district in which single-
family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance. Such lot must be in separate
ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.
This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements
for area or width, or both (that are generally applicable in the district),
provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to
area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which such lot is located.
   G.   Nonconforming Lots of Record in Combination:  If two (2) or more lots
or a combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in
single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this
Ordinance, and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Ordinance. No
portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes
compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this Ordinance,
nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with a width
or area below the requirements stated in this Ordinance.   
   H.   Nonconforming Uses of Land:  At the time of adoption of this Ordinance,
lawful uses of land exist which would not be permitted by the regulations
imposed by this Ordinance. These uses may be continued so long as they remain
otherwise lawful, provided:
      1.   No such nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance;
      2.   No such nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance;
      3.   If any such nonconforming uses of land are voluntarily discontinued
or abandoned for more than one (1) year (except when government action impedes
access to the premises), any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the
regulations specified by this Ordinance for the district in which such land is
located; and
      4.   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
Ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
      5.   A non-conforming recreational vehicle use of a premises shall be
lost if any of the following shall occur:
         a.   The use is discontinued for more than 6 months;
         b.   The non-conforming recreational vehicle is replaced.  Any
replacement recreational vehicle must conform to all of the requirements of
this UDO;
         c.   The ownership of the premises on which the non-conforming
recreational vehicle use exists is changed and no former owner remains an
owner; and
         d.   Eighteen months after the date of adoption of this Ordinance.
      6.   A non-conforming vehicle parking area use that is not graded and
constructed with a hard paved surface shall be lost 18 months after the date of
adoption of this Ordinance. (Ord. 17-14)
   I.   Nonconforming Structures:  Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance that could not be
built under the terms of this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot
coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, bulk or other requirements
concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      1.   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity;
      2.   Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a
structure be destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than 50 percent of
the cost of replacement at time of destruction of such structure, it shall not
be reconstructed except in conformity within the provision of this Ordinance;
and
      3.   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
   J.   Nonconforming Uses of Structures or of Structures and Land in
Combination:  If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of a
structure and land in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance that would not be allowed in the district under the
terms of this Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      1.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
Ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located;
      2.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building;
      3.   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not
thereafter be resumed;
      4.   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for more than 1 year (except when
government action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or structure
and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with
the regulations of the district in which it is located; and
      5.   When nonconforming use status is applied to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
   K.   Termination of Use through Discontinuance:  When any nonconforming use
is discontinued or abandoned for more than 1 year, any new use shall not
thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in
which it is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
The intent to continue a nonconforming use shall not be evidence of its
continuance. In the event that any nonconforming building or structure is
destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 50 percent of the cost of
replacement of such structure, exclusive of foundation, it shall not be
rebuilt, restored or reoccupied for any use unless it conforms to all
regulations of this Ordinance.
   L.   Repairs and Maintenance:  On any nonconforming structure or portion of
a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary
repairs, or on repair or replacement or non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or
plumbing, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming
shall not be increased. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official. Where appropriate, a building permit for
such activities shall be required.
3.15   Ordinance Enforcement and Penalties

   E.   Changes in Use:  A change in the use of a building or structure may be
approved by the City Planner if the use is substantially similar to the
existing use or another permitted use under the existing zoning district
classification as indicated on the Official Zoning Map. A change in use may or
may not involve interior or exterior building alterations. An application must
be filed.   
   F.   Conditional Use:  Conditional Uses are those uses that because of
special requirements or characteristics may be allowed in a particular zoning
district only after review by the Planning Commission and granting of
Conditional Use approval imposing such conditions as necessary to make the use
compatible with other uses permitted in the same district zone or vicinity. A
Conditional Use shall be allowed in a zoning district after permission is
granted by the City Council in accordance with the provisions of the UDO.    
      1.   Standards for Approval: The following standards shall be considered
in the review of Conditional Use Applications:
         a.   The Conditional Use is  a use that may be permitted with
conditions, in the District for which it is proposed;
         b.   The Conditional Use will be in accordance with the general
objectives, or with any specific objective, of the City's Comprehensive Plan or
this UDO;
         c.   The Conditional Use will be designed, constructed, operated, and
maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the
existing or intended character of the general vicinity and that such use will
not change the essential character of the same area;
         d.   The Conditional Use will not be hazardous or unreasonably disturb
existing or future neighboring uses;
         e.   The Conditional Use will be served adequately by essential public
facilities and services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection,

persons or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall
be able to adequately provide any such services;
         f.   The Conditional Use will not create excessive additional
requirements, at public cost, for public facilities and services and will not
be detrimental to the economic welfare of the community;
         g.   The Conditional Use will not involve uses, activities, processes,
materials, equipment and conditions or operations that will be detrimental to
any persons, property, or the general welfare by reason of excessive production
of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare negative appearance, or odors;
         h.   The Conditional Use will have vehicular approaches to the
property, which shall be designed so as not to interfere with traffic on
surrounding public thoroughfares; and,
         i.   The Conditional Use will not result in the destruction, loss or
damage of a natural, scenic, or historic feature of major importance.
      2.   The Planning Commission and City Council shall each hold a public
hearing on a Conditional Use in accordance with Section
5.06 D of this UDO.
      3.   A Conditional Use Certificate shall authorize a particular
conditional use on a specific parcel for which it was approved. The Conditional
Use Certificate is non-assignable and shall expire 1 year from the date of
enactment, unless prior to that date the applicant commences actual
construction or business. There shall be no modification of a conditional use
certificate except by Planning Commission.
   G.   Development Plan:  Approval of a Development Plan is required within
the Residential Planned Development (R-PD), Office Planned Development (O-PD),
Business Planned Development (B-PD), Industrial Planned Development (I-PD) and
the Overlay Districts. The two-step Development Plan review and approval
process includes submission of a Preliminary Development Plan and a Final
Development Plan. Depending on the scope and complexity of the project
proposed, the Planning Commission may permit the Preliminary Development Plan
and the Final Development Plan to be combined as one (1) submission. The TRC,
the Planning Commission and City Council review both plans. (Ord. 17-14,  16-
16)
      1.   Standards for Approval, Preliminary Development Plan (PDP). The
following standards shall be considered in the review of Preliminary
Development Plan applications: (Ord. 16-16, 5-18)
         a.   The PDP addresses the goals, objectives, and outcomes of the
City's Comprehensive Development Plan and other adopted plans of the City;
         b.   The PDP meets the purpose and general characteristics of the
substantive Planned District as described in Article 7.17;
         c.   The PDP addresses the impact of the project on other property or
other uses located on the same property;
         d.   The PDP addresses compatibility with development on nearby
property;
         e.   The PDP addresses safe conditions for pedestrians or motorists
and the prevention of dangerous arrangement of pedestrian and vehicular ways;
and

standards shall be considered in the review of Final Development Plan
applications: (Ord. 16-16, 5-18)
         a.   The FDP addresses the goals, objectives, and outcomes of the
City's Comprehensive Development Plan and other adopted plans of the City;
         b.   The FDP complies with the applicable requirements of the UDO;
         c.   The FDP adequately protects other property or other uses located
on the same property;
         d.   The FDP is compatible with other development on nearby property;
         e.   The FDP provides safe conditions for pedestrians or motorists and

circulation within the site, for emergency vehicles.
      3.   The Planning Commission and City Council shall each hold a public
hearing on a Development Plan in accordance with Section
5.06 (D) of this UDO. The Planning Commission serves as a recommending body to
the City Council for Development Plans. City Council serves as the final review
authority for all Development Plans. (Ord. 16-16)
      4.   Effect of Approval, Preliminary Development Plan: A Preliminary
Development Plan (PDP) approval by the City Council shall not constitute an
amendment to the Centerville Zoning Map. A PDP approval shall be valid for a
period of one (1) year to allow the official submittal of a Final Development
Plan. Unless the required Final Development Plan is properly submitted for
Planning Commission review within the one year period, the PDP approval shall
be voided unless an application for a time extension is submitted and approved
by City Council. (Ord. 16-16)
      5.   Effect of Approval, Final Development Plan: A Final Development Plan
(FDP) approval by the City Council shall constitute an amendment to the
Centerville Zoning Map as it applies to the land included in the approved
amendment for the appropriate Planned and Overlay Districts. In the event
zoning and building permits are not issued in association with an approved FDP
within two (2) years of approval, the FDP shall expire.  The expiration of an
FDP shall also result in the expiration of the associated PDP. Therefore the
land shall revert to its last previous zoning district, unless an application
for an extension is submitted and approved by City Council. Where conflicts
exist, the approved FDP shall supersede all previous PDP or FDP approvals. 
(Ord. 16-16)
   H.   Minor Modifications:  After the Major Site Plan has been approved by
Planning Commission or the Board of Architectural Review and prior to issuing a
Certificate of Occupancy, adjustments or rearrangements of buildings, drives,
parking areas, recreation areas, entrances, heights, yards, changes to the
exterior façade, or similar modifications, may be requested by the applicant.
The City Planner shall review such amendments to a major site plan if the
change involves 25 percent or less of the original gross floor area or lineal
dimension, or 1,000 square feet whichever is less.  Amendments to a major site
plan greater than this requirement shall be reviewed by the Planning
Commission.

difficulties unique to the property in question prevent full compliance with
such provisions.
   B.   Variance Process:  The Planning Commission has the authority to grant
variances. The Planning Commission may authorize, in specific cases, such
variance from the terms of this UDO as will not be contrary to the public
interest.   
      1.   Pre-application Meeting: The applicant may meet with the City
Planner prior to submitting a variance request for consideration by to the
Planning Commission. Following the conclusion of the meeting, the City Planner
shall forward to the applicant a written summary of the results of the pre-
application meeting including recommendations and all attached comments.
      2.   Preliminary Review by the City Planner: Upon receipt of an
application, the City Planner shall, within 5 days, review the application and
determine whether it provides all necessary and required information. If it is
incomplete, the City Planner shall advise the applicant of the deficiencies and
inform the applicant that no further action will be taken on the application
until all necessary and required information has been provided. If it is
complete, the City Planner may forward the application to the TRC.

public hearing in accordance with Article 5.06(D) of the UDO.
      5.   Planning Commission Action:  The Planning Commission may approve the
variance as requested; approve with modifications by the Planning Commission;
or deny the variance. The Planning Commission shall indicate the specific
reasons(s) for its recommendation.
      6.   Additional Conditions and Safeguards: The Planning Commission may
further prescribe any conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary to
ensure that the objectives of the regulations or provisions to which the
variance applies will be met.
   C.   Expiration of the Variance:  Variances shall expire one year from the
date of enactment, unless prior thereto the applicant applies for a building
permit in accordance with the granted variance. There shall be no modification
of variances except by further consideration of the Planning Commission.
Extension of variances, without modification, may be applied for prior to the
date of expiration, if the Variance does not carry a prohibition against the
extension. Extensions may be granted by the Planning Commission if it finds
that the requested extension is consistent with the purpose, policies, and
intent of the Community Plan, and the specifications of the UDO. Requests for
renewal of an expired Variance shall be considered to be the same as an
application for a Variance and shall meet all requirements for application and
review pursuant to Section
5.17.
   D.   Standards for Approval:  The following factors shall be considered and
weighed by the Planning Commission in determining practical difficulty or
hardship:
      1.   The granting of the Variance shall be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of the regulations imposed by this ordinance on the district
in which it is located, and shall not be injurious to the area or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare;
      2.   The granting of the Variance will not permit the establishment of
any use which is not otherwise permitted in the district;
      3.   There must exist unique circumstances or conditions applicable to
the land or buildings where strict application of this ordinance would deprive
the applicant reasonable use of his property. Mere loss in monetary value shall
not justify a Variance;
      4.   There must be proof of hardship resulting from the strict
application of this ordinance that was not created by the property owner.
Economic gain or profit is not sufficient proof that a Variance should be
granted;
      5.   The granting of the Variance is necessary for the reasonable use of
land or buildings and the variance as granted is the minimum Variance that will
accomplish this purpose;
      6.   The granting of the Variance will not infringe on the rights of
neighboring property owners to use their property, diminish property values,
endanger the public safety, or create a public nuisance; and
      7.   The granting of the Variance will not confer on the applicant any
special privilege that is denied by this ordinance to other lands, structures,
or buildings in the same zoning district.
      8.   See Section
9.37 W. for additional standards as they apply to a variance from the
Floodplain Design Standards.
   E.   Submittal Requirements:  An application for a Variance shall be filed
on a form provided by the City Planner, and shall be accompanied by the
following requirements:
      1.   Name, address, and phone number of applicant(s) and property owner
or designated agent;
      2.   Proof of ownership, legal interest or written authority;
      3.   Legal Description of property or portion thereof;

      5.   Narrative statements establishing and substantiating the
justification for the variance pursuant to Section
5.17(D);

9.07   Overlay Zoning District Standards
   A.   Mixed Use
      1.   Purpose
The Mixed-Use Overlay District is meant to encourage medium density mixed-use
development with a required above-grade residential or office component,
pedestrian-friendly site design, and an urban street character, in order to
increase pedestrian traffic, reduce vehicular traffic, promote innovative use
of space, promote energy efficient design, conserve land, and accommodate a
range of compatible land uses through appropriate site design. Mixed-Use
Overlay Districts are intended to provide areas in which a variety of housing
types exist among neighborhood-serving commercial and institutional uses and
employment opportunities. The Mixed-Use Overlay District encourages the
development of compact, pedestrian-scaled, mixed-use neighborhoods and
commercial centers. It is also intended to help advance revitalization
initiatives along commercial corridors and recognizes the market demand for new
residential and commercial development within compact, pedestrian friendly
districts. Mixed-Use zoning is intended to work in conjunction with the
proactive development of pocket parks and plazas, open spaces, and the creation
of public spaces within the districts. Mixed-Use zoning can support commercial
corridor redevelopment plans and urban design guidelines or standards that
require high quality development that is consistent with the character of the
district. It specifically discourages those uses that promote a strip center
development pattern, promote idle land and over parking, and detract from the
image enhancement intentions of this district. A Mixed-Use Overlay District may
overlay several base districts. The Mixed-Use Overlay Districts include:
Neighborhood Center District, Community Center District, the Corporate
Business  District.
      2.   Permitted Land Uses
The uses permitted in each underlying district are limited to the boundaries of
that district, and the regulations of the underlying district shall govern,
except where additional uses are expressly allowed under this Section. Table
9.2 lists the permitted land uses and building types by Overlay District.

         (3)   Surface parking areas shall not be within 50 feet of a street
intersection, as measured from the property line(s).
         (4)   Fueling islands and drive-up/through facilities including any
canopy shall not be located in a front yard. 
      3.   Rezoning and Development Review/Approval of Plans
Applications shall be processed in accordance with the same review and hearing
procedures as a proposal for a zoning district change, as described in Section
5.09, Development Plan. Mixed-Use Overlay District applications may be
submitted only if the project is located within the Mixed-Use Overlay District.
However, this mechanism is optional and shall not be required of all projects
located within the Mixed-Use Overlay District. Projects not being developed in
accordance with the Mixed-Use Overlay District standards shall be developed in
accordance with the development standards of the underlying base zoning
district.
      4.   Design Standards
This Section establishes design standards for development in Mixed-Use
Districts.  These standards shall apply to permitted uses in all Districts.
The design standards described in this subsection are intended to promote good
quality design in site development and new building construction within mixed-
use zoning designations.  Good design in mixed-use zones results in buildings
and dwellings visually compatible with one another and adjacent neighborhoods,
contributing to a district which is attractive, visually stimulating, active
and safe.  These qualities contribute to the creation of an environment which
facilitates easy pedestrian movement and a rich mixture of uses.  A diversity
of architectural styles is encouraged except in large scale mixed-use
developments where unified architectural and urban design is important to the
identity of the development project. All new development and expansions of
existing uses located in mixed-use districts shall comply with these design
standards during Development Review.
      5.   Building and Site Design Standards
The standards contained in this subsection are intended to encourage good
quality, pedestrian-sensitive design in new building construction. 
         a.   Building Entry and Orientation Requirements
      The purpose of this subsection is to require buildings and entrances to
be oriented to the street to the maximum extent practicable to encourage
pedestrian access and movement.  Requirements for orientation and primary
entrances are intended to provide for convenient, direct and accessible
pedestrian routes to and from public sidewalks; provide for safe, pleasant and
convenient pedestrian circulation by connecting activities within a structure
to the adjacent sidewalk and to nearby transit stops where available; and
promote the use of pedestrian modes of transportation to retail and commercial
facilities.
      The following design standards shall apply to development in NC, CC, and
CB Districts except where noted:
            i.   All ground-floor tenant spaces with at least 25 feet of
frontage facing a public or private street shall have at least one building
entrance oriented to the adjacent street.  Such an entrance shall open directly
to the outside and shall not require a pedestrian to first pass through a
garage, parking lot or loading area to gain access to the entrance from the
street, but the entrance may include architectural features such as arcades,
anti-chambers, porticos and the like without being in violation of this
provision.
            ii.   If a building has frontage on more than one street, the
building shall provide a main building entrance oriented to one of the streets
or a single entrance to the corner where the two streets intersect.
            iii.   Where one single tenant has 200 feet or more of frontage on
a pubic or private street, one additional entrance shall be provided for each
200 feet of frontage on one of the public or private streets.
            iv.   Freestanding banking institutions and restaurants located in
the CB District are exempt from the provisions contained in this subsection and
may locate the primary building entrance on any façade of the structure.
            v.   A clear internal site pedestrian sidewalk or pathway shall be
provided to the building entrance from all public or private street sidewalks. 
A building may have more building entrances than required by this Section
oriented to a public or private street, and may have secondary entrances facing
off-street parking areas and loading areas.
            vi.   An exception to the requirement of paragraph (a) above shall
be allowed upon finding that:
               1)   The slope of the land between the building and the street
is greater than 1:12 for more than 20 feet and a more accessible pedestrian
route to the building is available from a different side of the building;
               2)   The land between the building and the street contains a
natural resource which would be unavoidably and irreparably degraded by
providing a reasonably direct pedestrian connection and an alternative route
without such impacts is available; or
               3)   The land between the building and the street contains
mature, healthy trees of greater than 8" caliper which would be unavoidably
destroyed or damaged by any reasonably direct routing of a pedestrian
connection and an alternative route without such impacts is available.
            vii.   Residential dwellings fronting on a public or private street
shall have a main entrance to the dwelling opening onto the front of the
dwelling at the ground floor level.  Such an entrance shall open directly to
the outside and shall not require passage through a garage to gain access to
the doorway.  The doorway may be above final grade where a porch, stoop,
portico, anti-chamber, wheelchair ramp or similar architectural feature is
included in the design.  Ground floor single-family attached and row/townhouse
residential units fronting on a public or private street shall have separate
entries directly from the major pedestrian route.  Ground floor and upper story
residential units in a multi-family building fronting on a public or private
street may share one or more entries accessible directly from the street.
            viii.   Residential building facades over 150 feet in length facing
a street shall provide two or more main building entrances.
            ix.   Entryways into a mixed-use building containing residential
units shall be clearly marked with a physical feature incorporated into the
building or an appropriately scaled element applied to the façade.
         b.   Ground Floor Windows and Building Façade Requirements
      Long expanses of blank walls facing a street or other public areas
detract from the attractiveness of the streetscape and perceived safety of
pedestrians using those spaces.  The standards of this subsection are intended
to enhance street safety and provide a comfortable street environment by
providing ground-level features of interest to pedestrians along streets. 
These standards also have the purpose of encouraging surveillance opportunities
where buildings face abutting streets and public areas, preventing fortress-
like facades, and avoiding a monotonous pedestrian environment.  The standards
also help enhance the economic vitality of a neighborhood by providing the
opportunity for merchants to display goods and advertise their wares to
shoppers by encouraging "window shopping" in mixed-use districts the activity
on the street is increased along with security.
      The following design standards shall apply to development in NC, CC, and
CB Districts
            i.   All development shall provide ground floor windows on the
building façade facing and adjacent to a public street, or facing onto a park,
plaza or other public outdoor space. Required windows shall allow views into
lobbies or similar areas of activity, pedestrian entrances, or display
windows.  Required windows shall provide a lower sill no more than three feet
above grade; except where interior floor levels prohibit such placement, the
sill may be located not less than two feet above the finished floor level to a
maximum sill height of 5 feet above exterior grade.
            ii.   Darkly tinted windows and mirrored windows which block two
way visibility are prohibited as ground floor windows required under this
provision except where the closest face of the building to the nearest edge of
the sidewalk within a public right-of-way or private street parallel and
adjacent to the building is greater than 50 feet.
            iii.   In all districts, building frontages along streets shall
break any flat, monolithic facade by including architectural elements such as
bay windows, recessed entrances or other articulation so as to provide
pedestrian scale to the first floor frontage.
            iv.   Where ground floor windows are required by this section on
multi-family, apartment, public institutional and a commercial structure, any
exterior wall facing a public street, public open space, pedestrian walkway
and/or transit station shall have windows, display areas or doorways for at
least 50 percent of the length and 50 percent of the area of the ground level
wall area, which is defined as the area up to the finished ceiling height of
the fronting space or 15 feet above finished grade, whichever is less.
            v.   On a single-family detached residence or a townhome (single-
family attached), any exterior wall facing a public street, public open space,
pedestrian walkway and/or transit station shall have windows, display areas or
doorways for at least 20 percent of the ground level wall area, which is
defined as the area up to the finished ceiling height of the fronting space or
15 feet above finished grade, whichever is less.
         c.   Architectural Design Requirements
      Good design results in buildings visually compatible with one another and
adjacent neighborhoods, contributing to mixed-use areas which are attractive,
stimulating, active and safe.
      The following design requirements shall apply to development in NC, CC,
and CB Districts:
            i.   Buildings shall promote and enhance a pedestrian scale and
orientation on the facade facing the public street. Street-side building
facades and dwelling units within all Mixed-Use Districts shall be varied and
articulated to provide visual interest to pedestrians and avoid a flat
appearance. In addition, development proposals shall make provisions and
include designs consistent with the following:
               1)   All new commercial, public/institutional, mixed use, and
residential buildings constructed within a Mixed-Use District shall demonstrate
during the Development Review process that it promotes and enhances a
pedestrian scale and orientation on any façade facing a public or private
street and it incorporates discernible and architecturally appropriate
features; such as, but not limited to, cornices, bases, fenestration, fluted
masonry, bays, recesses, arcades, display windows, unique entry areas or other
treatments for visual interest, to create community character and to promote a
sense of pedestrian scale. The design shall recognize that the simple relief
provided by window cutouts or sills on an otherwise flat façade, in and of
themselves, does not meet the requirements of this subsection; and
               2)   All residential dwellings, of any type, constructed within
any Mixed-Use District shall be constructed with exterior building materials
and finishes of high quality to convey an impression of permanence and
durability. Materials such as, and including, masonry, stucco, stone, terra
cotta, tile, cedar shakes and shingles, beveled or ship-lap or other narrow-
course horizontal boards or siding, articulated architectural concrete masonry
units (CMU), and similar durable architectural materials are allowed. 
Materials such as, and including, T-111 siding, plain or plain painted plywood
and strandboard sheets, concrete or cinder block, smooth surface concrete
panels, and similar quality and non-durable material are prohibited.
            ii.   Commercial buildings and sites shall be organized to group
the utilitarian functions away from the public view.  Delivery and loading
operations, heating, ventilating and cooling (HVAC) equipment, trash compacting
and collection, and other utility and service functions shall be incorporated
into the overall design of the building(s) and the landscaping. The visual and
acoustic impacts of these functions, along with all wall or ground-mounted
mechanical, electrical and communications equipment shall be out of view from
adjacent properties and public streets, and screening materials and landscape
screens shall be architecturally compatible with and not inferior to the
principal materials of the building and primary landscaping. The visual and
acoustic aspects of roof-mounted equipment, vents and chimneys shall be
minimized by placing equipment behind parapets, within architectural screening,
roof-top landscaping, or by using other aesthetically pleasing methods of
screening and deadening the sound of such equipment.
         d.   Location and Design of Off-Street Parking
      Parking should be located and designed so as to not only facilitate its
major function but also to complement and encourage easy and safe pedestrian
movement to, through and around the facility.  The scale and orientation of
parking areas shall be consistent with their purposes in supporting a mix of
commercial and residential uses and shall be consistent with the pedestrian-
and transit-oriented community to which they contribute.  Except as expressly
modified below, the parking design standards contained in Section
9.29 shall apply. The following additional standards shall apply only within
Mixed-Use Districts:
            i.   No surface parking or maneuvering area shall be located
between the facing façade of an adjacent building (or a line extended from the
plane thereof) and a public or private street where a maximum setback is
prescribed by this Section. Service docks and loading areas may be located
between a building and public or private street when an anchor tenant requires
the use of delivery vehicles with an overall length of 40 feet or greater and
where the service docks and loading areas comply with the provisions contained
in Section
9.29, Parking and Loading.
            ii.   To create pedestrian interest, maneuvering areas, service
docks, and loading areas shall be located interior to the site wherever
practicable. Where locations of these facilities on the site are in the public
view, adjacent to a street, driveway, or pedestrian route and cannot be
avoided, exterior building walls or screen walls for such facilities shall
include decorative elements that provide visual (pedestrian) interest such as
openings with decorative grates, artwork, and decorative tiles.  Screening
walls surrounding service docks and loading areas shall be a minimum of 12 feet
in height.  Windows and display area are not required on walls surrounding
service docks and loading areas.
            iii.   Bicycle parking spaces shall be sited so as not to occupy
space within, reduce the size of, or impede the use of required sidewalks,
pedestrian ways, curbside landscape strips, landscape buffers or usable open
spaces. All bicycle parking must be easily accessible and shall be equipped or
located so as to allow the bicycle to be conveniently and securely locked to a
parking device or within a secured bicycle parking area.  Covered bicycle
parking shall provide security and protection from the weather.  Covered
parking may be provided within a parking structure, garage, under a separate
roof, within a bicycle locker, or in a designated area within a building or
residential complex.  Except in single-family detached and duplex dwelling
units, allowance for required bicycle parking within an individual residence is
not considered to be in compliance with this requirement.
            iv.   Surface parking areas shall provide perimeter parking lot
landscaping adjacent to a street other than a major pedestrian route which
meets one of the following standards:
               1)   A 5 foot wide planting strip between the right-of-way and
the parking area shall be provided for streets designated as alley. A 10 foot
wide planting strip between the right-of-way and parking area shall be provided
for streets designated as boulevards, commercial streets, and neighborhood
streets. The planting strip may be pierced by pedestrian-accessible and
vehicular accessways.  Planting strips shall be planted with large-scale, high
canopy, horizontally-branching street tree species and/or an evergreen hedge. 
Hedges shall be no less than 30 inches or more than 42 inches in height. 
Hedges and other landscaping shall be planted and maintained to afford adequate
sight distance for vehicles exiting the parking lot.
               2)   In lieu of hedges specified in subsection d.1, decorative
walls or fences not to exceed 42 inches in height parallel to and not nearer
than 2 feet from the right-of-way line may be utilized. The area between the
wall or fence and the back of the sidewalk shall be landscaped. The required
wall or screening shall be designed to allow for access to the site and
sidewalk by pedestrians and shall be constructed and maintained to afford
adequate sight distance as described above for vehicles exiting the parking
lot.
            v.   Surface parking areas shall provide interior landscaping which
meets the following standards: If these standards conflict with the standards
in Section
9.29 the more restrictive standards should apply.
               1)   Angled or perpendicular parking spaces shall provide, where
needed, full depth curbing, wheel stops, widened curbs or widened sidewalks to
prevent bumper overhang into landscape areas or walkways.
               2)   All surface parking facilities shall include landscaping
along the perimeter of the lot to a depth of at least 45 feet. Perimeter
landscaping shall not be required where two parking lots using a common
driveway are joined by a common circulation aisle or other traffic area, and
landscaping may be reduced or eliminated adjacent to landscaped open space in
order to transition the open space landscaping into the parking area and afford
better access between the two areas.  Landscaping shall also be installed
within planting bays, and in any other area where parking stalls, circulation
aisles, driveways, or pedestrian movements would not be precluded by the
landscaping. The minimum amount of required landscaping is 10 percent of the
area devoted to outdoor parking facilities. All landscaping required under the
provisions of this subsection may be applied towards compliance with other
applicable landscaping requirements.
               3)   A minimum of one three-inch  caliper street tree shall be
provided in protected planting bays located within the surface parking area at
the end of each parking row and at intervals not exceeding 100 feet within the
parking rows.  Planting bays shall have a minimum width of five feet and a
minimum area of 185 square feet for double loaded parking bays and 90 square
feet for single loaded parking bays. The remainder of each bay shall be
landscaped in a manner consistent with the provisions of this subsection.
               4)   All parking lot construction, internal walkways, markings
and access shall meet and fully comply with the requirements of the Americans
with Disabilities Act.
            vi.   Except in residential areas, parking associated with new
development shall be designed to the extent practicable to connect with auto
parking areas on adjacent sites to eliminate the necessity of utilizing the
street for parallel movements.
            vii.   General Landscaping Standards for Off-Street Parking Areas.
               1)   The minimum planting size for all required trees shall be
2½ inch caliper as measured by American Association of Nurserymen standards. 
Trees shall be deciduous shade trees capable of at least 35 feet in height and
spread at maturity.
               2)   A minimum of 70 percent of all required landscaped areas,
including required planting strips and planting bays, shall be covered with
trees, or shrubs.  All areas shall also include continuous ground cover
consisting of lawn, low growing evergreen shrubs, or evergreen ground cover.
               3)   Evergreen shrubs shall be not less than 2 feet higher than
the finished grade at the time of planting.  Evergreen shrubs shall be of the
type that grows to be at least 36 inches higher than finished grade.
            viii.   All curb cuts are subject to approval based on standards to
ensure safe pedestrian circulation, traffic flow, access points needed for the
proper functioning of the development and the objectives of this Section.  To
meet these standards, consolidation of curb cuts may be a condition of
development approval.
         e.   Requirements for Drive-Through Facilities
   Where drive-through facilities are permitted in the Mixed-Use Districts the
following standards shall apply:
            i.   Drive-through service lanes shall be located in the side yard
or rear yard.  The Planning Commission may approve a drive-through service lane
in the front yard for a corner lot or through lot where the configuration of
such lot precludes its placement in the side or rear yard.
            ii.   A drive-through lane located in the front yard shall be
buffered by evergreen shrubs. The shrubs shall be not less than two feet higher
than finished grade at the time of planting.  Evergreen shrubs shall be of the
type that grows to be at least 36 inches higher than finished grade.
         f.   Requirements for Improvements Between Streets and Buildings
   Landscaping or "hardscaping" of property between the street curb and
buildings promotes and enhances a comfortable pedestrian scale and orientation
and encourages pedestrian use of the area.  The following street design
standards shall apply to development in NC, CC, and CB Districts:
            i.   The property between the street curb and an adjacent building
shall be landscaped or hardscaped.  Landscaping shall be irrigated.
            ii.   Where a hard-surfaced area, other than a pedestrian
connection leading from the sidewalk to a building entrance, is used in lieu of
landscaping between the sidewalk and the building, such areas shall contain at
least two pedestrian-sensitive amenities. Such amenities include, but are not
limited to, benches, low walls with seating or planters atop, drinking
fountains, courtyards, free-standing planters, street furniture, public art or
other pedestrian space or design features integrated into the overall design of
the building or portion of the site in order to enhance the pedestrian
environment. Single-family detached dwellings are excluded from this
requirement.
            iii.   Trees selected from the City's approved street tree list.
Trees may be within tree wells with a minimum planting area of 15 square feet
(with standard 3' x 5', 4' x 4' or 4' diameter cast iron grates). Such trees
shall be planted every 30 feet on center (or, depending on species, at some
other distance to ensure their proper spacing) so as to develop a continuous
canopy when mature. Street trees shall be at least 2 and ½ inches in caliper at
planting, shall be planted within an approved root barrier, and shall be
irrigated and maintained by the property owner along with other landscaping
planted within the parking strip.
            iv.   Topping, shearing or pollarding of street trees is
prohibited, unless necessary to protect overhead utility lines.
            v.   Except as noted below, all public utility distribution and
service connections to new buildings and dwellings within all Mixed-Use
Districts shall be underground. Aerial utility service (electricity, telephone,
cable, etc.) may be used in new construction where all of the following
circumstances apply:
               1)   The project is an in-fill building or dwelling within an
existing neighborhood where utility service is provided aerially rather than
underground;
               2)   The project is located between other utility users on the
same block front;
               3)   It would not be practicable to serve the new project
underground without also serving the neighboring uses; and
               4)   The neighboring uses on the same block front and the
utility company are unwilling to pay the additional cost of placing service
underground.
            vi.   Ornamental street lights shall be installed when public
right-of-way improvements are required as a part of a development.
            vii.   Bulb-outs, or curb extensions, shall be constructed at all
intersections of public streets when public right-of-way improvements are
required as a part of a development.  The design of the bulb-outs shall be
approved by the City Engineer.
         g.   Civic Spaces
   Civic spaces, including neighborhood parks, greens, squares, plazas and
playgrounds, must be an integral part of a mixed-use development. These spaces
must be designed and configured to be clearly recognizable as public open
space. Civic spaces should be located so that building walls having at least 15
percent of their area in transparent windows will face the space to make the
space safer for the pubic. Each civic space must have at least 50 percent of
its perimeter and at least two sides directly adjoining a public street. The
combined area of all civic spaces must be at least three but no more than seven
percent of the site's total acreage.
      6.   Lot and Building Types
Each mixed-use development should contain a variety of building types.
Differing building and lot types may be placed back-to-back, on a single block
to provide to provide transitions between lot types. Lot types should be
selected to provide buildings of like scale and massing on opposite sides of
the street. The following building and lot types shall be permitted and are
further illustrated in Exhibits 9.0 thru 9.13:
      7.   Permitted Street Types
Each mixed-use development should provide an interconnected network of streets,
alleys, lanes or other passageways. The following street types shall be
permitted and are further illustrated in Exhibits 9.14 thru 9.19.
   B.   Neighborhood Residential
      1.   Purpose
The purpose of this ordinance is to allow the optional development and
redevelopment of land consistent with the design principles of traditional
neighborhoods. A Neighborhood Residential Development:
         a.   Is compact;
         b.   Is designed for the human scale;
         c.   Provides a mix of uses, including residential, commercial, civic,
and open space uses in close proximity to one another within the neighborhood;
         d.   Provides a mix of housing styles, types, and sizes to accommodate
households of all ages, sizes, and incomes;
         e.   Incorporates a system of relatively narrow, interconnected
streets with sidewalks, bikeways that offer multiple routes for motorists,
pedestrians, and bicyclists and provides for the connections of those streets
to existing and future developments;
         f.   Retains existing buildings with historical features or
architectural features that enhance the visual character of the community; and
         g.   Incorporates significant environmental features into the design.
      2.   Applicability
The Neighborhood Residential development standards may be applied to:
         a.   New development of 15 acres or more of land at any locus within
the Neighborhood Residential overlay area; or,
         b.   Ten acres or more of land contiguous to existing development at
any locus within the Neighborhood Residential overlay area; or,
         c.   Redevelopment or infill development within areas designated for
Neighborhood Residential Centers
The Neighborhood Residential District is established through rezoning and only
in conjunction with base zoning districts. Letters, numbers, or a combination
thereof, shall be combined with other applicable district designations to the
property(ies) on which an overlay district is established. Except as modified
by the overlay zoning district, the provisions of the applicable base-zoning
district shall apply to all development within the boundary of the designated
area. If regulations conflict, the applicable overlay zoning district
regulations shall prevail.
      3.   Rezoning and Development Review/Approval of Plans
Applications shall be processed in accordance with the same review and hearing
procedures and development review procedures as a proposal for a zoning
district change, as described in Section
5.09, Site Plan-Major. Neighborhood Residential District applications may be
submitted only if the project is located within the Neighborhood Residential
District. However, this mechanism is optional and shall not be required of all
projects located within the Neighborhood Residential District. Projects not
being developed in accordance with the Neighborhood Residential District
standards shall be developed in accordance with the development standards of
the underlying base zoning district.
      4.   Design Standards
         a.   Mix of Uses.
   In order to achieve the proximity necessary to make neighborhoods walkable,
it is important to mix land uses. A Neighborhood Residential District should
consist of a mix of residential uses, a community center, and open space as
listed below:
            i.   Residential uses. The following types can occur anywhere
within the Neighborhood Residential development. For infill development, the
mix of residential uses may be satisfied by existing residential uses adjacent
to the Neighborhood Residential Development.
               1)   Single-family detached dwellings;
               2)   Single-family attached dwellings, including duplexes,
townhomes, or row houses;
               3)   Multifamily dwellings, including senior housing;
               4)   Accessory dwelling units within a single-family unit.
            ii.   Community Center, composed of a mix of commercial,
residential, civic or institutional, and open space uses as identified below.
The project dimensions should be organized so that residential blocks are
within approximately 1/4 mile from the Community Center.
               1)   Commercial Uses in the Community Center. Individual
businesses should not exceed 5,000 square feet in size, but may be larger for
specialty and bulk sales stores. In addition, the following active, pedestrian-
oriented uses are desired:
                  a.   Food services (neighborhood grocery stores; butcher
shops; bakeries; restaurants, not including drive-throughs; cafes; coffee
shops; neighborhood bars or pubs);
                  b.   Retail uses (florists or nurseries; hardware stores;
stationery stores; book stores; studios and shops of artists and artisans);
                  c.   Services (day care centers; music, dance or exercise
studios; offices, including professional and medical offices; barber; hair
salon; dry cleaning);
                  d.   Accommodations (bed and breakfast establishments, small
hotels or inns).
               2)   Residential Uses in the Community Center
                  a.   Single-family attached dwellings, including duplexes,
townhomes or rowhouses;
                  b.   Multifamily dwellings, including senior housing;
                  c.   Residential units located on upper floors above
commercial uses or to the rear of storefronts;
                  d.   "Live/work" units that combine a residence and the
resident's workplace;
                  e.   "Special needs" housing, such as community living
arrangements and assisted living facilities.
               3)   Civic or Institutional Uses in the Community Center
                  a.   Municipal offices, fire stations, libraries, museums,
community meeting facilities, and post offices;
                  b.   Transit shelters;
                  c.   Places of worship;
                  d.   Educational facilities.
               4)   Open Space Uses in the Community Center
                  a.   Central square;
                  b.   Neighborhood park;
                  c.   Playground.
            In addition to the open spaces within the Community Center, open
spaces shall be incorporated elsewhere in the Neighborhood Residential
District.
         b.   Lot and Building Types
   The following lot and building types permitted in the Neighborhood
Residential District are further illustrated in Exhibits 9.0 through 9.13 and
include:
            i.   Single-Family House
            ii.   Single-Family House – Sideyard
            iii.   Single-Family House - Manor
            iv.   Single-Family House – Estate
            v.   Single-Family House – Neo-Traditional
            vi.   Townhome A
            vii.   Townhome B
            viii.   Two-Family Duplex
            ix.   Multi-Family
            x.   Live-Work
            xi.   Neighborhood Scale Retail
            xii.   Neighborhood Scale Office
            xiii.   Neighborhood Scale Mixed-Use
         c.   Street Types
   The following street types permitted in the Neighborhood Residential
District are further illustrated in Exhibits 9.14 though 9.19 and include:
            i.   Trail
            ii.   Path
            iii.   Alley
            iv.   Boulevard
            v.   Neighborhood Street
            vi.   Commercial Street (only in Community Center area)
         d.   Compact Design
   In order to create a compact design, the following standards of density and
dimensions will be included in any Neighborhood Residential development
proposal.
            i.   Open Space. At least 15 percent of the gross acreage of the
Neighborhood Residential development must be open space. At least 25 percent of
the open space must be common open space dedicated to the public for parkland.
Ninety percent of the lots within the areas devoted to residential uses shall
be within a ¼ mile from common open space. Large outdoor recreation areas
should be located at the periphery of neighborhoods rather than central
locations.
            ii.   Residential Units. The number of residential dwelling units
and the amount of nonresidential development (excluding open spaces) shall be
determined as follows:
               1)   In areas devoted to Residential uses:
                  a.   The number of single-family attached and detached units
permitted shall be 2.5 dwelling units per net acre;
                  b.   The number of multi-family units shall be 14 dwelling
units per net acre.
                  c.   Accessory dwelling units shall be permissible in
addition to the number of dwelling units authorized under this section.
However, the total number of accessory dwelling units shall not be more than 10
percent of the total number of single-family attached and detached units.
               2)   In Community Center areas:
                  a.   The number of single-family and multi-family dwelling
units permitted shall be calculated the same as above plus an additional number
of units not to exceed 10 percent of the amount permitted above.
                  b.   All dwelling units constructed above commercial uses
shall be permissible in addition to the number of dwelling units authorized
under this section. However, the total number of dwelling units shall not be
increased by more than 10 dwelling units or 10 percent, whichever is greater.
            iii.   Commercial Space. The total ground floor area of
nonresidential development uses, including off-street parking areas, shall not
exceed 25 percent of the Neighborhood Residential development.
            iv.   Lot and Block Standards.
               1)   Block and lot size diversity. Street layouts should provide
for development blocks that are generally in the range of 200-400 feet deep by
400-800 feet long. A variety of lot sizes should be provided that allow diverse
housing choices.
               2)   Lot Width. Lot widths should create a relatively
symmetrical street cross section that reinforces the public space of the street
as a simple, unified public space.
               3)   Lot Orientation. Lot design should allow for passive solar
designs for buildings. Typically this will place longer walls along an east-to-
west axis.
            v.   Building Setbacks.
               1)   Building Setback, Front – Community Center Area. Structures
in the Community Center area have no minimum setback. Commercial and civic or
institutional buildings should abut the sidewalks in the Community Center area.
               2)   Building Setback, Front - Residential. Single-family
detached residences shall have a building setback as a 15' to 25' build to zone
in the front. Single-family attached residences and multifamily residences
shall have a building setback as a build to zone in the front between 0 and 15
feet.
               3)   Building Setback, Rear - Residential. The principal
building on lots devoted to single-family detached residences shall be setback
no less than 30 feet from the rear lot line.
               4)   Side Setbacks. Provision for single-family sideyard lot
should be made, provided that a reciprocal access easement is recorded for both
lots and townhouses or other attached dwellings, provided that all dwellings
have pedestrian access to the rear yard through means other than the principal
structure.
         e.   Architectural Standards.
   A variety of architectural features and building materials is encouraged to
give each building or group of buildings a distinct character.
            i.   Guidelines for Existing Structures
         Any structure designated as a landmark shall be protected from
demolition or encroachment by incompatible structures or landscape development.
The U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic
Properties shall be used as the criteria for renovating historic or
architecturally significant structures.
            ii.   Guidelines for New Structures
               1)   Height. New structures within a Neighborhood Residential
development shall be no more than three stories for single-family residential,
or five stories for commercial, multifamily residential, or mixed use.
               2)   Entries and Facades
                  a.   The architectural features, materials, and the
articulation of a facade of a building shall be continued on all sides visible
from a public street or courtyard.
                  b.   The front facade of the principal building on any lot in
a Neighborhood Residential development shall face onto a public street.
                  c.   The front facade shall not be oriented to face directly
toward a parking lot.
                  d.   Porches, roof overhangs, or other similar architectural
elements shall define the front entrance to all residences.
                  e.   For commercial buildings, a minimum of 50 percent of the
front facade on the ground floor shall be transparent, consisting of window or
door openings allowing views into and out of the interior. New structures on
opposite sides of the same street should follow similar design guidelines. This
provision shall not apply to buildings bordering civic uses.
            iii.   Garages and Accessory Dwelling Units: Garages and accessory
dwelling units may be placed on a single-family detached residential lot within
the principal building or an accessory building provided that the accessory
dwelling unit shall not exceed 500 square feet.
            iv.   Exterior signage: Sign standards applicable to the underlying
base district standards shall apply unless otherwise modified by this section. 
A comprehensive sign program is required for the entire Neighborhood
Residential development to establish a uniform theme. Signs shall share a
common style (e.g., size, shape, material). In the mixed-use area, signs shall
be either a wall or a projecting sign.  Ground mounted signs shall be
prohibited.  A projecting sign shall be mounted perpendicular to the building
face and shall not exceed eight square feet. A wall sign shall be sized and
placed to fit within the architectural elements.
         f.   Circulation Standards
   The circulation system shall provide for different modes of transportation.
The circulation system shall provide functional links within the Residential
areas, Community Center area, and open space and shall be connected to existing
and proposed external development. The circulation system shall provide
adequate traffic capacity, provide connected pedestrian and bicycle routes
(especially off street bicycle or multi-use paths or bicycle lanes on the
streets), limit access onto streets of lower traffic volume classification, and
promote safe and efficient mobility through the Neighborhood Residential
development.
            i.   Pedestrian Circulation. Convenient pedestrian circulation
systems that minimize pedestrian-motor vehicle conflicts shall be provided
continuously throughout the Neighborhood Residential development. Where
feasible, any existing pedestrian routes through the site shall be preserved
and enhanced. All streets, except for alleys, shall be bordered by sidewalks on
both sides. The following provisions also apply:
               1)   Residential Sidewalks. Clear and well-lighted sidewalks,
five feet in width, shall connect all dwelling entrances to the adjacent public
sidewalk.
               2)   Community Center Sidewalks. Clear and well-lit walkways
shall connect building entrances to the adjacent public sidewalk and to
associated parking areas.
               3)   Disabled Accessibility. Sidewalks shall comply with the
applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
               4)   Crosswalks. Intersections of sidewalks with streets shall
be designed with clearly defined edges. Crosswalks shall be well lit and
clearly marked with contrasting paving materials at the edges or with striping.
            ii.   Bicycle Circulation. Bicycle circulation shall be
accommodated on streets and/or on dedicated bicycle paths. Where feasible, any
existing bicycle routes through the site shall be preserved and enhanced.
Facilities for bicycle travel may include off-street bicycle paths (generally
shared with pedestrians and other non motorized users) and separate, striped,
4-foot bicycle lanes on streets. If a bicycle lane is combined with a lane for
parking, the combined width shall be 14 feet.
            iii.   Public Transit Access. Where public transit service is
available or planned, convenient access to transit stops shall be provided.
Where transit shelters are provided, they shall be placed in highly visible
locations that promote security through surveillance, and shall be well-
lighted.
            iv.   Motor Vehicle Circulation. Motor vehicle circulation shall be
designed to minimize conflicts with pedestrians and bicycles. Traffic calming
features such as "queuing streets," curb extensions, traffic circles, and
medians may be used to encourage slow traffic speeds.
            v.   Street Hierarchy. Each street within a Neighborhood
Residential development shall be classified according to the following
(arterial streets should not bisect a Neighborhood Residential development):
               1)   Collector. This street provides access to commercial or
mixed-use buildings, but it is also part of the City's major street network.
On-street parking, whether diagonal or parallel, helps to slow traffic.
Additional parking is provided in lots to the side or rear of buildings. This
type of street includes the Commercial Street and Boulevard as illustrated in
Exhibit 9.18 and 9.19.
               2)   Sub-collector. This street provides primary access to
individual residential properties and connects streets of lower and higher
function. Design speed is 25 mph. This type of street includes the Neighborhood
Street as illustrated in Exhibit 9.17.
               3)   Local Street. This street provides primary access to
individual residential properties. Traffic volumes are relatively low, with a
design speed of 25 mph. This type of street includes the Neighborhood Street as
illustrated in Exhibit 9.17.
               4)   Alley. These streets provide secondary access to
residential properties where street frontages are narrow, where the street is
designed with a narrow width to provide limited on-street parking, or where
alley access development is desired to increase residential densities. Alleys
may also provide delivery access or alternate parking access to commercial
properties. This type of street includes the Alley as illustrated in Exhibit
9.16.
            vi.   Street Layout. The Neighborhood Residential development
should maintain the existing street grid, where present, and restore any
disrupted street grid where feasible. In addition:
               1)   Intersections shall be at right angles whenever possible,
but in no case less than 75 degrees. Low volume streets may form three-way
intersections creating an inherent right-of-way assignment (the through street
receives precedence), which significantly reduces accidents without the use of
traffic controls.
               2)   Corner Radii. The roadway edge at street intersections
shall be rounded by a tangential arc with a maximum radius of 15 for local
streets and 20 feet for intersections involving collector or arterial streets.
The intersection of a local street and an access lane or alley shall be rounded
by a tangential arc with a maximum radius of 10 feet.
               3)   Curb Cuts. Curb cuts for driveways to individual
residential lots shall be prohibited along arterial streets. Curb cuts shall be
limited to intersections with other streets or access drives to parking areas
for commercial, civic or multifamily residential uses. Clear sight triangles
shall be maintained at intersections unless controlled by traffic signal
devices:
               4)   Street Orientation. The orientation of streets should
enhance the visual impact of common open spaces and prominent buildings, create
lots that facilitate passive solar design, and minimize street gradients. All
streets shall terminate at other streets or at public land, except local
streets may terminate in stub streets when such streets act as connections to
future phases of the development. Local streets may terminate other than at
other streets or public land when there is a connection to the pedestrian and
bicycle path network at the terminus.
            vii.   Parking requirements. Parking areas for shared or community
use should be encouraged. In addition:
               1)   In the mixed-use area, any parking lot shall be located at
the rear or side of a building. If located at the side, screening shall be
provided as specified in Section
9.29.
               2)   A parking lot may not be adjacent to or opposite a street
intersection.
               3)   In the mixed-use area, a commercial use must provide three
parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross building area.
               4)   Parking lots or garages must provide not less than one
bicycle parking space for every 10 motor vehicle parking spaces.
               5)   Adjacent on-street parking may apply toward the minimum
parking requirements.
               6)   In the mixed residential areas, parking may be provided on-
site. Parking on-site shall provide parking as required in Exhibit 9.0-9.13,
Lot and Building Type Standards.
               7)   Multi - family uses shall provide parking as required in
the corresponding Exhibit 9.5, Townhome A; Exhibit 9.6, Townhome B; and 
Exhibit 9.7, Two Family Duplex Lot and Building Type Standards.
            viii.   Service access. Access for service vehicles should provide
a direct route to service and loading dock areas, while avoiding movement
through parking areas.
               1)   Paving. Reduction of impervious surfaces through the use of
interlocking pavers is strongly encouraged for areas such as remote parking
lots and parking areas for periodic uses.   
            ix.   Outdoor lighting.
               1)   Street lighting design shall meet the minimum standards
developed by the Illumination Engineering Society and as further regulated in
Section
9.27.
               2)   Exterior lighting shall be directed downward in order to
reduce glare onto adjacent properties.
         g.   Landscaping and Screening Standards.
   Overall composition and location of landscaping shall complement the scale
of the development and its surroundings. In general, larger, well-placed
contiguous planting areas shall be preferred to smaller, disconnected areas.
            i.   General Screening. Required screening shall be in accordance
with the base zoning district requirements.
            ii.   Street trees. A minimum of one deciduous canopy tree per 40
feet of street frontage, or fraction thereof, shall be required. Trees can be
clustered and do not need to be evenly spaced. Trees should preferably be
located between the sidewalk and the curb, within the landscaped area of a
boulevard, or in tree wells installed in pavement or concrete. If placement of
street trees within the right-of-way will interfere with utility lines, trees
may be planted within the front yard setback adjacent to the sidewalk.
            iii.    Parking Area Landscaping and Screening.
               1)   All parking and loading areas fronting public streets or
sidewalks, and all parking and loading areas abutting residential districts or
uses, shall provide:
                  a.   A landscaped area at least 10 feet wide along the public
street or sidewalk;
                  b.   Screening at least three feet in height and not less
than 50 percent opaque; and
                  c.   One tree for each 25 linear feet of parking lot
frontage.
               2)   Parking area interior landscaping. The corners of parking
lots, "islands," and all other areas not used for parking or vehicular
circulation shall be landscaped per Section
9.25. Vegetation can include turf grass, native grasses or other perennial
flowering plants, vines, shrubs or trees. Such spaces may include architectural
features such as benches, kiosks or bicycle parking.
               3)   In large parking lots containing more than 200 spaces, an
additional landscaped area of at least 300 square feet shall be provided for
each 25 spaces or fraction thereof, containing one canopy tree. The remainder
shall be covered with turf grass, native grasses or other perennial flowering
plants, vines or shrubs.
         h.   Stormwater Management. The design and development of the
development should minimize off-site stormwater runoff, promote on-site
filtration, and minimize the discharge of pollutants to ground and surface
water and comply with the requirements of Section
9.35.
   C.   Residential Conservation
      1.   Purpose
The Residential Conservation District is intended to provide a mechanism
allowing the revitalization or conservation of older areas or districts
possessing distinctive features, identity, or character worthy of retention and
enhancement.
      2.   Applicability
         a.   The Residential Conservation District is primarily designed to
accommodate improvements in the R-1d, Single-Family Residential District
directly adjacent to the APD, Architectural Preservation District.  This older
residential neighborhood includes lots that do not entirely conform to existing
district standards but contain some of the community's most unique housing and
street patterns.
         b.   The Residential Conservation District is established through
rezoning and only in conjunction with base zoning districts. Letters, numbers,
or a combination thereof, shall be combined with other applicable district
designations to the property(ies) on which an overlay district is established.
Except as modified by the overlay zoning district, the provisions of the
applicable base-zoning district shall apply to all development within the
boundary of the designated area. If regulations conflict, the applicable
overlay zoning district regulations shall prevail.
         c.   Whenever an overlay district is established, any subsequent
application to change the base-zoning district shall not be construed to be an
application to eliminate the overlay district for the property covered by the
application. An intent to eliminate the overlay district on a given property
shall be expressly stated to be part of the application. 
      3.   Rezoning and Development Review/Approval of Plans
Applications shall be processed in accordance with the same review and hearing
procedures as described in Section
5.09.  Residential Conservation District applications may be submitted only if
the project is located within the Residential Conservation District. However,
this mechanism is optional and shall not be required of all projects located
within the Residential Conservation District. Projects not being developed in
accordance with the Residential Conservation District standards shall be
developed in accordance with the development standards of the underlying base
zoning district. (Ord. 17-14)
      4.   Standards
No building or grading permit for a project within a Residential Conservation
District shall be issued by the Building Official unless the use, alteration or
construction meets the following standards.
         a.   Site Design
   The intent of these design standards is to encourage residential buildings
that address the street in a manner which creates a consistent "facade line"
and defines the public and semi-public realms. In addition, where fences or
dense landscaping exist, or are proposed, it is intended that they be used to
define the boundaries of private property without eliminating the visibility of
the house and front yard from the street.
            i.   Building orientation. The front facades of all principal
structures shall be parallel to the street. On comer lots, both street facing
facades must be parallel to the intersecting streets. On curvilinear streets,
the front facade of all structures shall be parallel to the tangent of the
midpoint of the arc of the street. One element, such as a bay window or dormer,
placed at a front comer of the building may be on a diagonal from the street if
desired.   
            ii.   Build-to lines. On parcels or lots of less than 15,000 square
feet, at least 60 percent of the front façade shall be within 5 feet of the
minimum front yard setback line. On comer sites, at least 60 percent of both
street facades of the building shall be within 5 feet of the minimum setback
lines. Porches may be used meet the 60 percent standard.
            iii.   Fences. Fences, hedgerows, and planter boxes shall not be
more than 42 inches high, measured from natural grade, in all areas forward of
the front facade of the house.
         b.   Building Form
   The intent of the following building form standards is to respect the scale
of the City's older homes by creating new homes which are more similar in their
massing.
         c.   Secondary Mass
   All new structures shall locate at least 10 percent of their total square
footage above grade in a mass which is completely detached from the principal
building, or linked to it by a subordinate connecting element. Accessory
buildings such as garages, sheds, and Accessory Dwelling Units are examples of
appropriate uses for the secondary mass.
         d.   Parking, Garages, and Carports
   The intent of the following parking, garages, and carport standards is to
minimize the potential for pedestrian and vehicular conflicts to minimize the
presence of garages at the street front.
            i.   On the street facing facade(s), the width of the living area
on the first floor shall be at least five feet greater than the width of the
garage or carport.
            ii.   The front facade of the garage or the frontmost supporting
column of a carport shall be set back at least 10 feet further from the street
than the frontmost wall of the house.
            iii.   On lots of at least 12,000 square feet in size, the garage
or carport maybe forward of the front facade of the house only if the garage
doors or carport entry are perpendicular to the street (side-loaded).
            iv.   When the floor of a garage or carport is above or below the
street level, the driveway cut within the front yard setback shall not exceed 2
feet in depth, measured from natural grade.
            v.   The vehicular ramp width of a garage or carport shall not be
greater than 24 feet.
            vi.   The garage doors shall be single stall doors.
         e.   Building Elements
   The intent of the following building elements standards is to ensure that
each residential building has street-facing architectural details and elements
which provide human scale to the facade, enhance the walking experience, and
reinforce local building traditions.
            i.   Street oriented entrance and principal window. All single-
family homes, town, houses, and duplexes shall have a street-oriented entrance
and a street facing principal window. In the case of townhouses and accessory
units facing courtyards or gardens, entries and principal windows should face
those features.   
               1)   On comer lots, entry and principal windows should face
whichever street has a greater block length. Multiple unit residential
buildings shall have at least one street oriented entrance for every 4 units,
and front units must have a street-facing principal window. This standard shall
be satisfied if all of the following conditions are met:    
                  a.   The entry door shall be no more than 10 feet back from
the frontmost wall of the building. Entry doors shall not be taller than eight
feet.
                  b.   A covered entry porch of 50 or more square feet, with a
minimum depth of six feet six, shall be part of the front facade. Entry porches
and canopies shall not be more than one story in height.   
            ii.   A street-facing principal window requires that a significant
window or group of windows face street.
               1)   One story element. All residential buildings shall have a
one-story street facing element the width of which comprises at least 20
percent of the building's overall width. For example, a one story element may
be a porch roof, architectural projection, or living space.   
               2)   Windows. Street facing windows shall not span through the
area where a second floor level would typically exist, which is between nine
and 12 feet above the finished first floor. For interior staircases, this
measurement will be made from the first landing if one exists.    
               3)   Lightwells. All areaways, lightwells and/or stairwells on
the street facing facade(s) of a building shall be entirely recessed behind the
front most wall of the building.   
         f.   Context
      The intent of the following standards is to reinforce the unique
character of the neighborhood by drawing upon the City's vernacular
architecture and neighborhood characteristics in designing new structures.
      The quality of the exterior materials and details and their application
shall be consistent on all sides of the building.
            i.   Materials shall be used in ways that are true to their
characteristics. For instance stucco, which is a light or non-bearing material,
shall not be used below a heavy material, such as stone.   
            ii.   Highly reflective surfaces shall not be used as exterior
materials.
         g.   Inflection
      The following standard must be met for parcels which are 6,000 square
feet or over:
            i.   If a one story building exists directly adjacent to the
subject site, then the new construction must step down to one story in height
along their common lot line. If there are one story buildings on both sides of
the subject site, the applicant may choose the side towards which to inflect. A
one story building shall be defined as follows: A one story building shall mean
a structure, or portion of a structure, where there is only one floor of fully
usable living space, at least 12 feet wide across the street frontage. This
standard shall be met by providing a one story element which is also at least
12 feet wide across the street frontage.
   D.   Residential Lifestyle Community
      1.   Purpose
A Lifestyle Community is a large scale residential development catering to and
associated with a specific lifestyle, the central focus of the community.  Such
community shall be designed in a manner to maintain the overall single family
residential character of the City.  The central focus of a Lifestyle Community
relates to the active or passive recreational lifestyle of the residents within
the community.  This focus is to be the dominant element within a Lifestyle
Community.  All elements and amenities of this community are designed to
emphasize this focus.  A Lifestyle Community may also provide varying detached
and attached housing opportunities
      2.   Applicability

9.15   Lot and Block Arrangement (Ord. 17-13)
   A.   Purpose
   The purpose of this Section is to regulate the arrangement of lots and
building heights within a subdivision and to ensure that lot and height
dimensions are consistent with the appropriate zoning district standards.
   B.   Lots
   All lots shall front onto a public or private road, and all lots shall
conform to or exceed the requirements of the UDO and the zoning district
regulations for the district in which they are located. The following
regulations shall govern the design and layout of lots and lot improvements:
      1.   Block Size: The average perimeter of all blocks within a subdivision
shall not exceed 1,400 feet. No block face shall have a length greater than 400
feet without a common access easement, alley or pedestrian pathway through
access to another street, alley or common access easement. However, existing
streets in adjacent plats, topographical conditions and the type of development
may permit considerable variation in this requirement.
      2.   Block Width: Blocks shall be of sufficient width to provide for two
tiers of lots.
      3.    Block Length: Block lengths along major thoroughfares shall be of
sufficient length to provide safe ingress and egress to the thoroughfare. Block
length shall be a minimum of 500 feet and a max of 1,000 feet.
      4.   Commercial and Industrial Blocks: Blocks in commercial and
industrial districts shall be of sufficient length and depth to best serve the
use intended for the area. Length and depth shall be adequate to include off-
street parking and delivery.
      5.   Lot Arrangement: The lot arrangement shall be such that there will
be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions,
in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with all
applicable UDO health and building regulations and in providing approved
driveway access to buildings on the lots from an approved road.
      6.   Lot Dimensions: All lots shall comply with the standards of Table
9.0 for residential uses and for commercial uses.
      7.   Future Subdivision Lots: Where lots are more than double the minimum
required area, Planning Commission may require that those lots be arranged so
as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where they
would be necessary to serve potential lots, all in compliance with the UDO.
      8.   Side Lot Lines: In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles
to street lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from
this rule is approved by Planning Commission when such variance will give a
better street or lot plan.
      9.   Corner Lots: Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to
allow for the construction of buildings, observing the minimum front yard
setback from both streets.
      10.   Building Setback: The building setback line shall be established
from the edge of the right-of-way or the edge of an access easement. It shall
be equal to the building setbacks listed in Table 9.0 as applicable.
      11.   Commercial and Mixed Uses: Depth and width of lots reserved or laid
out for commercial and/or mixed use purposes shall be adequate to provide for
the off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and
development contemplated.
      12.   Depth-to-Width Ratio: No lot shall have an average depth, which is
more than 4.5 times its average width. However, Planning Commission or  as
appropriate may permit a waiver of this recommended standard, permitting the
lot depth to be up to 3.5 times the average width.
      13.   Double Frontage Lots: In general, double frontage lots and reversed
frontage lots should be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography or orientation, as determined by Planning
Commission or City Planner as appropriate.
      14.   As to lots included in any plat approved by the Planning Commission
and accepted by Council after April 1, 1960, the required depth of the front
yard shall be the distance between the street right-of-way line and the setback
line shown on the plat, if less than 40 feet.
      15.   As to any lots in any recorded plat which has greater restrictions
than are required under this Ordinance, then these recorded restrictions shall
apply and the Planning Commission shall have no authority to grant variances
there from.
   C.   Subdivision of Land within Planned Development Districts
      1.   A lot that is zoned R-PD, Residential Planned Development; O-PD,
Office Planned Development; B-PD, Business Planned Development; and I-PD,
Industrial Planned Development may be subdivided into lots smaller than the
minimum lot area requirement contained in this UDO providing that the following
conditions are met:
         a.   A development plan must have been approved according to the
procedure in Article 5.11 for the entire lot.
         b.   Subdivision and/or development of that lot must be in accordance
with Section
5.11 of this UDO.
         c.   Refer to Section
9.13 of this UDO for additional requirements.
9.17   Guarantee of Construction and Installation of Improvements; Inspections
   A.   Guarantees
      1.   Required agreements
      To provide the City with assurance that the construction of all required
public improvements will be constructed, the subdivider shall enter into one of
the following agreements:
         a.   To construct all improvements directly affecting the subdivision,
as required by the Planning Commission, prior to the final approval of the
development; or
         b.   In lieu of the completion of the improvements, to furnish a bond
executed by a surety company, a cash deposit by certified check in a non-
interest bearing account or an irrevocable letter of credit, in a form approved
by the Municipal Attorney, from a bank or lending institution licensed to do
business in the State, equal to the cost of construction of such improvements
as shown on plans, such cost being based on an estimate provided by the
developer and approved by the City Engineer.
      2.   Execution of subdivider's agreement and performance bond, certified
check or letter of credit prior to final plat approval. Before the final plan
is given final approval, the developer shall have executed a subdivider's
contract and a performance bond, certified check or irrevocable letter of
credit with the Council covering the estimated cost of required improvements.
The performance bond, cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit shall run to
the City until all improvements are complete, for a period of not more than two
years  from the date of execution and shall provide that the subdivider, his or
her heirs, successors and assigns and their agents or servants, will comply
with all applicable terms, conditions, provisions and requirements of these
Subdivision Regulations and will faithfully perform and complete the work of
constructing and installing such facilities or improvements in accordance with
such laws and regulations.
      3.   Extensions of time. If the construction or installation of any
improvement or facility, for which guarantee has been made by the developer in
the form of bond, cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit, is not
completed within the time stipulated, but not more than two years from the date
of final approval of the record plat, the developer may request the Council to
grant an extension of up to six months, provided that he or she can show
reasonable cause for inability to complete said improvements within the time
stipulated in the subdivider's agreement. The Council may grant additional
extensions, upon application by the developer and a showing of good cause,
provided that each said extension does not exceed six months. At the expiration
of all extensions, the City will use as much of the bond, cash deposit or
irrevocable letter of credit as is necessary to complete the construction of
the improvements. The same shall apply whenever construction of improvements is
performed in accordance with applicable standards and specifications.
      4.   Completion of work; reduction of bond, cash deposit or irrevocable
letter of credit. As required improvements are completed, approved and
accepted, the Council may, with the concurrence of the City Engineer, reduce
the amount of the performance bond, cash deposit or irrevocable letter of
credit.
      5.   Maintenance Bond that guarantees work for one year shall be posted
at the completion of work and prior to release of any other performance bond or
guarantee.  The required maintenance bond shall be 10% of the value of all
performance bonds.
   B.   Inspections
   It shall be the responsibility of a subdivider to notify the City Engineer's
office at least twenty-four hours in advance of the time that all is in
readiness for the following periodic inspections which must be made:
      1.   After all storm sewers, drains and appurtenances are installed and
before trenches for the same are backfilled.
      2.   After the forms for curbs and gutters are set (where combined curbs
and gutters are required), the gravel base is in place and before any concrete
is placed.
      3.   After the forms for drive approaches or sidewalks are set and the
gravel base is in place and before any concrete is placed.
      4.   After the subgrade is shaped and rolled and before a compaction test
is made.
      5.   After forms are in place and immediately before any pavement or
channel concrete is placed.
      6.   Immediately before any soil stabilization additives, lime, fly ash
or aggregates are placed in base courses.
      7.   Immediately before any prime is applied.
      8.   Immediately before any asphaltic concrete is laid.
      9.   After the surveyor certifies that section monuments are in place.
      10.   No work shall be accepted or bonds released unless these
inspections have been made and the work is found to be satisfactory.
Part 3:  Site Design and Improvement Standards
9.19   Purpose
Part 3 expands upon the zoning district and subdivision development standards
of Parts 1 and 2 by addressing additional details of site planning, project
design, and the operation of land uses. The intent of these standards is to

development on neighboring properties, and produces an environment of stable
and desirable character, consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
9.21   Applicability
The requirements of Part 3 shall apply to all proposed development and new land
uses, except as specified in Article 3 (Nonconforming Uses, Lots, Structures,
and Combination), and shall be considered in combination with the standards for
the applicable zoning district in Part 1 (Zoning).
9.23   Required Improvements
   A.   Streets (See Section
9.13, B).
   B.   Sidewalks (See Section
9.13, D).

9.25   Landscaping, Screening and Buffering Standards
   Whenever any property is affected by these landscape requirements, the
property owner or developer shall prepare a landscape plan for submittal to the
Planning Director or designee for review.
   A.   Implementation of Landscaping Plan
      Where landscaping is required, no building permit shall be issued until
the required landscaping plan has been submitted and approved by the City
Planner.  It shall not be legal to use the property (as opposed to the
structure) until landscaping is completed as shown on the approved plan. In
instances where conditions do not permit immediate planting of materials and if
the City Planner is furnished with a bond or irrevocable letter of credit, then
a Temporary Occupancy Permit may be issued.
   B.   Posting of Bond or Irrevocable Letter of Credit
      A performance bond or irrevocable letter of credit from a banking
institution or other such surety acceptable to the Municipal Attorney may be
substituted for completion of the landscaping as shown on the approved
landscaping plan, subject to the approval of the City Planner.  After a bond or
irrevocable letter of credit has been posted, the landscaping material required
in the approved landscaping plan shall be installed within six months after the
date of posting the bond or irrevocable letter of credit. A one-month extension
of the planting period may be granted by the City Planner upon a demonstration
by the property owner or developer that such an extension is warranted because
of adverse weather conditions or unavailability of required plant materials. 
No more than three such one-month extensions may be granted.  Foreclosure
proceedings shall be brought against the performance bond or irrevocable letter
of credit if the required landscaping plans have not been complied with by the
end of the approved planting period.
   C.   Landscape, Screening and Bufferyard Requirements (Ord. 17-14, 7-18)
      1.   Fence or Wall:  Any fence or wall that is required for screening
purposes or within a bufferyard shall be constructed using natural materials
such as wood, brick or stone. Such a fence or wall shall appear solid with no
visible gaps. A fence or wall shall have a minimum height of 6 feet and a
maximum height of 7 feet.
      2.   Table of Minimum Plant Size: Unless otherwise specifically indicated
elsewhere in this ordinance, all plant materials used for screening or within 
a bufferyard shall meet the following minimum size standards:
               Plant Material Type      Minimum Size
               Canopy Tree
                  Single Stem         2.5 inch caliper
                  Multi-Stem         10 feet height
               Understory Tree         1.5 inch caliper
               Evergreen Tree         5 feet height
               Shrub
                  Deciduous         24 inches height
                  Evergreen         18 inches height
      3.   Planting Requirements: All trees, shrubs and other plantings shall
be installed in accordance to standards established by the most recent American
Standard for Nursery Stock . (Ord. 17-16)
      4.   Location of Required Screening: All planting, berming, fencing and/
or walls required by this ordinance shall be installed within the area
established as the bufferyard. However, at the discretion of the approving
authority, all or a portion of the required screening may be placed outside of
the required bufferyard where, because of topographical or other physical
constraint, such location provides the most effective screening.  All
landscaping installed shall be aesthetically located to maximize buffering to
any adjoining residentially zoned land. (Ord. 16-13)
      5.   Bufferyard Requirements: Existing vegetation that meet or exceed the
requirements in the Table of Minimum Plant Size or any tree required to be
preserved by this or other Ordinance that is located within a required
bufferyard shall be counted to satisfy the planting requirements contained in
this Ordinance. All improvements made to these areas shall be in accordance to
Table 9.6 Bufferyard, Landscaping and Screening Requirements.
      6.   Earthen Berm: An earthen berm, when required, shall be constructed
in a sculpted and undulating manner to an average height as stated in Table
9.25 Bufferyard, Landscaping and Screening Requirements. Berming shall be
required where a bufferyard is devoid of trees or any significant vegetation or
where topographic constraints or stormwater drainage systems do not preclude
its construction.
      7.   Traffic Hazard: Where located adjacent to a dedicated public right-
of-way, landscaping or screening shall not be permitted to obstruct clear
vision so as to create a potential traffic hazard.
      8.   Vehicle Inventory Lot: The minimum landscape design requirements as
defined herein for a Vehicle Inventory Lot may be reduced or modified upon
concurrence from the requisite approval authority.

create or extend a safety hazard.
9.27   Non-Residential On-Site Lighting Standards
   A.   Purpose
   The intent of the sight lighting standards is to provide a level of
illumination necessary for adequate, safe, and efficient movement of vehicles
and persons without affecting neighboring properties. Further, the level of
illumination may vary according to the type of use on a lot. Prior to the
approval of a Building Permit, Occupancy Permit, Property Maintenance, or
Certificate of Zoning Compliance, a plan demonstrating compliance with the
following exterior lighting standards will be submitted and approved by the
City Planner for non-residential uses.
      1.   Lighting parking, loading and service areas must all be consistent
in color, size, height and design.
      2.   When field measurements of light readings are made, they are to be
taken with a light meter at grade.
      3.   All commercial developments with 10 or more parking spaces are
required to lighting for the entire area used for vehicles, exterior doorways,
and access doorways.
      4.   Apartments, townhomes, attached single-family, patio homes or
residential development accessed by private streets with evenly distributed
parking with clusters of five exterior spaces or less shall:
         a.   Illuminate all private streets or main traffic circulation aisles
in compliance with this Section.
         b.   Illuminate secondary areas for vehicle use, such as driveways or
and motor courts by post mounted or wall mounted fixtures in keeping with the
residential character of the area.
         c.   All multi-family residential developments with clusters of six
exterior parking spaces or more are to be illuminated in compliance with the
required standard listed above for commercial developments.
   B.   Applicability
   All non-residential developments are required to provide exterior lighting
for all exterior doorways, pedestrian pathways, and parking and loading/service
areas.
   C.   Minimum Site Lighting Criteria
   All exterior lighting shall meet the following minimum standards and be
demonstrated on all plan submittals:
      1.   0.5 Foot-candles Average Maintained: Measured at grade in all
parking and loading areas and pedestrian pathways. Actual site measurement
compliance shall not drop below a minimum of 0.3 foot-candles at any one
location. For design purposes, the light loss factor (LLF) as defined in
Article 11 shall be calculated at: (Ord. 17-16)
         a.   0.7 LLF for Incandescent, Metal Halide, and Mercury Vapor lamp
sources.
         b.   0.8 LLF for Fluorescent and Sodium lamp sources.
         c.   0.9 LLF for Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamp sources.

                  Mixed Use            30 feet maximum
      4.   The color temperature of exterior illumination shall appear as
natural or neutral ranging from a minimum of 2,200K (high pressure sodium) to a
maximum of 5,400K (metal halide) as measured in Degrees Kelvin.
   D.   Light Trespass Criteria
   Light originating on a site shall not be permitted beyond the site to exceed
the following values when measured at grade 10 feet beyond the property line
for the following adjacent properties:
                  Single-Family         0.3 foot-candles
                  Multi-Family            0.5 foot-candles
                  Office, Commercial & Inst.      1.0 foot-candles
                  Mixed Use            1.0 foot-candles
                  Industrial Warehouse      1.5 foot-candles
                  Highway Commercial      1.5 foot-candles
   Outdoor Sports Facilities will be reviewed for compliance with regard to the
intent of these exterior lighting standards to minimize the impact of light
trespass and glare on all surrounding properties and public rights-of-way.
   Service station and service station/mini-mart canopy lighting and outdoor
display area lighting used in conjunction with a vehicle sale, rental and
ancillary service establishment must not exceed an average lighting level of 25
foot-candles as measured horizontally at grade.

angle of 90° above nadir is zero, and the luminous intensity (in candelas) at
or above a vertical angle of 80° above nadir does not numerically exceed 10% of
the luminous flux (in lumens) of the lamp or lamps in the luminaire.
         b.   Cutoff—The luminous intensity (in candelas) at or above an angle
of 90° above nadir does not numerically exceed 2.5% of the luminous flux (in
lumens) of the lamp or lamps in the luminaire, and the luminous intensity (in
candelas) at or above a vertical angle of 80° above nadir does not numerically
exceed 10% of the luminous flux (in lumens) of the lamp or lamps in the
luminaire.
         c.   Semi-cutoff—The luminous intensity (in candelas) at or above an
angle of 90° above nadir does not numerically exceed 5% of the luminous flux
(in lumens) of the lamp or lamps in the luminaire, and the luminous intensity
(in candelas) at or above a vertical angle of 80° above nadir does not
numerically exceed 20% of the luminous flux (in lumens) of the lamp or lamps in
the luminaire.
         d.   Non-cutoff—There is no candela limitation in the zone above
maximum candela.
      2.   All other exterior lighting, including but not limited to doorways,
architectural, accent, landscape, signage, decorative, security, floodlighting,
or area lighting shall be "total cutoff type" or no portion of the lamp,
reflector, lens, or refracting system may extend beyond the housing or shield
so as to create or allow glare to be visible from off site, except the
following:
         a.   Lighting required by the Building Code for emergency egress when
operating in emergency conditions; or
         b.   Light sources which do not exceed 2300 initial lumens or 4000
main beam candlepower.

         a.   All required off-street parking facilities shall be situated on
the same lot as the use it is intended to serve. However, if the City Planner
or his appointed designee, determines that it is not feasible for a building or
use to fulfill their total parking requirement on the premises, parking may be
located off-premises provided that:
            i.   The farthest public or customer parking space is not more than
400 feet away from the premises.
            ii.   The farthest employee parking space is not more than 1,000
feet away from the premises.
            iii.   Such parking area meets all other requirements of this
ordinance.
         b.   In no event shall the required parking for a residential use be
located elsewhere than on the premises for which such parking is required.
      6.   Parking Provided Under Separate Ownership
      If a use requiring parking spaces is in one ownership and all or part of
the required parking spaces provided is in another ownership, the property
owners involved shall submit a legal agreement, approved by the City Attorney,
guaranteeing that the required parking spaces shall be maintained so long as
the use requiring parking is in existence or unless the required parking is
provided elsewhere in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. Such
instrument shall be recorded by the property owner in the office of the
corresponding County Recorder and a copy filed with the Planning Department.
   E.   Computation
      1.   Number of Spaces
      When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by
this section results in a fraction less than one-half, may be disregarded and a
fraction equal or greater than one-half, shall be counted as one parking space.
      2.   Units of Measurement
      For the purpose of determining off-street parking requirements, the
following units of measurement shall apply:
         a.   Floor Area.  Floor area for non-residential purposes shall be the
sum of the gross horizontal area of all floors of a building measured from the
exterior faces of the exterior walls. Any floor or part thereof used for
incidental storage of goods, materials, or merchandise, not to exceed 25% of
the total floor area, may be excluded from the gross floor area computation.
(Ord. 17-14)
         b.   Hospital Beds.  In hospitals, bassinets shall not be counted as
beds.
         c.   Places of Public Assembly
            i.   Benches - In stadiums, sports arenas, churches and other
places of assembly in which those in attendance occupy benches, pews or other
similar seating facilities, 20 inches of such seating facilities shall be
counted as one seat.
            ii.   Fixed Seats and Assembly Areas - In cases where a place of
assembly has both fixed seats and open assembly area, requirements shall be
computed separately for each type and added together.
         d.   Employees on the Largest Work Shift.  Employees on the largest
work shift means the maximum number of employees which could be employed at a
facility, regardless of the time period during which this occurs and regardless
of whether any such person is a full-time employee. The largest work shift may
be a particular day of the week or a lunch or dinner period in the case of a
restaurant.
         e.   Capacity.  Capacity means the maximum number of persons which may
be accommodated by the use as determined by its design or by fire code
regulations, whichever is greater.
   F.   Number of Parking Spaces Required
      The minimum number of parking spaces required per use is shown in Table
9.8. (Ord. 17-14, 7-18)
   G.   Bicycle Parking Requirements  (Ord. 17-16)
      b.   Off-street parking of bicycles shall be provided as follows:
      a.   Multi-Family Residential uses: 1 space per 10 units.
      b.   Non-residential uses: Two (2) spaces minimum, plus one space per 15
required off-street parking spaces up to a maximum of 20 total bicycle parking
spaces.
      c.   For each required bicycle parking space, a permanently anchored
facility shall be provided which supports the bicycle frame and can enable a
user to secure the frame and one wheel of a bicycle with a six (6) foot cable
and lock. The facility shall be conveniently located to a public entrance of
the use it serves. Acceptable bicycle parking facilities include the following:
         i.   Permanently anchored freestanding bicycle rack, such as an
Inverted-U  rack, an Inverted-U Series Rack, Post and Ring rack, or other
acceptable bicycle parking rack as determined by the City Planner provided it
meets the requirements noted above.
         ii.   Enclosed bicycle lockers large enough to accommodate a bicycle
with a three (3)-foot handlebar width, a height of four (4) feet from the
bottom of the wheel to the top of the handlebar, and a length of six (6) feet
from the front of the front wheel to the back of the rear wheel. 
         iii.   A fenced, covered, locked, or guarded bicycle storage area. 
Such area shall be large enough that each of the required bicycle parking
spaces can accommodate a bicycle with a three (3)-foot handlebar width, a
height of four (4) feet from the bottom of the wheel to the top of the
handlebar and a length of six (6) feet from the front of the bike to the back
of the rear wheel.

9.31   Access Control for Streets and Highways
   A.   Purpose
   The intent of this section is to:
      1.   Regulate driveway access to public streets to lessen the impact of
future development on the City's thoroughfare system. These standards are
designed to minimize safety hazards, traffic congestion, and other adverse
impacts thereby protecting the integrity of the thoroughfare system.
      2.   Minimize the number of driveways and access points onto public
streets. These regulations should be interpreted to that end whenever possible.
      3.   Require that sidewalks be constructed along arterial and collector
streets to provide for safe and convenient pedestrian access to neighborhoods,
businesses and other community facilities.
   B.   Access to City by Driveway or Street Located Outside City
   These requirements shall specifically apply to a situation where the
driveway or street or a portion of the driveway or street to be constructed,
altered or the access point for such a driveway or street is within the City of
Centerville and the land or a portion of the land to be accessed by the
driveway or street is outside the City of Centerville. A Development Approval
request in accordance with Section
5.09 of this UDO shall be required by the developer before any such
construction within or access to the City of Centerville shall be permitted.
   C.   Roadway Access Standards
   (See Ohio Department of Transportation Ohio State's Highway Access
Management Manual, December 2001 and the Institute of Transportation Engineers
Transportation and Land Development, 2nd Edition; or most recent revisions.)
(Ord. 17-14)
      1.   Street Cut Permit Required
         A street-cut permit shall be required to permit or expand a driveway
to intersect any public street.
      2.   Driveway and Roadway Surface
         All driveways and roadways shall be constructed with a hard paved
surface. (Ord. 17-13)
      3.   Driveway and Roadway Spacing
         The minimum spacing of driveways and roadways in relation to other
driveways and roadways shall be based on the posted speed limit as illustrated
in Table 9.10. This distance shall be measured from the point formed by the
intersection of extended curb lines of each driveway or street.
Table 9.10   Minimum Driveway Spacing

         a.   The minimum spacing distance between adjacent one-way driveways
or roadways with the inbound drive upstream from the outbound drive may be
reduced by 1/2 the distance shown in Table 9.10.
         b.   The minimum driveway spacing distance for single-family or two-
family residential uses shall be a minimum of 20 feet; driveways may, however,
be joined together.
      4.   Alignment Across the Street
         a.   Driveways or roadways shall either be directly opposite other
driveway or street intersections or shall be offset by the minimum driveway
spacing shown in Table 9.10 except in locations where there is a raised median
in the street.
         b.   Single-family and two-family residential uses shall be exempt
from this provision.
      5.   Dimensions of a Driveway
         a.   Non-Residential Uses (including Multi-Family Residential Uses)
            i.   All driveways shall have a minimum width of 24 feet. This
provision may be modified by the City Planner or his designee to allow for a
second entrance lane and/or a left turn exit lane for a large or intensive non-
residential or multi-family residential use. In no case shall any driveway
exceed 48 feet in width.
            ii.   Aisle widths for off-street parking areas shall be as
provided in Table 9.7, Minimum Design Standards for Off-Street Parking Areas.
         b.   Single-Family and Two-Family Residential Uses
            i.   A driveway for a single-family or two-family residence shall
have a minimum width of 8 feet and a minimum length of 20 feet from the public
right-of-way.  In no case shall any driveway exceed 24 feet in width at the
public right of way. (Ord. 17-14)
            ii.   A driveway shall extend from the public right-of-way or curb-
line of a private street to any vehicle parking area or the garage door of any
principal or accessory building whichever is greater.
      6.   Intersection Angle
      A driveway or roadway shall intersect a cross-street at, or nearly at, a
right, 90 degree angle. In no case shall any intersection have an angle less
than 75 degrees.
      7.   Grade at Intersection
         a.   A driveway or roadway intersection shall have a maximum vertical
grade of 2 percent, for a distance of 70 feet, for each leg of the
intersection. This distance shall be measured from the edge of pavement of the
cross-street back a distance 70 feet as shown in Figure 9.3.
             Figure 9.3    Grade at Intersection

         b.    Single-family and two-family residential uses shall have a
maximum vertical grade of 2 percent for a distance of 10 feet or to the public
right-of-way whichever is greater.
      8.   Horizontal Intersection Sight Distance
         a.   In order to provide a clear view of intersecting streets to the
motorist, there shall be a triangular area of clear vision formed by the 2
intersecting streets and the driver's line of sight toward a car approaching
the intersection. Reference A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and
Streets (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials).
(Ord. 17-14)
         b.   On any portion of a lot that lies within this triangular area,
nothing shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow which impedes
vision between a height of 2.5 feet and 10 feet above the grade at any point
within the triangle.
      9.   Vertical Intersection Sight Distance (Ord. 17-14)
         a.   Driveways or roadways shall intersect other roadways at a point
where there shall be provided a line of clear vision that is free of hills or
valleys that can obstruct the visibility of a motorist. Reference A Policy on
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (American Association of State Highway
and Transportation Officials).

      10.   Median Openings
      Openings to non-mountable medians with a width of 4 feet or greater shall
be permitted only as follows:
         a.   Residential Properties
         A median opening will be permitted for 1 driveway to each residential
property when the alternate route that would be required to gain access to the
driveway is in excess of 2600 feet.
         b.   Non-Residential Properties
            i.   A median opening may be permitted for 1 driveway to each on-
corner property.
            ii.   A median opening will not be permitted for driveways to
corner properties where access can be gained by way of the cross-street, except
as noted below (See Figure 9.7).

IMAGES/0-0-0-278.png]
 
            iii.   A median opening may be permitted to a corner property only
if the alternate turn from the cross-street causes unnecessary delay or creates
a traffic hazard.
         c.   Additional median openings may be permitted to serve high volume
parking lot driveways as the need is demonstrated.
         d.   Crosswalks
            To provide a minimum length of median at crosswalks, openings will
not be permitted within 20 feet of a crosswalk.
      11.   These access control standards may be modified and increased or
decreased upon recommendation to the City Planner or his designee, in order to
accommodate unique safety or design situations or if indicated by a traffic
impact analysis. In cases where these standards are recommended to be modified,
the City Planner or his designee shall make a report which documents the facts
of the case and the rationale for modifying these requirements.
9.33   Parking Fee-in-Lieu. (Ord. 35-14)
   A.   Purpose: The Parking Fee-in-Lieu program incentivizes a more efficient
use of land for commercial purposes to preserve the ambiance and character of
the surrounding area while affording a revenue mechanism for public parking
needs.
   B.   Applicability: The Parking Fee-in-Lieu program shall be applicable
solely within the area defined as the Architectural Preservation District (APD)
on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Centerville, and under one or more of
the following circumstances:
      1.   New construction of commercial or residential development.
      2.   Commercial or residential additions to existing buildings whether
attached or detached from the main structure.
      3.   When an alteration or rehabilitation within an existing structure
results in an increased parking requirement pursuant to Articles 3.13 and 9.29.
      4.   When the parking requirement for a permitted or conditional use
exceeds the available parking on the premises pursuant to Articles 3.13 and
9.29.
   C.   Determination of the fee-in-lieu of parking
      1.   The City Planner shall calculate the required number of parking
spaces in accordance with Article 9.29. The City Planner shall communicate the
required number of parking spaces to the Applicant. The existence of an active
Variance affecting the quantity of required parking spaces shall not be
considered for the purpose of determining the fee-in-lieu of parking.
      2.   The Applicant may request to pay a fee-in-lieu of providing the
required number of parking spaces in accordance with the following:
         a.   At minimum, 50% of the required number of parking spaces shall be
provided on the premises in accordance with Articles 3.13 and 9.29.
         b.   All or a portion of the required parking not to be provided in
accordance with part (a) above may be substituted for a one-time fee in the
following amounts (2015 dollars):
            i.   Parking spaces one (1) through five (5): $2,000 each.
            ii.   Parking spaces six (6) through ten (10): $3,500 each.
            iii.   Parking spaces eleven (11) and above: $5,000 each.
         c.   The Parking Fee-in-Lieu amount shall be based upon the following
equation:
            Parking Fee-      Aggregate Fee as             Consumer Price Index
as
            in-Lieu      =   Calculated from Part (b)   X    calculated by the
Bureau
                        above               of Labor Statistics
         d.   The fee-in-lieu shall be aggregated and paid in its entirety to
the City of Centerville in a form acceptable to the Director of Finance prior
to the issuance of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance. The fee is non-
refundable.
         e.   The fee-in-lieu shall be applicable at each issuance of a
Certificate of Zoning Compliance for a premises. Credit shall not be granted
for previous fee-in-lieu payments applicable to the premises.
         f.   Payment of a fee-in-lieu of parking does not absolve the
developer or property owner from any future obligation to participate in future
construction of public parking programs or facilities through additional
funding mechanisms (e.g., a local improvement district, tax increment
financing, etc.).
      3.   In making a determination on the request, the City Planner shall
consider:
         a.   The extent to which the parking requirements as applied to the
subject property overly restrict nominal use of the property;
         b.   Whether granting the request would have a deleterious effect on
other property owners in the immediate area; and
         c.   Whether granting the request would lead to a better overall
result than would strict adherence to the parking requirements of Article 9.29
for the purposes of encouraging appropriate land uses, improving pedestrian
circulation, achieving better parking design, and preserving the built
environment.
   D.   Limitations of the Parking Fee-in-Lieu program
      1.   Funds collected through the Parking Fee-in-Lieu program shall be
expended on public parking programs and facilities in the general vicinity of
the area(s) listed in Article 9.33(B) above. Payment of a fee-in-lieu of
parking is not a guarantee to a developer or property owner that public parking
programs and facilities will be conducted or constructed for the sole use of or
in immediate proximity to that development.
      2.   Funds may be expended by the City at any time for one or more of the
following purposes, including any process, procedure, or expenditure required
thereto:
         a.   Construction of a new public parking facility.
         b.   Expansion of an existing public parking facility.
         c.   Conversion of an existing private parking facility to public use
via easement, purchase, or lease.
         d.   Infrastructure attributable to a public parking facility, such as
signage, lighting, landscaping, and stormwater management facilities.
         e.   Pedestrian, bicycle, and transit-related infrastructure.
         f.   Public service annoucements, advertising, publications, and other
non-infrastructure programming pertaining to public parking facilities.
         g.   General maintenance, repair, and replacement of any noted above
item or facility.
9.35   Stormwater and Drainage Standards
   A.   Purpose
   The purpose of these stormwater drainage standards is to provide adequate
facilities to accommodate stormwater runoff created by a development project
either through on-site or off-site improvements or alterations to the drainage
system.
   B.   Site Grading and Drainage Development Plans; Waivers.
      1.   Any person or persons proposing to develop or redevelop land shall
design and implement a site grading and drainage development plan which will:
         a.   Yield quantities of surface water runoff from the development
site at rates which are the same as or less than those before development
occurred and result in rates of gross erosion as specified in this section.
         b.   Not result in increasing current potentials for sedimentation of
lands, siltation of waters and flooding of watercourses that are at lower
elevations off-site.
         c.   Meet or exceed requirements promulgated by state and federal
agencies to promote positive drainage practices, mitigate damage to water
quality and foster beneficial environmental practices. (Ord. 17-14)
      2.   No changes subject to regulation under this chapter shall be made in
the existing natural surface composition or subsurface configuration of any
land proposed for development or redevelopment within the City without prior
written approval of a site development plan by the Approving Agent. Approval of
a site development plan required according to Section
9.35, H shall not be given:
         a.   Unless a determination is made by the Approving Agent that
implementation of an approved site grading and drainage development plan would
not cause runoff, erosion and sediment impacts that would be harmful or
damaging to the lands and waters off-site; or
         b.   Until a plan for minimizing the harmful and damaging potentials
of runoff, erosion and sediment impacts anticipated resulting from the
implementation of a proposed site grading and drainage development plan has
been approved by the Approving Agent.
      3.   Development situations may exist such that the development will have
none of the harmful effects associated with increased runoff rates and volumes
or sediment disposition.  Such developments are eligible for a waiver from
these standards; however, the waiver applies only to the following requirements
and may have specific conditions attached by the Approving Agent, including,
but not limited to:
         a.   The preparation of plans, maps and/or information specified in
Section
9.35, I.
         b.   The installation of sediment abatement control devices until such
time as site inspection indicates that they may be unnecessary.
         c.   Controlling runoff to predevelopment conditions as specified in
Section
9.35, F except that storm water runoff must be controlled to the maximum volume
and minimum rate feasible for the site as determined by the Approving Agent.
      4.   The request for a waiver shall be in writing and shall include
sufficient detail to determine that granting a waiver will not be detrimental
to abutting properties or to the drainage system.  However, the waiver does not
in any way imply a relaxation of any of the other standards in this chapter,
including the requirement for adequate on-site drainage, the ability to accept
runoff from land tributary to the development or reasonable control of soil
erosion and sediment.  Development activities for which waivers may be
considered include the following:
         a.   Single-family residential developments involving improvement of
an individual lot in a previously approved subdivision.
         b.   Multifamily residential, commercial or industrial developments
which total 2 acres or less.
         c.   Modifications to, or redevelopment of, an existing development
which will not result in additional impervious areas.
      5.   Development activities that are exempt from this chapter include the
following:
         a.   Additions of less than 250 square feet to existing property, such
as driveways, sidewalks, patios, etc.

into a strata of porous soil at a level where the bottom of the dry well is
above the ground water table at its seasonal height.
         b.   The minimum distance of dry wells from buildings shall be 20
feet. The separation between dry wells and buildings may be reduced to ten feet
if the diameter of the dry well does not exceed three feet.
         c.   The size and construction of dry wells shall be adequate to
dispose of the water.
         d.   Sump pumps shall be connected to dry wells or to the nearest
point of the drainage system of the plat. Sump pumps and other drains which
have water flowing more than 50 percent of the time may not discharge into the
gutter.
   D.   Grading
      1.   Intent - It is the intent of this section to provide grading which
shall:
         a.   Direct water away from buildings;
         b.   Prevent standing water and soil saturation detrimental to
structures and lot uses;
         c.   Provide for disposal of water from a lot;
         d.   Preserve such desirable lot features that do not interfere with
the proper drainage of the lot or the desired use of the lot;
         e.   Provide grades for safe and convenient access to and around
buildings and lots for their use and maintenance; and
         f.   Protect adjacent properties from excessive water drainage.
      2.   General
         a.   For examples of typical grading design, see illustrations
following the text of these regulations.
         b.   For regulations pertaining to building foundations or concrete
floor slabs on fill, see the 2006 Residential Code of Ohio (RCO), and the OBC
Commercial Building Code.

to lower areas shall conform to Section
9.35, C, 2.
         b.   The horizontal width of the downward sloping area away from
foundations shall be a minimum of 10 feet, except where restricted by property
lines.
         c.   The vertical fall of protective slopes shall be a minimum of 6
inches in 10 feet. However, the vertical fall at the upper end of a swale may
be reduced to 3 inches in 10 feet, provided that a long slope from a nearby
high bank does not exist.
      4.   Minimum Gradient
         a.   For concrete or other impervious surfaces, the minimum gradient
shall be one sixteenth of an inch per foot (one-half of one percent).
         b.   For pervious surfaces, the minimum gradient in the first 10 feet
from the building shall be as provided in Section
9.35, D, 3. Beyond the 10 foot area, the gradient shall comply with the
objectives of this chapter.
      5.   Maximum Gradient
      The maximum gradient shall be 2 1/2 inches for the first four feet from
all building walls, except where restricted by property lines. The balance of
the protective slope shall have a maximum gradient of 2:1 (two feet
horizontally to one foot vertically). (See Section
9.35(D)(9)(b)).
      6.   Usable Outdoor Area (Ord. 17-16)
      At minimum, 35% of a single- or two-family residential lot shall be
composed of usable outdoor area. The usable outdoor area may be located in any
yard(s), but shall be of such location, size and shape as to provide for
outdoor living and service functions. Usable outdoor areas may overlap or be
part of required protective slopes around buildings. The area may be a single
area or several adjacent or separate subareas.  The maximum grade for usable
areas shall be five (5) percent. Usable area may include any driveway, patio,
or other paved surface, but shall not include the footprint of the primary
structure. The City Council may waive this requirement in its entirety or on a
lot-by-lot basis as part of a Preliminary or Final Development Plan,
Preliminary Subdivision or Record Plat.
      7.   Other Lot Areas.
         a.   The minimum gradient for other lot areas shall comply with
subsection 7 hereof, unless lesser gradients are shown on exhibits accepted by
the City prior to any building construction activity, including grading and/or
clearing. To be acceptable, the lesser gradient must be adequate to drain the
area without having a detrimental effect upon buildings or upon essential lot
usage and improvements. Conditions which would result in prolonged standing of
water at any season are not acceptable. Where surface water disposal is
proposed by infiltration into the ground, technical exhibits, such as soil
gradation analyses and/or infiltration tests, may be required.
         b.   The maximum gradient, unless slopes are to be held by
satisfactory existing or planned vegetation, rock outcroppings or brick, rock
or concrete walls, shall be limited as follows:
            i.   If the vertical height of slope is 30 inches or less, the
maximum gradient shall be one and one-half feet horizontal to one foot
vertical.
            ii.   For slopes with a vertical height of over 30 inches, the
maximum gradient shall be two feet horizontally to one foot vertically.
            iii.   Slopes of over 1 1/2 feet to 1 foot with only grass planned
as the retaining vegetation shall not be permitted.
         c.   Tops and bottoms of banks at swales, terraces, etc., shall be
rounded for convenient maintenance.
      8.   Rough Grading
         a.   Preservation of Trees and Shrubs. Natural site assets, such as
existing trees, shrubs, ground cover and top soil, shall be preserved and
protected whenever practicable, provided that retention of such items does not
interfere with the drainage plan of the area.
         b.   Compliance with Drainage Plans and Plot Plans; Subgrades. The
balance of the lot shall be graded to comply with the grading indicated on the
drainage plan and the plot plan submitted for a building permit. The subgrade
shall be established by cut and fill, approximately parallel to the finish
gradients and at an elevation to allow for sod and other installations.
         c.   Filled Areas
            i.   Filled areas under and fifteen feet beyond buildings and other
structures shall be compacted to meet the requirements of the 2006 Residential
Code of Ohio (RCO) One and Two Family Dwelling Code, as adopted in Section of
the Building and Housing Code and the OBC, Ohio Commercial Code.
            ii.   For the balance of the area involved, all surface debris
detrimental to lot improvements shall be removed.
            iii.   Tree stumps eighteen inches below finished grade shall be
removed and cut down.
            iv.   Original ground exceeding a one to three slope shall be
scarified and benched if it is to receive fill, in order to prevent slippage of
the fill.
            v.   Fill material shall be reasonably free of debris or other
material detrimental to the lot for the first three feet below the finished
grade and shall have reasonable moisture content when placed. Fill in the
vicinity of future drainage structures shall be compacted to avoid later
settling and damage to the structures.
            vi.   Fills having a depth of over sixty inches shall be
constructed in accordance with standard engineering practices.
      9.   Finish Grading
         a.   Lot areas shall be finish graded to the extent necessary to make
the entire lot comply with the preceding standards of this chapter.
         b.   The subsoil shall be smoothed parallel to the finished grade
elevations and scarified where necessary to secure bond with the surface soil
or sod.
         c.   Where installation of a lawn or planting is required, the surface
soil shall be workable, suitable for the support of plant life and free of
large stones and other debris detrimental to plant life. For other areas the
soil shall be as provided above or shall be soil which the property owner can
improve to a comparable quality without difficult or expensive work.
         d.   Surface soil shall be soil capable of sustaining plant life.
         e.   Surface soil shall be spread uniformly to provide a smooth even
surface.
         f.   Surface soil shall be compacted lightly to minimize settlement.
   E.   Erosion Control: Lawns and Ground Cover
      1.   Intent. Lawns and ground cover shall be provided:
         a.   To prevent erosion; and
         b.   Where required, to make yards usable.
      2.   Required Areas. Appropriate vegetative cover shall be provided for
the following areas as follows:
         a.   On swales, as follows:
            i.   Where the gradient exceeds five-eighths of an inch per foot,
five percent.
            ii.   Minimum width: 4 feet. (See Section
9.35, Storm water and Drainage Standards)
         b.   On slopes where the gradient exceeds 4 feet horizontally to one
foot vertically.
         c.   On other areas from the street roadway to a point 15 feet behind
the building, or as agreed between the builder and purchaser. Planting in
undisturbed areas may be omitted when suitable existing vegetation is present
to prevent erosion.
      3.   Materials
         a.   Lawn materials and ground cover shall be appropriate for the
expected use and suitable to the local climate, soil conditions and exposure.
         b.   Seed quality shall have a minimum purity of 85 percent, a minimum
germination of 80 percent and a weed content not exceeding a maximum of one-
half of one percent. The seed mixture shall be not less than 85 percent, by
weight, of permanent grass, and 15 percent, by weight, of annual grass.
         c.   Sod shall be fresh cut, taken from a thick stand of permanent
lawn grass, reasonably free from weeds and coarse grass. It shall be at least
one and one-half inches thick, totally, uniform in thickness and cut in strips.
      4.   Installation. Installation of lawns and ground cover shall be as
follows:
         a.   See Section
9.35, D, 11 for finish grading
         b.   The seed or plant bed shall be prepared by scarifying the surface
lightly
         c.   Seed shall be broadcasted as recommended by the producer, but at
a rate of not less than four pounds per 1,000 square feet. The seeded ground
shall be rolled with a light roller and watered thoroughly with a fine spray.
         d.   Sod shall be laid in strips, avoiding wide joints. On slopes, sod
laying shall be started at the bottom parallel to the contour of the slope. Sod
shall be rolled with a light roller and watered thoroughly.

   F.     Storm Water Runoff Control Standards (Ord. 7-18)
      1.    In general, drainage systems shall be designed according to locally
accepted design practices and sound engineerin g judgment and shall conform to
the following:
         a.     Storm sewer design shall be sufficient to convey the design
storm discharge with an average recurrence interval of 10 years so that the
pipe flowing full condition (hydraulic grade line at the top of the pipe) is
not extended. The 25-year storm hydraulic grade line shall not exceed the
proposed ground elevation.  The 100-year storm shall be contained on-site via
an overland flow path through the on-site detention basin.
         b.   Storm sewer design shall be submitted to the City in ODOT CDSS
format, or a pre-approved alternate commercially-available software, for
the10-, 25-, and 100-year storms.
         c.   Lot grading, in-tract drainage and street improvements for all
subdivisions shall be designed so that floods having an average recurrence
interval of 100 years or less will not cause inundation or damage to any
dwellings.  A grading plan for each subdivision will be required to define the
lot grading and in-tract drainage.  All developments within areas of special
flood hazard or delineated on the official National Flood Insurance Program
Flood Insurance Rate Maps, or as determined by the City, shall comply with FEMA
design requirements.
         d.   All drainage channels, conduits and other structures located
outside the road right-of-way designed to convey public storm runoff (off-site
runoff) should be contained in suitable public easements.  Easements for open
channels shall include sufficient area along the channel banks to permit access
for maintenance equipment.  Open channels may be fenced along both sides
through urban areas where it is necessary to protect the public as well as to
prevent encroachment upon needed access areas.
      2.   Areas adjacent to open drainageways and ponds shall be graded to
preclude the entrance of storm water, except at planned locations.  Where
retention/detention areas are located on the project periphery, the developer
may be required to provide additional landscaping or screening to adequately
protect abutting properties.
      3.   Each development shall provide for the on-site or off-site detention
of excess storm water runoff resulting from that development.  For the purpose
of this section, "excess storm water runoff" shall include all increases in
storm water peak flows and volume resulting from an increase in the impervious
surface of the site, including all additions of buildings, roads and parking
lots; changes in soil absorption caused by compaction during development;
modifications in contours, including the filling or draining of small
depression areas, alterations of drainageways or regrading of slopes;
destruction of forests; the alteration of drainageways or the installation of
collection systems to intercept street flows or to replace swales or other
drainageways; or the alteration of subsurface flows, including any groundwater
dewatering or diversion practices, such as curtain drains, compared with the
site in its natural state.
      4.   Any foreseeable increase in rates and volume of site surface
drainage water runoff caused by site development shall be controlled so that
the post-development peak rate of runoff does not exceed that of the
predevelopment one-year frequency storm for all twenty-four hour storms between
a one-year frequency and the critical storm frequency as determined below.  A
recommended method which may be used to determine changes in rates and volumes
of runoff is presented in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Engineering
Division of the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, Technical Release No. 55 (Washington, D.C.: USDA, June, 1986), and
the Ohio Supplement (April, 1981).  To find the critical storm frequency for
which additional control will be needed:
         a.   The percent increase in runoff volume for a one-year frequency,
twenty-four hour storm, shall be determined; and
         b.   The critical storm frequency for which additional control is
needed shall be determined by using the percent increase in runoff volume,
derived in paragraph thereof, in the Table 9.12 below:
   Table 9.12    Critical Storm Frequency
 
Percent Increase in Runoff Volume From a One-Year
Frequency, 24 Hour Storm                          Critical Storm Frequency
Equal to or Greater Than: Less Than:              (yrs.)
-   10  1
10  20  2
20  50  5
50  100 10
100 250 25
250 500 50
500 -   100
 
      5.   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return period) than the
critical storm shall have a peak rate of runoff not greater than for the same
storm under predevelopment conditions.  For example, if the total volume is
shown to be increased by thirty-five percent, the critical storm is a five-year
storm.  The peak rate of runoff for all storms up to this intensity shall be
controlled so as not to exceed the peak rate of runoff from a one-year
frequency storm under predevelopment conditions in the area.  The runoff from a
more intense storm need only be controlled so as not to exceed the
predevelopment peak rate from the same frequency of storm.
      6.   The intent of subsections (4) and (5) above will be met if the
criteria are fulfilled for the one, two, five, twenty-five, fifty and 100-year
storms.
      7.   All detention facilities and improvements required by this section
shall comply with the following regulations:
         a.   Access easements.  An access easement shall be provided to all
detention facilities from the nearest public road so that such facilities are
accessible in case emergency maintenance work is required.  The minimum
easement width will be 10 feet.
         b.   Storage volumes.  Storage may be provided by wet or dry bottom
basins or reservoirs.
         c.   Maximum depth.  The maximum planned depth of storm water detained
shall be 5 feet, unless site conditions lend themselves to greater depths.
         d.   Outlet control structures.  Outlet control structures shall be
designed as simply as possible and shall operate automatically.  They will be
designed to limit discharges into existing or planned downstream channels or
conduits so as not to exceed the existing flow from the site in its natural
condition or as further controlled in Section
9.35(F)(4).
         e.   Spillways.  Emergency overflow facilities shall be provided
unless inflow is controlled to divert flows when the basin is at capacity.  The
spillway shall safely discharge the detention basin overflow without damage to
the detention basin.  A minimum of one foot freeboard shall be provided for the
100-year twenty-four hour storm event.
         f.   Dry bottom basins.  For basins designed without permanent pools,
the following provisions shall apply:
            i.   Interior drainage.  Provision must be made to facilitate
interior drainage, including the provision of natural grades to outlet
structures, longitudinal and transverse grades to perimeter drainage facilities
or the installation of subsurface drains.
            ii.   Multipurpose features.  These may be designed to serve
secondary purposes for recreation, open space or other types of use which will
not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent flooding.
            iii.   Cleaning.  The basins shall be designed for periodic
cleaning and removal of sediments, which shall be removed from the site or
otherwise disposed of in an appropriate manner.
         g.   Wet basins. For basins designed with permanent pools, the
following provisions shall apply:
            i.   Depth for fish.  If fish are used to help keep the basin
clean, at least one-quarter of the area of the permanent pool must have a
minimum depth of ten feet.
            ii.   Facilities for emptying.  For emergency purposes, cleaning or
shoreline maintenance, facilities shall be provided or plans prepared for the
use of auxiliary equipment to permit emptying and drainage.
            iii.   Pollution abatement.  Aeration facilities may be required
when the quality of the influent and detention time would result in a lowering
of dissolved oxygen content in the basin.
            iv.   Slopes.  Approach slopes shall be at least six to one, but
not more than three to one, and shall be at least four to six feet wide and
slope gently toward the basin.  The side slopes shall be of non-erosive
material with a slope of one to one or flatter.  The ledge shall be four to six
feet wide and slope gently toward the shore to prevent people or objects from
sliding into deep water.  There shall be a freeboard of twelve to eighteen
inches above the high-water elevation on all retention basins.  Alternative
designs for side slopes may be considered under special circumstances where
good engineering practice is demonstrated.
            v.   Cleaning.  The basins shall be designed to include sediment
traps in all inlets.  Sediment traps shall be designed to permit periodic
cleaning and maintenance.  A basin maintenance plan shall be developed to
insure that the design depths of the basin will remain over time.

IMAGES/0-0-0-282.png]
 
         h.    Building regulations.
             i.   Parking lot storage.  Paved parking lots may be designed to
provide temporary detention storage of storm water on a portion of their
surfaces.  Outlets shall be designed to empty the stored waters slowly, and
depths of storage must be limited so as to prevent damage to parked vehicles,
and storage areas shall be posted with warning signs.
             ii.    Detention storage.  All or a portion of the detention
storage may also be provided in underground detention facilities, provided that
they meet the design regulations of Section
9.35, F, 7, b and c.
            iii.   Off-site easements.  Off-site easements for storm water
management facilities will be required when either of the following conditions
exists:
               1)   The discharge is into any man-made facility for which the
City does not have either a drainage easement or right-of-way.
               2)   The discharge is into a natural system such that the rate
or character (i.e. sheet flow versus concentrated flow) of the flow at the
property line has been changed.  The easement will be required to a point at
which natural conditions are duplicated.
            iv.   Design criteria for off-site drainage.  Off-site areas which
drain to or across a site proposed for development must be accommodated in the
storm water management plans for the development.  The storm water management
system for the development must be capable of transporting existing off-site
flows through or around the development without increasing stages or flows
upstream or downstream of the development.  The estimation of the off-site
flows must be done separately from the estimation of on-site pre- and post-
development flows (i.e. separate off-site and on-site hydrographs must be
computed due to the typically significant differences in land use
characteristics).
            v.   Alternatives to detention or retention ponds.  For sites
containing less than 10,000 square feet of total impervious surface,
alternatives to detention or retention ponds that utilize landscaped buffers
and swale drainage as a means of attenuating the rate of runoff are encouraged,
provided that it can be shown that applicable design and performance criteria
are met.
            vi.   Protection of detention and retention facilities from
erosion.  Measures shall be taken to protect the embankment of detention and
retention facilities from erosion and provide a definitive protective flow path
downstream of the facility.
   G.   Off-Site Drainage Facilities
      1.   The City may allow or require surface water runoff to be discharged
into drainage facilities off the site of development if all of the following
conditions are met:
         a.   The drainage facilities are constructed and maintained in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
         b.   Adequate provision is made for acquisition, construction and
operating costs of the off-site drainage facilities.
         c.   A request to use these drainage facilities and all information
relating to these proposed drainage facilities is made a part of the
developer's application.
      2.   The City may allow or require payment of a fee for redevelopment
activities in lieu of constructing a detention or retention facility as
specified in Section
9.35, F. Payment received in lieu of redevelopment detention or retention shall
be used for storm water improvement projects, including the establishment of
regional detention systems.  The fee shall be based on an amount per square
foot of impervious surface (on-site).
      3.   Whenever deemed practical, necessary and in the public interest, the
City may acquire land and construct these drainage facilities, and, to the
greatest extent possible, the fees and charges for such facilities shall be
sufficient to cover all costs associated therewith and such facilities shall be
self-supporting.
   H.   Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan
      1.   In order to prevent both soil erosion and sedimentation, a soil
erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be required whenever a development
will involve any clearing, grading, transporting or other form of disturbing
the land by the movement of earth. The requirements promulgated by the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) in Permit No. OHC000004 (or most recent
revision) are to be satisfied in a Stormwater and Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP). (Ord. 17-14)
      2.   Sediment deposition caused by accelerated storm water runoff over a
development site or by accelerated erosion due to the sloughing or sliding of
surface soil that has been exposed by grading, dumping, stockpiling or any
other excavation-related earth disturbances shall be retarded and confined to
within the boundaries of the development site.
      3.   The accumulative monthly predicted amounts of gross soil loss
anticipated from sheet and rill erosion shall be abated to within an average
annual rate of fifteen tons per acre during the first year, ten tons per acre
for any year thereafter of site development activities and to within five tons
per acre per year after site development is completed.  The Universal Soil Loss
Equation, as referenced in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil
Conservation Service (SCS), Water Management and Sediment Control for
Urbanizing Areas, (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, June,
1978), or other approved methods, shall be used to predict average annual rates
of gross soil loss by month from a development site.
      4.   Specifically, the following protection shall be provided for all
disturbed areas: minimize velocities of water runoff, maximize protection of
disturbed areas from storm water runoff and retain sedimentation within the
development site as early as possible following disturbances.  A list of major
problem areas for erosion and sedimentation control follows.  For each one, the
purpose of requiring control is described.  Soil erosion and sedimentation
control measures for all such areas shall be provided with a view toward
achieving the specific purpose listed below for which a control plan is
required:
         a.   Erodible slopes: prevent detachment and transportation of soil
particles from such slopes.
         b.   Streams, streambeds, streambanks, bodies of water, lake
shorelines: prevent detachment and transportation of soil particles.
         c.   Drainageways: prevent detachment and transportation of soil
particles (which would otherwise deposit in streams, bodies of water or
wetlands); promote deposit of sediment loads (traversing these areas) before
they reach bodies of water.
         d.   Land adjacent to streams, ponds, lakes and wetlands: prevent
detachment and transportation of soil particles.
         e.   Enclosed drainage structures: prevent sedimentation in a
structure, erosion at the outfall of the system and the deposit of sediment
loads within the system or beyond it.
         f.   Large flat surface areas (unpaved): prevent detachment of soil
particles and their off-site transportation.
         g.   Pervious surfaces: prevent the detachment and transportation of
soil (in response to an increase in the rate and/or volume of runoff of the
site or its concentration caused by impervious surfaces).
         h.   Borrow and stockpile areas: divert runoff from the face of slopes
which are exposed in the excavation process; convey runoff in stabilized
channels to stable disposal points; and leave borrow areas and stockpiles in
stable condition.
         i.   Adjacent properties: prevent their erosion and/or the deposit
thereon of sediment.
   I.   Runoff Control and Sediment Abatement Plans
      1.   Any person seeking approval of a development proposal shall:
         a.   Submit a SWPPP per the requirements and recommendations of the
OEPA Permit No. OHC000004 (or most recent revision) and the Rainwater
Development Manual; (Ord. 17-14)
         b.   Provide mapped information about the location and vicinity of the
area proposed for development;
         c.   Furnish the following three types of information and maps about
the proposed land development and site location:
            i.   An existing characteristics inventory;

            iii.   An abatement control plan.
         d.   Minor additions to existing facilities may be exempted from this
requirement by the City Engineer.
      2.   Specifically, all proposed land developments shall have plans or
maps of an appropriate scale that depict existing and proposed improvements,
including, but not limited to:
         a.   Structures, streets, sidewalks, driveways, parking lots, storm
drainage systems and appurtenances, utilities, poles, etc.
         b.   Elevations, contour lines, inverts of sewers and drainage
facilities, etc.
         c.   The location of the boundary of the 100-year flood plain.
      3.   Runoff control and sediment abatement plan content requirements
shall be as follows:
         a.   A runoff control and sediment abatement plan shall identify how
accelerated surface water runoff, increased erosion and sediment deposition
induced by site development are to be controlled to within the abatement
standards set forth in Section
9.35, F and Section
9.35, H. The developer's engineer shall include in the construction plans a
master drainage map showing all existing and proposed features.  The map is to
be prepared on a twenty-four inch by thirty-six inch sheet on a scale not to
exceed one inch equals 100 feet.  Listed below are the features that are to be
included on the drainage map:
            i.   Drainage boundaries, including all areas draining to the
proposed subdivision or development.

completed in accordance to the approved storm water management plan.  Prior to
final inspection, the developer's engineer shall provide as-built plans of the
detention facilities and outlet control structures, documenting facilities that
are constructed substantially in accordance with approved plans.
         c.   After each inspection the inspector shall complete a site
development status report.  If the inspector finds that operations are being
conducted by a permittee in violation of an approved plan or provisions of this
chapter, a stop-work order may be issued at that time.
      4.   Privately Owned Installations.
         a.   Design, Inspection and Maintenance.  Permanent runoff control and
sediment abatement installations which are to be privately owned and maintained
by an individual or group of property owners shall be:
            i.   Designed and constructed by the permittee with easements
sufficient to allow adequate access for inspections, maintenance and corrective
actions, if necessary, by the City.
            ii.   Inspected as needed by the City to ensure that privately-
owned installations are being properly maintained. If not, the City may compel
the owners to make the necessary repairs at the expense of the owner.
            iii.   Maintained as installed by the permitted according to the
approved design and not altered unless such alteration is approved by the City.
         b.   Legal/Operation Entity Requirements.
            i.   Acceptable entities.  The City considers the following
entities acceptable to operate and maintain runoff and sediment control
facilities:
               1)   The City; and
               2)   Non-profit corporations, including homeowners'
associations, property owners' associations, condominium owners' associations
or master associations.
            ii.   The property owner or developer is normally not acceptable as
a responsible entity, especially when the property is to be sold to various
third parties.  However, the property owner or developer may be acceptable
under one of the following circumstances:
               1)   The property is wholly owned by said property owner or
developer and is intended to be so retained.  This would apply to a farm,
corporate office or single industrial facility for example.
               2)   The ownership of the property is retained by the owner or
developer and is either leased to third parties, such as in some shopping
centers, or rented to third parties, such as in some mobile home parks for
example.  To satisfy this requirement, the owner or developer must provide
written documentation.
            iii.   Association requirements.
               1)   If a homeowners' or property owners' association or master
application is proposed, the developer must submit the articles of
incorporation for the association and the declaration of protective covenants
or deed restrictions, as well as a reference map if such is referred to in the
documents.  After these are approved, the developer must furnish the
certificate of incorporation and the recording information (official book and
page number) for the declaration.
               2)   If a condominium association is proposed, the developer
must supply the articles of incorporation for the condominium association and
the declaration of condominium.  After the documents are approved by the City,
including stormwater management plan, it will be necessary for the developer to
forward a copy of the letter from the County Recorder's Office stating that the
documents are proper for filing.  The association, be it either a non-profit
association or a condominium association, must comply with the applicable
provisions of State law.
               3)   The association must have the following general powers
which are reflected in the articles of incorporation:
                  a.   Own and convey property.
                  b.   Operate and maintain common property, specifically the
surface water management system as permitted by the City, including all lakes,
retention areas, culverts and related appurtenances.
                  c.   Establish rules and regulations.
                  d.   Assess members and enforce said assessments.
                  e.   Sue and be sued.
                  f.   Contract for services (if the association contemplates
employing a maintenance company) to provide the services for operation and
maintenance.
                  g.   Have as members all the homeowners, lot owners, property
owners or unit owners.
                  h.   Exist in perpetuity.  However, if the association is
dissolved, the articles of incorporation must provide that the property
consisting of the surface water management system shall be conveyed to an
appropriate agency of local government.  If it is not accepted, then the
surface water management system must be dedicated to a similar non-profit
corporation.
                  i.   All other powers necessary for the purposes for which
the association is organized.
            iv.   The declaration of protective covenants, deed restrictions or
declaration of condominium must set forth the following:
               1)   That it is the responsibility of the association to operate
and maintain the surface water management system.
               2)   That the surface water management system is owned by the
association or described therein as common property.
               3)   That there is a method of assessing and collecting the
assessment for the operation and maintenance of the surface water management
system.
               4)   That any amendment which would affect the surface water
management system, including the water management portions of the common areas,
must have the prior approval of the City.
               5)   That the declaration of protective covenants be in effect
for at least twenty-five years with automatic renewal periods thereafter.
            v.   If the documents are not submitted with the original
application, they must be submitted and approved prior to construction.  It is
advised that the documents be submitted prior to recording to allow comment by
the Municipal Attorney.  Modification of these requirements can only be based
upon:
               1)   Intervening local government requirements of a more
stringent nature, such as the requirement of a maintenance agreement and
posting of bond by the developer.
               2)   The uniqueness of the project requiring an alternative
entity.  Such alternative entity must be evaluated upon an individual basis
with any and all necessary agreements or easements in effect before approval
will be given.

   B.   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
      1.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      2.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      4.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,

Centerville boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Centerville suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the City of Centerville has assumed
or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   R.   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
      1.   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      2.   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased, base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      3.   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         a.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         b.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      4.   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
5.19, Appeal Procedure of this UDO.
      5.   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations of flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   S.   Substantial Damage Determinations
      1.   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         a.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         b.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         c.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      2.   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the flood
plain development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with
other federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

9.41   Antennae
   A.   Purpose
      This Section is intended to comply with federal law, policies and
guidelines. This Section is also intended to comply with federal policies and
guidelines in that it does not differentiate among types of antennae. This
Section is also intended to comply with the policies and guidelines and of
state and federal laws including the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 in
that it does not intend to impair the installation, maintenance, or use of
antennae. However, this section is intended to preserve the city's right to
reasonably restrict placement of antennae in order to preserve historic
districts, including without limitations the consideration of aesthetic issues
other than historic considerations such as the relative height of structures
and trees, views, preservation of residential areas, property value.
      This section is also intended to comply with state and federal law to the
degree permitted and intended to comply with the Secretary of the Interior's
Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic
Buildings, which recommends against:
      "Introducing new construction onto the building site that is visually
incompatible in terms of size, scale, design, materials, color and texture or
which destroys historic relationships on the site." According to Federal
Regulation 36 CFR 800.5 (a) (1), the installation of an antenna is considered
to alter, either directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a
historic property for inclusion in the National Register in a manner that would
diminish the integrity of the property's location, design, setting, materials,
workmanship, feelings, or association, diminishing the integrity of the
property's historic features.
   B.   Public Health, Safety and Welfare Objectives
      The City Council intends to protect the public health, safety and welfare
of the citizens of the City from potential hazards and damage to property
values and/or community character associated with the installation and
maintenance of antennae within the City. Of particular concern is the
preservation of the character of the Architectural Preservation District (APD)
or a landmark property. The restrictions and standards herein are intended to
assure that all antennae installations are adequately constructed and located
so as to minimize potential detrimental effects associated with such
installations.
      1.   Antennae shall be permitted as follows subject to the other
requirements herein, including the requirements for structures located in the
APD or on a landmark property:
         a.   One (1) private non-commercial antenna, including satellite
receiving dishes of one meter or less and antennae designed to receive
television broadcast signals, shall be permitted for each dwelling unit in all
Districts.
         b.   One private non-commercial antenna serving a specific structure
type, whether reception or transmission, is permitted per multiple-family
building.
         c.   Two private non-commercial antenna serving a specific structure
type, whether reception or transmission, is permitted per commercial use,
whether freestanding or part of a multi-use building.
         d.   Antennae for the purpose of receiving RF signals and for amateur
or "ham radio" transmitting are permitted in all districts.
      2.   Any antenna which does not fit into the above antennae types shall
require a Conditional Use Permit.
   C.   Size and Location Restrictions
      1.   All antennae shall be attached to the principle structure unless
there is no practical placement location as determined by the City Planner.
      2.   Satellite dishes less than 1 meter in diameter and television
broadcast antennae are exempt from a permit but have locational regulations:
         a.   Mounted to a principle structure: each antenna shall be located
on that portion of a hip, gable, or gambrel roof which does not face a public
street and shall be mounted behind the highest roof peak on the main structure.
On flat roofs an antenna shall be located in a way so as to minimize its
visibility from other properties. If affixed to the structure of buildings
within the historic district, antennae and dishes must be installed to avoid
damage, such that if the antenna is removed, it shall not have permanently
altered the structure. When affixed to a masonry structure, antennae must be
attached to the mortar joints, not to the face of the stone or brick.
         b.   Free-standing mounted in the ground: location is limited to the
side or rear yard only and the maximum length or diameter of any television
broadcast antenna, exclusive of structural supports, shall not exceed 10 feet.
      3.   Antennae Anchored to Principal Structure
         a.   All antennae shall be attached to the principle structure unless
there is no practical placement location as determined by the City Planner. The
following regulations shall apply to all antennae which are affixed to the main
structure except as provided above on any parcel, including but not limited to
roof mounted antennae and towers which are mounted in the ground and affixed to
the main structure for support. Antennae mounted on or affixed to detached
garages and other accessory structures are not permitted in the City of
Centerville.
         b.   Dimension:  The maximum length or diameter of any television
broadcast antenna, exclusive of structural supports, shall not exceed 10 feet.
         c.   Mounting:  Each antenna shall be located on that portion of a
hip, gable, or gambrel roof which does not face a public street and shall be
mounted behind the highest roof peak on the main structure. On flat roofs an
antenna shall be located in a way so as to minimize its visibility from other
properties. If affixed to the structure of buildings within the historic
district, antennae and dishes must be installed to avoid damage, such that if
the antenna is removed, it shall not have permanently altered the structure.
When affixed to a masonry structure, antennae must be attached to the mortar
joints, not to the face of the stone or brick.
         d.   No antennae including structural supports shall exceed 10 feet
above a roof line.
      4.   Free Standing Antennae
         a.   The City Planner shall determine whether a free-standing antenna
is a suitable alternative to being mounted or anchored to the principle
structure. The City Planner must consider other practical locations mounted or
anchored to the principle structure before considering a free-standing
location.
         b.   The following regulations shall apply to all free standing
antennae, which are those antennae mounted in the ground, with or without guy
wires.
            i.   Freestanding antennae shall be constructed only in the rear
yard between the side yard setbacks and no closer than 10 feet to any property
line.
            ii.   Free standing antennae which are transmitting and/or
receiving antennae shall not be higher than 10 feet above the roof line of the
main structure.
            iii.   Free standing antennae, capable of receiving transmissions
only shall not exceed 10 square feet in area.
   D.   Aesthetic and Screening Requirements
      1.   All free standing antennae shall be substantially screened by
evergreen trees or shrubbery of at least the height of the unit, such screening
may be open on 1 side to facilitate reception.
      2.   The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed location is such
that during all seasons, no part of any ground mounted antennae structure will
be visible to the neighbors and the general public from a point that is between
the ground level and 6 feet above ground level on surrounding property. This
provision is satisfied by the installation of evergreen plantings, which shall
screen the antennae at the time of installation.
      3.   Antennae shall be of a color compatible with the surrounding
landscape and structures, provided such antennae above the roof line may be of
the natural color of the antennae structure.
   E.   Structural Safety Requirements
      The following structural safety requirements shall be applied to all
antenna installations. The Building Department shall review antenna
applications as required by the Building Code for conformance to these
requirements.
      1.   If guy wires are used, they shall be sufficiently visible to prevent
accident or injury to any person.
      2.   Every antenna shall be constructed in accordance with the Building
Code of the City, as amended, including the electrical provisions thereof and
shall also comply with specifications of the manufacturer.
   F.   Permit Required Application Requirements
      All antennae, except for satellite receiving dishes of one meter or less
and antennae designed to receive television broadcast and signals, shall be
considered accessory structures and may only be installed upon obtaining a
building permit from the Building Department, if necessary, and a code
compliance check from the City Planner.
      For all antennae other than a satellite receiving dish of one meter or
less and antenna designed to receive television broadcast signals; the
applicant must provide:
      1.   A plot plan showing proposed location and dish projection at
extremes of the satellite band to be viewed.
      2.   Landscape plan showing existing and proposed vegetation for
completely screening the installation from the neighboring and street view.
      3.   A description of the use and purpose of the antenna, including
whether it is receive-only, transmitting-only, or both.
   G.   Impairment of Reception, Line of Sight and Technical Problems
      1.   The above regulations are not intended to impair the reception of an
acceptable quality signal for satellite viewing dishes of one meter or less and
an alternative location or landscape plan shall be permitted when it is shown
that they would result in such impairment.
      2.   The City Planner may consider alternate locations for an antenna
which does not comply with this UDO, provided that the applicant has proven
that such antenna will be entirely inoperable otherwise for any useful purpose,
for reasons of "line of sight" or other technical reasons, or for reasons set
forth in federal law or regulations.
9.43   Home Occupations
   A.   Purpose

the home occupation may schedule appointments with clients or customers, but no
more than 2 clients or customers per hour.  An exception to this requirement is
for Direct Sale of Consumer Products or Service where parties for the purpose
of taking orders or selling merchandise shall not be held more often than 6
times per year.
      9.   A home occupation shall produce no heat, sound, vibration, light,
glare, dust, odor, smoke, or fumes detectable to normal sensory perception by a
person located off the premises or beyond the walls of the dwelling unit if the
dwelling unit is a part of a multi-family building.
      10.   A home occupation shall not create a hazard to person or property,
result in electrical interference to nearby neighborhood machinery or
equipment, or become a nuisance. Storage of any hazardous or toxic materials in
quantities that could have a potentially significant environmental impact on
the property or on the surrounding community is prohibited.

9.47   Parklands
   A.   Findings and Statement of Policy
      1.   Findings
      It is found and determined that the public health, safety, convenience,
comfort, prosperity and general welfare require that at least seventeen acres
of property for each 1,000 persons residing within the planning jurisdiction,
as defined in this chapter, be devoted to parkland, and the same is hereby
established as the parkland standard for all purposes of this chapter.  The
parkland standard utilized in this chapter was determined by computing the
approximate existing ratio of parkland to population within the Centerville-
Washington Park District (hereinafter referred to as "the Park District").
      2.   Statement of Policy
      With respect to subdivisions and developments to which this chapter
applies, at least eight and one-half acres of property for each 1,000 persons
(.0085 acres per person) should be reserved for parkland by or at the expense
of the subdivider or developer of the dwellings in which such persons shall
reside, and the remainder of the seventeen-acre standard established in this
chapter shall be acquired for such purposes by the Park District or the City. 
All parkland reserved or acquired under this chapter shall be developed and
maintained by the Park District or the City.
   B.   Adoption of Park Plan
   The Planning Commission shall adopt a plan for the parks and other public
open grounds of the City, which may constitute a part of a Comprehensive
Development Plan and which shall provide a guide for the orderly acquisition of
parkland within the planning jurisdiction, in accordance with the parkland
standard set forth in this chapter, the criteria set forth in this chapter and
such other criteria as the Planning Commission may deem appropriate to
accomplish the purposes of this chapter.  In adopting the plan for the parks,
the Planning Commission shall take into consideration the Master Plan of the
Centerville-Washington Park District.
   C.   Provision of Parkland by Subdividers or Developers
   Every subdivider or developer who files with the Planning Commission any
proposal, plan or plat for the subdivision or development of land within the
planning jurisdiction after a date which shall be the later of a date 30 days
after the effective date of this chapter, or the date of the adoption of the
plan for the parks referred to in this chapter, and who has not theretofore so
filed any preliminary plat with respect to such subdivision or development or a
development plan, shall either dedicate a portion of such land, pay a fee in
lieu of land dedication, or dedicate land and pay a fee in lieu of land
dedication, all as provided in this chapter, for the purpose of providing
parkland to serve future residents of each such subdivision or development.
   D.   Determination of Total Population
      1.   Population Factor. For purposes of this chapter, a population factor
for each dwelling unit planned for a subdivision or development shall be
determined as follows:
Table 9.13
 
Residential Dwelling Type                 Population Factor Per Dwelling Unit
Single-family                             3.25
Two-family                                2.50
Multifamily Unit (restricted to a maximum 1.00
family size of one person)
All other units                           1.75
 
      2.   Total population. Total population for any subdivision or
development shall equal the sum of the population factors of all dwelling units
to be included in the subdivision or development.  For purposes of this
chapter, the Planning Commission shall determine the number and types of
dwellings to be included in any subdivision or development on the basis of such
relevant information as it may have or be able to obtain tending to show the
same, including, without limitation, any plans, estimates or statements of
intention furnished by the subdivider or developer concerned relating to the
proposed improvement of the subdivision or development, the nature and
topography of the land involved and the nature and kind of improvements
actually planned or probable thereon.
   E.   Determination of Land Dedication or Payment of Fee for Provision of
Parkland
      1.   Determination by Planning Commission
      The Planning Commission shall determine whether a subdivider shall
dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu of land dedication or provide a combination of
land dedication and fee payment.
      2.   Procedure
      In making the determination referred to in subsection (a) hereof, the
following procedure shall apply:
         a.   Contents of filings: At the time of filing a preliminary plat,
final plat or development plan for approval, each subdivider or developer
shall, as a part of such filing, submit a calculation of the total population
of the plat or development in accordance with Section
1204.05 and indicate whether he or she plans to dedicate land as parkland, to
pay a fee in lieu of dedication or to meet the requirements of this chapter by
a combination of parkland dedication and fee payment. If such subdivider or
developer plans to dedicate land, he or she shall indicate the area he or she
desires to dedicate on the preliminary plat, final plat or development plan.
         b.   Planning Commission determination: After the Planning Commission
has reviewed such preliminary plat, final plat or development plan, and after
review of the same with the Park District, it shall determine whether the plans
of the subdivider or developer to dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu of
dedication or provide a combination of dedication and fee payment, are
acceptable, provided that the Planning Commission shall make the determination
so required within 60 days of the submission, unless the developer or his or
her representative agrees to an extended period for such determination.  If the
Planning Commission fails to make a determination within said time period, or
within any agreed extension period, such submission shall be deemed to be
approved.  Insofar as practicable, the determination of the Planning Commission
shall be compatible with the plan for the parks.
         c.   Adverse effects of development; reclamation. If, in the opinion
of the Planning Commission, any portion of land proposed for dedication has
been, or will be, adversely affected by the operations of a subdivider or
developer, and such land or portion thereof will require reclamation in order
to render it suitable as parkland, the Planning Commission may require the
subdivider or developer to furnish a plan for such reclamation.  The Planning
Commission shall seek the advice of the City Engineer and the Park District
with respect to any such plan, and shall determine, on the basis of such
advice, whether such plan is acceptable in view of the purposes of this
chapter.  In the event that such plan is acceptable, the subdivider or
developer concerned shall implement such plan in accordance with a timetable
approved by the Planning Commission. The City may, without prejudicing any
rights the City may have at law or in equity, deny approval of a final plat for
non-compliance with a previously approved reclamation plan or timetable
involving that plat.
            Commentary:   A final plat shall not refer to the plat of the last
section of an approved preliminary plat, but shall refer to any final map of
all or a portion of a subdivision which is submitted to the City for final
approval before recording at the office of the County Recorder.
         d.   Criteria: In making its determination, the Planning Commission
shall utilize the following criteria:
            i.   Unity.  Dedicated land must form a single parcel of land of
not less than five acres in area, except in the event that the Planning
Commission determines that two or more parcels of not less than five acres each
would be in the best public interest or in the event that a parcel of less than
five acres adjoins an existing or proposed park to provide a facility of five
acres or more.
            ii.   Shape and topography.  The shape and topography of the
dedicated parcel of land shall be suitable for active and/or passive recreation
to serve the public properly as determined by the Planning Commission after
review with the Park District.
            iii.   Location.  Dedicated land must be located in order to serve
the recreation and open space needs of the subdivision or development for which
the dedication was made.
            iv.   Access.  Public access and maintenance access to five acres
of dedicated parkland shall be provided by adjoining frontage of 400 or more
feet at one location on a public street with street improvements, sidewalks and
utilities installed by and at the expense of the developer, and as determined
by the Planning Commission, by public walkways installed by and at the expense
of the developer.  Frontage shall be increased by at least forty feet for each
additional acre of parkland.
            v.   Preservation of natural beauty.  In all instances, natural
features of scenic beauty, such as trees, plant life, brooks and other
watercourses, topography, historic locations, views and similar conditions,
which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the dedicated land,
shall be considered and preserved in the dedication of parkland.
   F.   Amount of Land to be Dedicated
      1.   The amount of land to be dedicated by a subdivider or developer
pursuant to this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the following
formula:
 
                                  Total Population as
Acres of Land for Dedication   determined in accordance      0.0085 Acres
                                  with Section
                                  9.47(D)
 
   G.   Determination of fee in lieu of dedication
      1.   Amount. In the event the Planning Commission determines that a
subdivider or developer shall pay a fee in lieu of land dedication, the amount
of such fee shall be determined by the following formula:
 
                         Land area otherwise required
Fee-in-lieu of Land   to be dedicated pursuant to    Market Value
Dedication               Section
                         9.47(F)
 
      2.   Determination of Market Value. Market value shall be determined in
accordance with Section
9.47(I).
   H.   Park Development and Maintenance
   Park development and maintenance shall be provided by the Park District or
the City.
   I.   Determination of Market Value
      1.   Time for determination. Market value shall be determined as of the
time of filing the final plat or the final plat of the first section of an
approved preliminary plat, at the time of filing of a development plan, with
the City.
         Commentary: A final plat shall not refer to the plat of the last
section of an approved preliminary plat, but shall refer to any final map of
all or a portion of a subdivision which is submitted to the City for final
approval before recording at the office of the County Recorder.
      2.   Method of determination. Market value shall equal the average value
per acre of all land in each subdivision or development in its raw, undeveloped
state, plus one-half the cost of installation of 400 feet of public street,
sidewalk and utility improvements in the subdivision for the first five acres
of park area plus forty feet of public street, sidewalk and utility
improvements for each additional acre, determined by application of one of the
following procedures:
         a.   By agreement between the subdivider or developer and the Planning
Commission, which may include appraisal by a qualified independent appraiser
approved by the Planning Commission; or
         b.   In the event that the subdivider or developer objects to the
foregoing method or valuation, by a three-member board of appraisers, one of
whom shall be appointed by the Planning Commission, one of whom shall be
appointed by the subdivider or developer, and one of whom shall be selected by
the two appraisers so appointed.  The decision of a majority of such board
shall be final.  The Park District or the City shall pay the cost of the
board's appraisal.
   J.   Credit for Private Open Space
      1.   Allowance of credit. In the event that a subdivider or developer
provides private open space for park purposes and such space is to be privately
owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision or development,
or by the subdivider or developer, and in the event that the Planning
Commission determines that such private open space adequately fulfills a
portion of the park needs of the proposed subdivision or development, the
market value of such areas, as determined in Section
9.47, I, shall be credited against the land dedication or fee in lieu of
dedication of land requirements of this chapter.
      2.   Maximum credit. Such credit, however, shall be allowed only up to a
maximum of one-half of the total required land dedication or fee in lieu of
dedication requirement.  The remaining one-half shall be provided in accordance
with the requirements of this chapter.
      3.   Standards and limitations. Notwithstanding subsections 1 and 2
hereof, the credit for private open space shall be allowed only if all of the
following standards are met:
         a.   Yards, court areas, setbacks and other such open areas required
to be maintained by the UDO shall not be included in the computation of such
private open space.
         b.   Private ownership, development and maintenance of the private
open space shall be assured by valid and enforceable undertakings on the part
of the subdivider or developer, or otherwise.
         c.   The use of the private open space is restricted for park purposes
by recorded covenants that run with the land in favor of the future owners of
property within the subdivision or development, and which cannot by their terms
be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the Planning Commission.
         d.   The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for park
uses, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography,
geology, access and location of the private open space land.
         e.   Facilities proposed for the private open space can be reasonably
expected to meet the needs of the future residents.
   K.   Treatment of Land to be Dedicated; Procedure for Dedication of Land and
Payment of Fees
      1.   Following approval of a preliminary plat, final plat or development
plan which designates land for dedication, the existing vegetation (except
growing commercial crops other than growing timber), topography, features of
historic value, stream courses, soil, rock strata and other natural features of
such dedicated land, shall not be altered or their condition adversely affected
in any way without the consent of the Planning Commission.
      2.   Dedication of land to the Park District or the City shall be by a
general warranty deed conveying to the Park District or the City, and their
successors and assigns, good and marketable title to the real estate described
in such deed, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
         a.   This deed shall be executed and delivered to the Park District or
the City for recording prior to the signing by the City of the final plat,
prior to the signing of a final plat of the first section of an approved
preliminary plat, or prior to the issuance by the City of any permit allowing
implementation of an approved development plan.
         b.   In the case where the final plat is the first section of an
approved preliminary plat, the City may permit the developer to place the deed
to the parkland in escrow for later delivery to the Park District or the City
at the time of approval of the final plat of the last section of an approved
preliminary plat.  However, if any final plat is submitted for approval that
includes or has a boundary contiguous with the proposed park, the deed (whether
in escrow or not) transferring the parkland to the Park District or the City
shall be recorded prior to the signing by the City of that final plat.
         c.   Open space covenants for private parks shall be submitted to the
City Council prior to approval of the final plat or development plan and shall
be recorded at the same time as the final plat or prior to the issuance of any
City permit allowing implementation of an approved development plan.
      3.   If a fee in lieu of dedication is required, the amount thereof shall
be deposited with the City prior to the signing by the City of the final plat
or prior to the issuance by the City of any permit allowing implementation of
an approved development plan.
         a.   In the case where the final plat is a section of an approved
preliminary plat, only a proportionate amount of the total fee in lieu of
dedication for the approved preliminary plat shall be paid prior to the signing
of each approved final plat which is a section of that preliminary plat.
         b.   In the case of a permit allowing implementation of a portion of
an approved development plan, only a proportionate amount of the total fee in
lieu of dedication for that approved development plan shall be paid.
         Commentary:  A final plat shall not refer to the plat of the last
section of an approved preliminary plat, but shall refer to any final map of
all or a portion of a subdivision which is submitted to the City for final
approval before recording at the office of the County Recorder.
   L.   Amendments of Approved Plats or Development Plans
      1.   Any amendment of an approved plat or development plan which, under
the provisions of this chapter, increases the requirement for parkland
dedication or payment of a fee in lieu of parkland dedication by a developer,
shall require that such increased parkland be dedicated or that such fee in
lieu of such increased parkland be paid by the developer in compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.
      2.   Any amendment of an approved plat or development plan which, under
the provisions of this chapter, decreases the requirement for parkland
dedication or payment of a fee in lieu of parkland dedication by a developer,
shall not require the deeding by the Park District or the City of any
previously dedicated parkland back to the developer, the alteration of any deed
placed in escrow or any escrow agreement that was a requirement of this
chapter, or the repayment to the developer of any fee in lieu of parkland
dedication already paid by the developer to the Park District or the City.
   M.   Limitation on Use of Land and Fees
   Any land or fees received by the Park District or the City pursuant to this
chapter shall be used only for the purpose of providing parkland to properly
serve the future residents of the subdivision or development concerned.  Fees
paid pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited in a Park District or City
fund to be used only for the acquisition of parkland within the City or
adjacent to the City.  No part of such fees shall be used for the purpose of
development or for paying salaries, wages or other general operating
expenditures.  No deed or fee shall be deposited with the Park District or the
City until such time as the Park District or the City certifies that it shall
develop and permanently maintain any parkland acquired under the terms of this
chapter and shall use fees only for the acquisition of land under the terms of
this chapter.
   N.   Reduction of minimum lot area and minimum lot frontage requirements.
   Reduction of minimum lot area and minimum lot frontage requirements by the
dedication of additional parkland or the payment of an additional fee in lieu
of dedication shall be as provided in the supplemental zoning district
requirements of the UDO.

3.15, Ordinance Enforcement and Penalties.
9.49   Sexually Oriented Business Standards
   A.   Purpose and Findings
      1.   Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare
of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually
oriented businesses within the City. The provisions of this Section have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this Section to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this Section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.

Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota); and on testimony to
Congress in 136 Cong. Rec. S. 8987; 135 Cong. Rec. S. 14519; 135 Cong. Rec. S.
5636, 134 Cong. Rec. E. 3750; and also on findings from the paper entitled
"Stripclubs According to Strippers: Exposing Workplace Sexual Violence," by
Kelly Holsopple, Program Adult Entertainment Director, Freedom and Justice
Center for Prostitution Resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota; and from "Sexually
Oriented Businesses: An Insider's View," by David Sherman, presented to the
Michigan House Committee on Ethics and Constitutional Law, Jan. 12, 2000; and
from various other police reports, testimony, newspaper reports, and other
documentary evidence, the City Council finds:
         a.   Adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the
operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no statewide
mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the
activities that occur on their premises.
         b.   Certain employees of adult entertainment establishments, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 3768.01 as adult theaters and cabarets, engage in a higher
incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
         c.   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur
at adult entertainment establishments, especially those that provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
The "couch dances" or "lap dances" that frequently occur in adult entertainment
establishments featuring live nude or seminude dancers constitute or may
constitute the offense of "engaging in prostitution" under Ohio R.C. 2907.25.
         d.   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities,
which creates unhealthy conditions.
         e.   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sexual
activity within the premises of those adult entertainment establishments.
         f.   Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections,
chlamydial, myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis, and
chancroid.
         g.   Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States: 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983,
4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985, and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
         h.   A total of 10,255 AIDS cases had been reported in Ohio as of
January 1999. Ohio has required HIV case reporting since 1990, and the reported
information shows 7,969 people living with (HIV) (4,213) and (AIDS) (3,756) in
the state.
         i.   Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in
Ohio.

infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts.
         n.   Sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment establishments
are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy,

those activities and maintain those facilities.
         o.   The findings noted in divisions 2. a) to n) of this section raise
substantial governmental concerns.

         c.   Architectural features shall not project into the public right-
of-way.
   C.   Architectural Standards for Non-Residential Land Uses
      1.   Purpose
      The goal of these regulations is to encourage development that
contributes to the City of Centerville as a unique place, reflecting the
community's physical character and adding to it in appropriate ways.  The
architectural design of non-residential developments, particularly large-scale
developments, determines much of the character and attractiveness along the
thoroughfares of the City, the  windows to our Community.  These standards
require a basic level of architectural variety, detail siding and roof
materials that are considered traditional in Centerville, provide compatible
scale and mass to surrounding development, and to mitigate negative impacts. 
These regulations serve as a basis to promote creative architectural design
that is in context with its surroundings.
      2.   General Architectural Design Requirements
         a.   These general architectural design requirements of exterior
building elevations shall apply to all non-residential uses within any base
zoning district:
            i.   Architectural elevations for all buildings shall be that the
design, massing, materials, shape, and scale, of all new or modified principal
buildings, and accessory buildings shall create a unified design on the
premises and shall be visually compatible with the surrounding buildings.
            ii.   The Planning Commission must review and approve the
architectural design of all new non-residential buildings and additions to
existing buildings in accordance to the requirements of this ordinance.
            iii.   The Planning Commission shall adopt and maintain a Design
Guideline to provide additional information and clarification of the standards
contained in this Ordinance.
         b.   Building Design and Mass
            i.   All architectural elevations of principal buildings shall
consist of a base, a body, and a cap.
               1)   The base shall occupy the lowest portion of the elevation,
and shall have a height no less than 8% of the average wall height.
               2)   The body shall occupy the middle portion of the elevation,
and shall have a height no less than 60% of the average wall height. 
               3)   The cap shall occupy the highest portion of the elevation,
excluding the roof, and shall have a height no less than 8% of the average wall
height, not to exceed the height of the base.
               4)   The cap shall consist of at least one of the following
architectural features: a cornice, parapet, awning, canopy, or eaves.
               5)   The base and cap shall be clearly distinguishable from the
body through changes in color, material, pattern, profile, or texture. A cap
and base shall incorporate at least three of these design elements.
            ii.   Buildings that are characterized by a flat roof and a
continuous wall elevation of uniform height shall contain three-dimensional
architectural elements which serve to break up the horizontal emphasis of the
elevation. Building entrances, corners and other similar features are examples
that may be characterized by a separate mass.
               1)   These architectural elements shall present a balanced
design for the entire building.
               2)   For a single story building, required architectural
elements shall have a height that exceeds the wall height of the dominant
portion of the building by at least 10% but no greater than the maximum
building height required by the zoning district.
               3)   Architectural elements shall be distributed in a manner
that limits the length of a continuous wall section of uniform height to 100
feet.
         c.   Building Wall Materials

be permitted as base siding materials.
            ii.   Building Cap:  Brick, stone, textured concrete block, wood,
or applied materials such as exterior insulation finish system (E.I.F.S.), or
other synthetic materials are examples of materials permitted for the building
cap. Materials not specifically mentioned may also be permitted with the
specific approval of the Planning Commission.
            iii.   Building Body:  Wood, brick, and stone shall be permitted as
siding materials for the body of the building.  The following body materials
are considered inappropriate, however, may be permitted with the specific
approval by the Planning Commission on a case-by-case basis:
               1)   Siding that imitates wood lap siding such as aluminum or
vinyl siding or siding that imitates brick or stone,

   D.   Supplemental Standards for the Architectural Preservation District, APD
      1.   Purpose
      The City of Centerville, recognizing the unique panorama of architectural
history that has developed along the major cross-roads of our community, hereby
declares as a matter of public policy that the preservation, protection,
perpetuation, and use of areas, places, structures, works of art or similar
objects having a special historical, cultural, or aesthetic interest or value
is a public necessity, and is required in the interest of the health, safety,
convenience, comfort, prosperity, or general welfare of the citizens of
Centerville. The purpose of this section of the UDO is to:
         a.   Protect the historic and architecturally significant buildings
within the APD.
         b.   Insure architectural harmony between buildings of widely varying
architectural periods and styles.
         c.   Protect the existing residential uses within the APD.
         d.   Stabilize, improve, and protect the property values of businesses
within the APD.
         e.   Strengthen the economy of the City of Centerville.
         f.   Protect and enhance the visual and aesthetic character,
diversity, and interest in the City of Centerville.
         g.   Promote the use and preservation of historic sites and structures
for the education and general welfare of the citizens of the City of
Centerville.
         h.   Establish standards and criteria for the APD.
      2.   Development Standards
         a.   Demolition or Moving of Buildings
            i.   The demolition or moving of buildings within the APD shall
require the approval of the Board of Architectural Review (BAR); however, staff
may approve a demolition application where an extreme safety hazard exists. In
order to grant such approval, the BAR must be satisfied that the building meets
at least 1 of the following criteria.
               1)   Health and Safety Hazard. The building has been deemed to
be a hazard to public health or safety and repairs are deemed to be unfeasible
as determined by the Building Inspector or his designee.
               2)   Deterrent to Major Community Improvement. The building is a
deterrent to a major community improvement which the applicant must demonstrate
will be of substantial benefit to the community. This improvement must be shown
to have great potential for increasing surrounding property values.
               3)   Rehabilitation Not Economically Feasible. Rehabilitation of
the building is not economically feasible. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to prove that rehabilitation of the building would not allow a
reasonable economic return on the owner's investment.
               4)   Detriment to Community. The retention of the building would
not be in the interest of the community as a whole as is determined by the BAR.
            ii.   Demolition Delay Period.  In cases where approval for
demolition is granted, for reasons other than public health or safety, such
approval shall not become effective until 3 months after the date of the
approval decision by the BAR in order to provide a period of time within which
it may be possible to relieve a hardship or to cause the property to be
transferred to another owner who will retain the building. This in no way
implies approval by the Building Department whose approval must also be secured
in addition to the approval of the BAR. The BAR may waive any portion of the 3
month demolition delay period.
         b.   Off-Street Parking and Loading
            i.   All parking and loading areas shall be located in the rear
yard of all non-residential, multi-family, or mixed residential and non-
residential uses. Front yard or side yard parking for these uses shall be
prohibited; however, side yard parking for a corner lot shall be permitted.
            ii.   Side or front yard parking shall be permitted for single-
family and two-family residential uses.
            iii.   Refer to the Off-Street Parking and Loading, Section
9.29 of this Ordinance for additional requirements.
         c.   Sidewalks
            i.   All sidewalks located within dedicated public right-of-way or
public roadway easements in the APD shall be of red brick type surface. This
requirement shall be achieved in time through the installation of new brick
sidewalks and the replacement of existing non-brick sidewalks. 
         d.   Location of Building(s) on the Lot
            i.   Parallel or Perpendicular to the Street.  All building fronts
shall be located on the lot parallel or perpendicular to the front lot line.
            ii.   Front Yard Building Setback.  The dimension of the required
front yard of a lot shall be determined by computing the average building
setbacks for existing structures along the same block front.  The setback line
may be modified by the BAR to reflect historic patterns.  The BAR shall take
into consideration the setback of adjacent buildings, existing and proposed
easements, lot configuration, pubic right-of-way, thoroughfare improvements, or
applicable goals from Create the Vision.
            iii.   Additional building setback standards in Section
9.05, Table 9.00.
         e.   General Design Requirement for Exterior Building Architectural
Elevations
            The general design requirement for exterior building architectural
elevations shall be that the size, shape, location, materials, and architecture
of all new or modified principal buildings, accessory buildings, and garages
shall be visually compatible with the surrounding buildings. The more detailed
standards of this section of the UDO shall be used to determine the visual
compatibility of a building with the surrounding buildings.  The Design Review
Criteria shall be used to reference architectural styles that may be prevalent
in different areas of the Architectural Preservation District.  The BAR may
vary the architectural standards of Section
9.53, D. of the UDO to assure architectural and historic compatibility in
accordance with the Design Review Criteria.

following categories:
   1.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.   
   2.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.   
   3.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) means a formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
