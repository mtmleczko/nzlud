PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Wilmington, North Carolina, of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1962 Code, as supplemented through February 15, 2005, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1962 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
    "County Code references" in Part I refer to the special-acts portion of the New Hanover County Code. "County Code references" in Parts II and III refer to the ordinance portion of the New Hanover County Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-1 and the second section of Chapter 3 is 3-2. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 6-6 and 6-7 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 6-6.1, 6-6.2 and 6-6.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 4 and 5, it will be designated as Chapter 4.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this publication is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of an article of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the article. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are the parts of this volume at the time of publication and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CHARTER CHT:1 RELATED LAWS RL:1 CHARTER AND RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE CCT:1 STATUTORY REFEERENCE TABLE SRT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indices 
    The indices of the Code have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indices which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of John Dombroski, Vice-President of the Supplement Department, and Elizabeth A. Butler, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Thomas C. Pollard, City Attorney and Ms. Penelope Spicer-Sidbury, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

    A certificate of the city clerk under seal of the city, wherein the City of Wilmington shall be recited as the plaintiff and the name of the owner or owners of the premises recited as the defendants, together with a sufficiently definite recital of the premises to identify the same, and the amount of costs incurred in the making of the connections, and when the same was paid by the city, shall constitute a sufficient complaint in such an action. 
    And judgment shall be entered by the court condemning such property to sale and a date fixed for such sale. Notice of such sale shall be given by publication once a week for four (4) weeks in a daily newspaper published in the City of Wilmington and the first publication thereof shall be thirty (30) days prior to such sale.

Upon receipt of a sufficient application and petition signed by the majority of property owners owning the majority of the property abutting the public street or alley, requesting the closing, and after an investigation of the sufficiency of the application and petition by the city attorney or other designated individual or agency, and after a review and recommendation by the planning commission, the city council may adopt a resolution declaring the intent to close the public street or alley and calling a public hearing on the question. The resolution shall be: 
(1)  Published once a week for four (4) successive weeks prior to the hearing; 
(2)  A copy thereof shall be sent by registered or certified mail to all owners of property adjoining the street or alley as shown on the New Hanover County tax records; and, 
(3)  A notice of the closing and public hearing shall be prominently posted in at least two (2) places along the street or alley. 
    If the public streets or alleys are under the authority and control of the board of transportation, a copy of the resolution shall be mailed to the board of transportation. At the hearing, any person may be heard on the question of whether or not the closing would be detrimental to the public interest, or the property rights of any individual. If it appears to the satisfaction of the city council after the hearing that the closing is not contrary to the public interest, and that no individual owning property in the vicinity of the public street or alley or in the subdivision in which it is located would thereby be deprived of reasonable means of ingress and egress to his property, the city council may adopt an order closing the public street or alley. A certified copy of the order (or judgment of the court) shall be filed in the office of the register of deeds of New Hanover County. 
(b)  Any person aggrieved by the closing of any public street or alley may appeal the council's order to the general court of justice within thirty (30) days after its adoption. The court shall hear the matter de novo, and shall have full jurisdiction to try the issues arising and to order the public street or alley closed upon proper findings of fact by the jury. No cause of action or defense founded upon the invalidity of any proceedings taken in closing any public street or alley may be asserted, nor shall the validity of the order be open to question in any court upon any ground whatever, except in an action or proceeding begun within thirty (30) days after the order is adopted. 
(c)  Upon the closing of a public street or alley in accordance with this section, all right, title, and interest in the right-of-way shall be conclusively presumed to be vested in those persons owning lots or parcels of land adjacent to the public street or alley and the title of such adjoining landowners, for the width of the abutting land owned by them, shall extend to the centerline of the public street or alley. 
(d)  This [section] shall apply to any public street or alley that has been irrevocably dedicated to the public, without regard to whether it has actually been opened. 
(e)  The resolution ordering the closing of the public street or alley may provide for utility rights-of-way to be retained by the city or public utility company, if needed. 
(f)  No public street or alley under the control of the board of transportation may be closed unless the board of transportation consents thereto. 
(g)  A fee shall be paid to the city by the applicant upon and regardless of the final action by the city council, to cover the cost of advertising and other administrative expenses incurred for the closing of the public street or alley.

If any street under the provisions of such ordinance is to be widened, it need not be widened on both sides; and, if it is to be widened on both sides, the distance to be widened on both sides need not be the same. Any ordinance introduced for the purpose of widening, extending, or opening any street under the provisions of this charter, may not be adopted until the proposed ordinance is published in the newspaper published in the city and qualified to carry legal notices at least two (2) times, on separate days, at least ten (10) days before the passage of the ordinance, or, if there be no such newspaper, posted in three (3) public places in the city. There shall be posted or published with the ordinance a notice stating when property owners may be heard by the council. A public hearing on the question of the adoption of such ordinance shall be held prior to the passage of the ordinance. [The council] may refer the matter to the [Wilmington Planning Commission] for study and recommendations, but no public hearing shall be necessary before the planning commission. 
Sec. 17.2. - Notice to city prerequisite to improvement in proposed street lines. 
    After the passage of such ordinance, it shall be unlawful for any land within the proposed street lines established by such ordinance to be built upon or improved, or for any part of any existing building within such lines to be repaired or otherwise improved until the city shall have been given an opportunity to purchase or otherwise acquire such property for street purposes as provided in this charter. To that end, any person proposing to build upon such land or to make repairs or improvements to that part of any existing building situated thereon shall, in writing, notify the city council of the nature and estimated cost of such building, repairs, or improvements. The council shall then determine whether it will take the necessary steps to acquire such property prior to the construction of such building or the making of such repairs or improvements and if it fails from sixty (60) days from date of receipt of such notice to acquire, or to institute condemnation proceedings to acquire such property, the owner or other person giving such notice may proceed to erect the building in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the city, or to make the repairs or improvements described in such notice. 
Sec. 17.3. - Failure to give notice bars recovery for improvements. 
    If any person, firm, or corporation builds upon any land included within proposed street lines, or repairs or otherwise improves that part of any existing building within the proposed street lines without giving the city an opportunity to acquire such land free from such improvements, as provided in the preceding section, the city shall not be required to pay for the value of the building, repairs, or improvements in any proceedings subsequently brought to acquire such land for the purpose set out in the preceding section. 
Sec. 17.4. - Acquisition of land prior to improvement. 
    If upon receiving a notice in compliance with section 17.2 the city council determines to acquire such land immediately, it may acquire the same by grant, purchase, or condemnation. In no case shall an effort to purchase such land be necessary to the institution of condemnation proceedings. If the council determines to proceed by condemnation, the condemnation shall be as set forth in this charter. 
Editor's note- See footnote to "Article XVIII, Eminent Domain." 
Sec. 17.5. - Cost of land acquired to be assessed as part of improvements. 
    After any land has been purchased or condemned for the purpose of widening, extending, or opening any street, and land purchased or condemned lies within the limits of an improvement directed in such proceedings, then the amount paid by the city for the land purchased or condemned, together with the cost of the condemnation proceeding and interest on such amount paid and costs at the rate of six (6) per cent per annum from the date of payment, shall be included in the cost of such improvement and shall be assessed as provided by law against the property to be assessed for the improvements. 
State Law reference- Special assessments, G.S. § 160A-216 et seq. 
Sec. 17.6. - Exercise of condemnation power after failure of city to acquire following notice of improvement. 
    The failure of the city to acquire any land within sixty (60) [days] after receiving notice that the same is to be built upon, or that a building thereon is to be repaired or otherwise improved, or its failure within such time to institute proceedings to condemn same, shall not limit the right of the city at any subsequent time to condemn the same; but in such case the owner shall be entitled to compensation as now provided by law for the building, repairs, or improvements made after the giving of the required notice and the failure of the city to acquire such land free of such improvements.

Sec. 18.5. - Failure of owners to appoint appraisers. 
    If within fifteen (15) days after service of the resolution upon all of the owners, they, or a majority in interest of them, fail to appoint an appraiser and to report his name to the city clerk, the city council shall appoint a disinterested freeholder of the city to represent them. 
Sec. 18.6. - Appointment of third appraiser; oath of appraisers.

Each appraiser shall take an oath or affirmation that he will fairly and impartially discharge his duties as an appraiser. 
Sec. 18.7. - First meeting of appraisers. 
    At the time fixed by the resolution of condemnation, the appraisers shall meet on the premises to be condemned.

    Determining the compensation to be paid by the city for the land or easement condemned, the appraisers shall take into consideration both the loss or damage which will result to the owners from the condemnation of the land or easement and the benefits that will result to any remainder of such land from the improvement for which the land or easement is to be condemned, the benefits to include both benefits for advantages special to the land, and benefits or advantages to the land, in common with other lands affected by the improvement. The appraisers shall also take into consideration the value of any building or other property situated upon the land proposed to be condemned, if the owner is to be allowed to remove the building or other property, and the value thereof shall not be included in the compensation award. Having determined damages and benefits, the appraisers shall make their report to the city council, in which report the appraisers shall show separately the amount of damages, the amount of benefits, and the amount which shall be paid by the city if it finally condemns the land or easement. In the event the property condemned is subject to a recorded lease, or leases, the appraisers shall apportion the award between, or among, the person or persons owning fee or fees and the person or persons owning the sole interest or interests; but in no event shall the total of the amount so apportioned exceed the value of the property were it not subject to a recorded lease or leases.

Sec. 18.10. - Action of council on report of appraisers. 
    Within thirty (30) days after the report of the appraisers is submitted to the city council, the council shall determine what action it will take thereon. If the council determines to abandon the proposed condemnation, it shall adopt a resolution to that effect; but the abandonment of the condemnation shall not prevent the city council from thereafter instituting a proceeding to condemn the same land or easement. If the council determines to condemn the land or easement, it shall adopt a resolution which shall contain substantially the following: 
(1)  A recital that a board of appraisers has been appointed to determine the compensation to be paid for the land or easement, as provided by this charter, and that the appraisers have submitted a report to the council. 
(2)  A statement of the amount of damages and benefits as fixed by the appraisers and of the compensation to be paid by the city for the land or easement condemned as fixed by the appraisers. 
(3)  The determination of the council as to the condemnation of the land or easement. 
(4)  A description of the land condemned in fee, or of the easement condemned. 
(5)  A statement of the purpose for which the land or easement is condemned. 
(6)  The name of the owner or owners of the land and of other persons interested therein who were made parties to the proceeding. 
(7)  The determination of the council as to the time when the city will take possession of the land or easement condemned, and a direction that such premises shall be vacated by such time, and, in case the owner is allowed to remove any building or part thereof, or any other property on the premises, a direction that such property shall be removed before said date and that if the owner fails to remove the same within such time, the council will have the same removed and the cost thereof shall be a lien upon the remainder of the property. 
Sec. 18.11. - Vesting of title in city. 
    The adoption by the city council of a final resolution of condemnation, as provided in the preceding section shall have the effect of a judgment against the City of Wilmington for the amount of compensation fixed by the appraisers, and shall vest in the city title to the land or easement condemned. 
Sec. 18.12. - Appeal to superior court. 
    If upon the adoption by the city council of a final resolution of condemnation, either the owner of the land or easement condemned or the city council itself is dissatisfied with the amount of the compensation to be paid for such land or easement as fixed by the appraisers, such owner, or the city, or both may, within ten (10) days after the date of the adoption of such resolution, appeal to the superior court of New Hanover County. The party, or parties, appealing shall, within such ten (10) days, give notice of appeal to the other party by personal service if practicable and, if not, by publication of a notice one time in a newspaper published in the city, which is qualified to carry legal notices. The appeal, or appeals shall not interfere with the vesting in the city of title to the land or easement condemned or hinder the city in any way in proceeding with the improvements for which such land or easement was condemned, except that if the land or interest therein is owned by another public or quasi-public body, or by a railroad or public utility company, the vesting of title in the city shall not become effective until the court has rendered final judgment on the question of whether the condemnation by the city is in the public interest, and has determined the amount of compensation to be awarded for the condemnation, in which case the court may, in its discretion, reduce the amount of land, or interest therein, which it shall allow to be condemned. 
Sec. 18.13. - Record upon appeal. 
    Upon the appeal taken by either party, the city clerk shall certify a copy of the record in the condemnation proceeding to the superior court of New Hanover County, and such appeal shall be tried as other actions at law. The record upon appeal shall be composed of the preliminary resolution of condemnation, the oath of appraisers, the report of appraisals, the final resolution of condemnation, and the notice or notices of appeal. The record upon appeal or any part thereof, shall be competent as evidence upon the trial of an appeal. 
Sec. 18.14. - Condemnation before determination of compensation. 
    When, in the judgment of the city council, the public interest requires that the city enter into immediate possession of any land, it shall adopt a resolution stating such necessity, and the reason therefor, and condemning the required land or easement, and providing for the determination of the compensation to be paid by the city for the land or easement. The procedure therefor with respect to determination of such compensation shall follow as closely as practical the provisions of this article, or of the provisions of general law concerning eminent domain. This section shall not apply to land, or interest therein, owned by another public or quasi-public party, or railroad or public utility company. 
Sec. 18.15. - Registration of condemnation proceedings. 
    In any case where any land or easement therein has been, or may hereafter be condemned by the city council, a copy of so much of the condemnation proceedings as may be necessary to show the land or easement therein condemned and the condemnation thereof shall be certified by the city clerk and the same, upon being probated by the clerk of the superior court, or other person authorized by law to probate instruments for registration, shall be registered in the office of the register of deeds of New Hanover County. 
Sec. 18.16. - Sale or other disposition of land condemned. 
    When any land condemned in fee by the city is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was condemned, the same may be used by the city for any other public purpose, or may be sold or otherwise disposed of according to law. 
Sec. 18.17. - Removal by city of structures on condemned land; lien. 
    When any property upon which any building or other structure is wholly or partly located, is condemned by the city under the provisions of this charter, or any other law, and the owner is allowed to remove such building or structure, or part thereof, the city council may, after the report of the appraisers has been made, name the time within which the owner may remove the building or structure, or part thereof, and if the owner fails to remove the same within such time, the council may remove the same and the cost thereof shall be a lien upon the remainder of the land, or such cost may be recovered by the city in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
Sec. 18.18. - Procedure not exclusive. 
    The condemnation procedure set forth in this [article] shall not be exclusive, but shall be in addition to any other procedure provided by law. 
Sec. 18.19. - Procedure not applicable outside New Hanover County. 
    The condemnation procedure set forth in Article 2 of Chapter 40 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, and not the procedure set forth in this division, shall be applicable to the exercise of the power of eminent domain by the city for the condemnation of any land, right of access, right-of-way, water right, privilege, easement, or any other interest in or relating to land or water which is, or are, located outside of the geographic boundaries of New Hanover County.

A copy of the notice shall be served upon the owners of the lands subject to assessment for such improvements if such owners can be found with reasonable diligence within the city. If any such owner cannot with reasonable diligence be found within the city, then a copy of the notice shall be mailed to his address as nearly as the same can be ascertained with due diligence. The certificate of the person designated to serve or mail the notices that such notices were served or mailed shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. The serving or mailing of notices shall be completed not less than five (5) days prior to the date fixed for the hearing. The word "owners" as used herein has the same meaning as in section 19.5.

Any objections to the legality of the making of the improvements not made in writing, signed in person or by attorney and filed with the city clerk at or before the time or adjourned time of the hearing shall be considered as waived; and if any such objection shall be made and shall not be sustained by the council, the adoption of the resolution ordering the making of the improvements shall be final adjudication of the issues presented, unless within ten (10) days after the adoption of the resolution proper steps shall be taken in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief. 
Sec. 19.8. - Resolution ordering improvements; publication. 
(a)  After the public hearing, if the council determines to make the improvements proposed, it shall adopt a resolution which shall contain: 
(1)  If the improvements are to be made by petition, a finding by the council of such facts as are required in order to authorize improvements without petition. 
(2)  If the improvements are to be made without petition, a finding of the council of such facts as are required in order to authorize improvements without petition.

(5)  If the improvement directed to be made includes the construction of water mains or sewers, and in order to provide the mains or sewers in the street or streets to be improved it is necessary to extend them beyond the limits of the street or streets, the resolution shall contain a provision for the necessary extension of such mains and sewers and a further provision that the cost of such extension shall eventually be assessed against the lots or parcels of land abutting the street or streets in which such extensions are made but that assessments shall not be made until such time as the council shall thereafter determine by appropriate resolution.

The council shall have power also, unless otherwise limited, to determine the number of water and sewer laterals that shall be laid to any lot on any street to be improved. If the work, or any part thereof, is to be done by contract, the council may let all of the work in one contract, or it may divide it into several contracts, and may let contracts separately. 
(Sess. Laws 1981, Ch. 374, § 1(7)) 
Sec. 19.10. - Determination as to cost of improvements. 
    Upon completion of the improvements, the city council shall ascertain the total cost. In addition to other items of cost, there may be included therein the cost of all necessary legal services, the amount of interest paid during construction, the amount of damages paid or to be paid for injury to property by reason of any change of grade or drainage, including court costs and other expenses incidental to the determination of damages, and the cost of retaining walls, sidewalks or fences built or altered in lieu of cash payment for property damage, including the cost of moving or altering any building, and the cost of acquisition of right-of-way which is necessary for the improvement. The determination of the council as to the total cost of any improvement shall be conclusive. 
Sec. 19.11. - Preliminary assessment. 
(a)  Having determined the total cost, the council shall make a preliminary assessment. The preliminary assessment shall be advisory only and shall be subject to modification. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, the preliminary assessment shall be as follows: 
(1)  Roadway paving. No assessment shall be levied for the following costs: 
(A)  The cost incurred at public street or alley intersections. 
(B)  On streets abutting residential property, that cost of pavement in excess of thirty (30) feet in width, exclusive of curb and gutter, which cost shall be borne by the city. 
Fifty (50) per cent of the cost of any roadway paving improvement (excepting (A) and (B) above) shall be specially assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting the street containing the roadway paved, according to the frontages thereon, by an equal rate per foot of frontage, except that, where the petition so requested, the entire cost shall be assessed against the lands on one side of the street only, or against such lands as were designated in the petition. 
In lieu of the above stated rate of assessment of fifty (50) per cent of the cost, the council may designate a uniform cost per front foot to be assessed for pavements installed during a certain period of time. 
For the purpose of assessing for roadway pavement on a residential street, a thirty-foot wide street (exclusive of the width of curb and gutter) shall be deemed sufficient for ingress and egress to residential property. An assessment covering the cost of construction, reconstruction, or widening of a street abutting residential property shall not be greater than would have been necessary to provide this thirty-foot wide street. In computing the assessment, the property owner shall be charged with the cost of the curb and gutter plus the roadway construction costs for a thirty-foot wide pavement. This provision has no application to the assessment of the costs of sidewalks or driveways, the cost of which improvements are to be assessed entirely or partially to the abutting frontage, or to storm or sanitary sewers or water mains, which costs are to be assessed as provided under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section. 
(2)  Water mains and sewers. The cost of not exceeding an eight-inch water main, and an eight-inch sanitary sewer main, and not exceeding a thirty-inch storm sewer main shall be assessed against the abutting property. Assessments may be made on the basis of any of the methods set forth in G.S. 160A-218. If a water main in excess of eight (8) inches, a sanitary sewer main in excess of eight (8) inches in size, or a storm sewer in excess of thirty (30) inches in size is laid, the excess cost shall be borne by the city. If the resolution ordered the construction of any pumping station, outfall, septic tank or disposal plant, no part of the cost of the same shall be specially assessed. Nothing contained herein shall be constructed to limit the power of the council to contract with any property owner or owners for the construction of any pumping station, outfall, septic tank or disposal plant or for the construction of water mains or storm or sanitary sewers and for the assessment of the cost thereof according to the terms of such contract. The entire cost of each water and sewer lateral shall be specially charged against the particular lot or parcel of land for or in connection with which it was constructed, except that assessments shall be calculated as if the lateral were laid from the center of the street. The cost of installing storm sewers may, however, be assessed as part of the cost of roadway paving. 
(3)  Sidewalks. The total cost of constructing or reconstructing sidewalks shall be assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting that side of the street upon which the improvement is made according to their respective frontages thereon by an equal rate per foot of such frontage, the lots within a block being deemed to abut upon a sidewalk although the latter extends beyond the lot to the curb line of an intersecting street. The total cost of constructing portion of driveways within the street area shall be assessed against the lots for which they are constructed. 
(4)  Grass plots. The entire cost of grading or otherwise improving or of planing the grass plots in any street or part thereof shall be assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting the street or part thereof where or whereon the improvements are made by an equal rate per front foot of such frontage; provided, that this subsection shall be construed to mean that when a grass plot in any street is graded or planted or otherwise improved, the cost thereof shall be assessed against all of the property abutting the street within the block where such grass plot is located. 
(b)  If the petition (or the resolution in those cases where the improvement was ordered made without petition) specified that there should be specially assessed against the abutting property a smaller portion of the cost of any improvement than that set forth in paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section, there shall be assessed against the abutting property only a proportion of the cost as was specified in the petition or in such resolution. No restriction or denial of access to an abutting street shall affect the levy or collection of any assessment for local improvements. 
(c)  The cost of paving, water, sewer, and sidewalk improvements upon, in, or to any portion of a right-of-way or any property owned by the State of North Carolina, any agency or subdivision thereof, shall be assessed against the right-of-way or property and shall be paid by the state, its agency or subdivision. 
(Sess. Laws 1981, Ch. 374, § 1(8)) 
Sec. 19.12. - Corner lot exemptions. 
    The council shall have authority to determine the amount and applicability of assessment exemptions for corner lots, and to distinguish between different classifications of property uses. The schedule of exemptions shall not exceed the maximum limitations set forth in G.S. 160A-219. If the corner formed by two (2) intersecting streets is rounded into a curve or is foreshortened for the purpose of providing sight distance or for any other purpose of construction, the frontage for assessment purposes shall be calculated to the midpoint of the curve or foreshortened corner. 
(Sess. Laws 1981, Ch. 374, § 1(9)) 
Sec. 19.13. - Preliminary assessment roll. 
    The city council shall cause to be prepared a preliminary assessment roll, on which shall be entered a brief description of each lot, the name or names of the owner or owners of each lot, as far as the same can be ascertained; provided, that a map of the improvements on which is shown the location of each affected lot, together with the amount assessed against each lot and the name or names of the owner or owners thereof, as far as the same can be ascertained, shall be a sufficient assessment roll. If the resolution directed the making of more than one improvement, a single preliminary assessment roll for all the improvements authorized by such resolution shall be sufficient but the cost of each improvement to each lot affected shall be shown separately. After the preliminary assessment roll has been completed, it shall be filed in the office of the city clerk, and there shall be published in some newspaper, published in the city, which is qualified to carry legal notices, or if there be no such newspaper, the city clerk shall cause to be posted in three (3) public places in the city, a notice of the completion of the assessment roll, setting forth a description in general terms of the improvements, the amount of each assessment, and stating the time fixed for the meeting of the city council for the hearing of objections to the special assessments, such meeting to be not earlier than ten (10) days after the first publication, or from the date of posting of such notice. Any number of assessment rolls may be included in one notice. In any case where the preliminary notice was served or mailed, instead of being published, this notice need not be published or posted, but may be served or mailed. The serving or mailing of notices shall be completed not less than five (5) days prior to the date fixed for the hearing of the assessment roll, and the return of the person serving or mailing the same shall, in the absence of fraud, be conclusive that the same was served or mailed. 
(Sess. Laws 1981, Ch. 374, § 1(10)) 
Sec. 19.14. - Hearing, revision and confirmation of preliminary assessment roll; lien. 
    At the time appointed for that purpose, or at some other time to which it may adjourn, the city council shall hear objections to the preliminary assessment roll of all persons interested who may appear and offer proof in relation thereto. Then, or thereafter, the council shall either annul or sustain or modify in whole, or in part, the assessment, either by confirming the preliminary assessment against any or all lots or parcels described thereon or by cancelling, increasing or reducing the same, according to the special benefits which the council decides each of the lots or parcels has received or will receive on account of the improvements, except that assessments against a railroad or railroads, because of contract or franchise obligations shall be in accordance with such obligations. If any property is omitted from the preliminary roll, the council may place it on the roll and levy proper assessment. The council may thereupon confirm the assessment roll, and the assessment so confirmed shall be in proportion to the special benefits, except in the case of franchise obligations to railroads. Whenever the city council shall confirm assessments for local purposes, the city clerk shall enter on the council minutes and on the assessment roll the date, hour, and minute of confirmation. The assessment shall be a lien on the property assessed, of the same nature and to the same extent as county and city taxes, and shall be superior to all other liens and encumbrances. After the assessment roll is confirmed, a copy of the same shall be delivered to the [city tax collector]. 
Sec. 19.15. - Appeal to superior court. 
    If the owner of, or any person interested in, any lot or parcel of land against which an assessment is made is dissatisfied with the amount of the assessment, he may, within ten (10) days after the confirmation of the assessment roll, give written notice to the city council that he takes an appeal to the superior court of New Hanover County, in which case he shall, within twenty (20) days after the confirmation of the assessment roll, serve on the mayor or city clerk a statement of facts upon which he bases his appeal. The appeal shall be tried as other actions at law. The remedy herein provided for any person dissatisfied with the amount of the assessment against any property of which he is the owner, or in which he is interested, shall be exclusive.

Sec. 19.16. - Power to correct error in assessment. 
    It shall appear, after confirmation of any assessment roll, that an error has been made, the city clerk shall cause to be published one time in some newspaper published in the city, or if there be no such newspaper, the city clerk shall cause to be posted at three (3) public places in the city, a notice referring to the assessment roll in which error was made, naming the owner or owners of the lot or parcel of land affected by the error, if the same can be ascertained and naming the time and place fixed for a hearing by the council for the correction of the error, such meeting not to be earlier than ten (10) days from the publication or from the date of the posting of the notice. At the time fixed in the notice or at some subsequent time to which the council may adjourn, the council, after giving the owner or owners of the property affected, and other persons interested therein, an opportunity to be heard, may proceed to correct the error, and the assessment then made shall have the same force and effect as if it had originally been properly made. No notice and hearing shall be necessary if the correction does not increase an assessment against any property not owned by the city, or if all of the property owners affected by the correction waive notice in writing. 
Sec. 19.17. - Reassessment. 
    The city council shall have the power, when in its judgment there is any irregularity, omission, error or lack of jurisdiction in any of the proceedings relating thereto, to set aside the whole of the local assessment made by it, and thereupon make a reassessment. In such case there shall be included, as part of the cost of the improvements involved, all interest paid, or accrued on notes or certificates of indebtedness, or bonds issued by the city to pay the expenses of such improvement. The proceedings shall, as far as practical, be in all respects as in the case of original assessments, and the reassessment shall have the same force as if it had originally been properly made. 
Sec. 19.18. - Publication of notice of confirmation of assessment roll. 
    After the expiration of twenty (20) days from the confirmation of assessment roll, the city clerk shall cause to be published one time in some newspaper published in the city, which is qualified to carry legal notices, or, if there be no such newspaper, shall cause to be posted in at least three (3) public places therein a notice that any assessment contained in the assessment roll may be paid at any time before the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date of publication or posting of notice, without interest from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll, but that if such assessment is not paid in full within said time, all installments thereof shall bear interest at the rate to be established by the city council not to exceed the legal rate authorized by the General Statutes of North Carolina, from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll. 
State Law reference- Legal rate of interest, G.S. § 24-1. 
Sec. 19.19. - Payment of assessments in cash or by installments. 
    The property owner or railroad company assessed shall have the option of paying for improvements in cash or in not less than two (2) or more than ten (10) equal annual installments, as may be determined in the resolution ordering improvements. If paid in installments, installments shall bear interest at the rate to be established by the city council not to exceed the legal rate authorized by the General Statutes of North Carolina, from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll. If any assessment is not paid in cash, the first installment, with interest, shall become due and payable sixty (60) days after the date that the assessment roll is confirmed, and one subsequent installment and interest shall be due and payable on the same day of the same month in each successive year until the assessment is paid in full; provided, however, that if the city council shall so direct, installments shall become due and payable on the same date when property taxes of the city are due and payable. If any installment with interest is not paid when due, it shall be subject to the same penalties as are now prescribed by law for unpaid taxes, in addition to the interest herein provided for. The whole assessment may be paid at any time by the payment of the full amount due with accrued interest.

Sec. 19.20. - Enforcement of payment of assessments. 
    Upon the failure of any property owner to pay any installment when due and payable, all of the installments remaining unpaid shall immediately become due and payable, and property and rights-of-way may be sold by the city under the same rules, regulations, rights of redemption and savings as are now prescribed by law for the sale of land for unpaid taxes. Unpaid assessments, interest, and penalties owned by railroad companies and the State of North Carolina, its agencies or subdivisions, may be collected by writs of mandamus issued by the superior court of New Hanover County. Collection of assessments with interest and penalties may also be made by the city of [sic] proceedings to foreclose the lien of assessments as a lien for mortgages is, or may be, foreclosed under the laws of the state, and it shall be lawful to join in any bill for foreclosure any one or more lots or parcels of land, by whomsoever owned, if assessed for an improvement ordered by the same resolution, after default in payment of any installment. The payment of such installment, together with interest and penalties due thereon, before the lot or parcel of land, against which the same is a lien, is sold, or such lien is foreclosed, shall bar the right of the city to sell the land or to foreclose the lien by reason of default.

Sec. 19.21. - Assessment of cost of water mains and sewer extensions. 
    If the resolution ordering the making of any improvement, or improvements, included a provision for any necessary extension of a water main or sewer or sewers beyond the limit of a street, or streets, at such time after the completion of such extension, or extensions, as, in the judgment of the city council, circumstances justify the assessment of the cost thereof, the council shall cause a preliminary assessment to be made and the procedure thereafter to be followed with respect to such assessment, and the force and effect thereof shall be as already prescribed for other assessments. 
Sec. 19.22. - Apportionment of assessments. 
    In any case where one or more special assessments have been made, and property has been, or is about to be subdivided, and it is desirable that the assessments be apportioned among the subdivisions of such property, the city council may, upon application by the owner or owners, apportion the assessments among the subdivisions. Thereafter, each subdivision shall be relieved of any part of the original assessment except the part apportioned to the subdivision, and the part of the original assessment apportioned to any subdivision shall be of the same force and effect as the original assessment. 
Sec. 19.23. - Effect of change of ownership on proceedings. 
    No change of ownership of any property or interest therein after the passage of a resolution ordering the making of a local improvement shall affect subsequent proceedings, and the improvement may be completed and assessments made therefor as if there had been no change in ownership. 
Sec. 19.24. - Proceedings in rem. 
    All proceedings for special assessments shall be proceedings in rem and no mistake or omission as to the name of any owner or persons interested in the lot or parcel of land affected thereby shall be regarded as a substantial mistake or omission. 
Sec. 19.25. - Council may hold in abeyance certain water and sewer assessments. 
(a)  The city council may provide by resolution that assessments levied against abutting lots or parcels of land for water main improvements, or sanitary sewer improvements, when in its opinion such improvements may not presently be used by the owner or owners of the abutting lots or parcels of land, may be held in abeyance without the payment of any interest thereon until such time as the council shall determine that any such assessment shall be paid in accordance with the terms set out in the confirming resolution. A part of the assessments, levied for the improvements herein set out on a street or streets, or portion thereof, may be held in abeyance as herein provided without holding of all such assessments in abeyance. 
(b)  All statutes of limitations, and particularly the statute of limitations provided for in section 160A-233 of the General Statutes of the state are hereby suspended during the time that any assessment is held in abeyance without the payment of interest as provided in subsection (a) of this section. Such time shall not be a part of the time limited for the commencement of action for the enforcement of the payment of any such assessment, and such action may be brought at any time within ten (10) years from the date of the adoption of a resolution by the council, determining that such assessment shall be paid in accordance with the original resolution confirming it. 
(c)  Nothing herein shall be construed to revive any right of action [that has] heretofore been barred by the statute of limitations. 
(Sess. Laws 1981, Ch. 374, § 1(11)) 
Sec. 19.26. - [Assessment of abutting property outside the city.] 
    If any lots or parcels of land abutting any local improvements are located outside the city limits, the city council may continue and delay the levy of assessments against such property until the city limits are extended to include such property, or the council may provide that no water or sewer service connections shall be made to such property, pending the annexation thereof, until all assessments thereon are paid. Upon annexation, if not paid prior thereto, the council may levy assessments for such local improvements against such property, and the procedure therefor shall be the same as provided in this charter. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit or restrict the city council and a property owner from entering into an agreement for payments in lieu of assessments. 
Sec. 19.27. - Procedure for street improvement and assessment of property abutting but located outside the city limits. 
    In cases where the city limit line of the City of Wilmington runs along a street or road so that property on one side of the street or road lies within the corporate limits of the city, and the property on the other side of the street or road lies outside of such corporate limits, and a majority of all such property owners, owning a majority of the property abutting such street or road present a petition meeting the requirements of Article 10 [subsection 160A-216 et seq.], Chapter 160A, of the General Statutes of North Carolina, requesting the improvement of such street or road, the city council may approve such petition, make the improvements requested, and assess the cost thereof against the property abutting both sides of such street or road in like manner, and to the same extent that it would be authorized to do if such street or road, and the property abutting thereon lay wholly within the corporate limits of the city. 
Sec. 19.28. - Intervals of at least ten years for permanent street improvements of particular property. 
    Where permanent street improvements are made, the property bearing such assessments shall not be assessed for permanent street improvement again until after the expiration of ten (10) years from a date of the last preceding assessment. 
Sec. 19.29. - Special procedure with regard to sidewalk and driveway repairs. 
(1)  It shall be the duty of every property owner in the City of Wilmington to maintain the sidewalks and driveways abutting his property in good repair and in safe condition. 
(2)  The entire cost of the repair or reconstruction of sidewalks and driveways shall be paid by the abutting property owner. 
(3)  When a sidewalk or driveway is found to be in poor repair and of unsafe condition, the city manager, through the city engineer, shall notify the abutting owner thereof, and in such notice direct the owner to make the repair specified in the notice within thirty (30) days after such notice has been personally served upon or sent by certified mail to such owner at his last known address, or published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Wilmington if the owner's address is unknown. The owner, upon the receipt of such notice, may appeal to the city council from the direction of the city manager, or his agent; provided, that such appeal is taken within the thirty-day period during which the repair is required to be made; and in event of appeal, no repair of the property shall be required until the city council has heard and acted upon the appeal. If the property owner shall fail to appeal to the city council or fail to make the required improvement within the time set out in the notice, the city manager shall report such fact to the city council, and the city council may, by resolution[,] require the repair to be made and the cost thereof assessed against the abutting property, and such assessment shall constitute a lien upon the property superior to all other liens. Appeals to the superior court may be taken by any interested property owner within thirty (30) days after the adoption of the resolution, but if no appeal is taken, the action of the city council shall be conclusive of the necessity of such repair. 
    In such event, the cost of such improvement shall become a lien upon the particular abutting property and may thereafter be collected either by suit in the name of the city or by foreclosure of the lien in the same manner and subject to the same rules, regulations, costs and penalties as provided by G.S. 160A-233. 
(Sess. Laws 1981, Ch. 374, § 1(12), (13)) 
Sec. 19.30. - Grass plot and driveway maintenance. 
    It shall be the responsibility of the abutting property owner to maintain any grass plot or driveway between the property line and the curb of a paved street.

    In addition to all other power and authority granted to the city council of the City of Wilmington elsewhere in this charter, the city council is hereby authorized to adopt and enforce outside the corporate limits and within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city such building, plumbing, heating, or electrical regulations as the council is now or may hereafter be authorized to adopt within the city.

Sec. 23.6. - Zoning. 
(a)  In addition to other types of zoning districts permitted by G.S. 160A-382, the City Council may provide for the establishment of conditional zoning districts, including parallel conditional zoning districts. For purposes of this act, a "conditional zoning district" shall be defined as a zoning district in which the development and use of the property included in the district is subject to predetermined ordinance standards and the rules, regulations, and conditions imposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to the particular property. "Parallel conditional zoning district" shall mean a conditional zoning district in which the potential permitted use or uses are, except as limited by the conditions imposed on the district, of the same character or type as the use or uses permitted in a general use district having a parallel designation or name. In contrast to conditional use district or special use district zoning, conditional zoning shall not require the issuance of a conditional use or special use permit or permitting process apart from the establishment of the district and its application to particular properties. Rules, regulations, and conditions applicable to any conditional zoning district need not be uniform in all respects for all properties within the same classification of conditional zoning district but may differ based on the unique aspects of each conditional zoning district development, site, and surrounding area. 
(b)  Property may be rezoned to a conditional zoning district only in response to and consistent with a petition of the owners of all of the property to be included in the district. A petition for conditional zoning must include a site plan and supporting information that specifies the actual use or uses intended for the property and any rules, regulations, and conditions that, in addition to all predetermined ordinance requirements, will govern the development and use of the property. If a petition for conditional zoning is approved, the development and use of the property shall be governed by the predetermined ordinance requirements applicable to such district category, the approved site plan for the district, and any additional approved rules, regulations, and conditions, all of which shall constitute the zoning regulations for the approved district. 
(c)  Conditional zoning decisions shall be made in consideration of identified relevant adopted land-use plans for the area including, but not limited to, comprehensive plans, strategic plans, district plans, area plans, neighborhood plans, corridor plans, and other land-use policy documents. 
(d)  Before a public hearing may be held on a petition for conditional zoning, the petitioner must file in the Office of the City Clerk a written report of at least one community meeting held by the petitioner. Notice of such a meeting shall be given to the property owners and organizations entitled to notice as determined by city policy. The report shall include, among other things, a listing of those persons and organizations contacted about the meeting and the manner and date of contact; the date, time, and location of the meeting; a roster of the persons in attendance at the meeting; a summary of issues discussed at the meeting; and a description of any changes to the rezoning petition made by the petitioner as a result of the meeting. In the event the petitioner has not held at least one meeting pursuant to this subsection, the petitioner shall file a report documenting efforts that were made to arrange such a meeting and stating the reasons such a meeting was not held. The adequacy of a meeting held or report filed pursuant to this subsection shall be considered by the City Council but shall not be subject to judicial review. 
(e)  Conditional zoning decisions under this act are a legislative process subject to judicial review using the same procedures and standard of review as apply to general use district zoning decisions. 
(f)  Except as specifically modified by this act, the procedures to be followed by the City Council in reviewing, granting, or denying any petition for conditional zoning shall be the same as those established for general use district zoning petitions under Article 19 of Chapter 160A of the General Statutes. 
(g)  The City Council may not vote to rezone property to a conditional zoning district during the time period beginning on the date of a municipal general election and concluding on the date immediately following the date on which the City Council holds its organizational meeting following a municipal general election unless no person spoke against the rezoning at the public hearing and no valid protest petition under G.S. 160A-386 was filed.

State Law reference- Zoning, G.S. § 160A-381 et seq. 
Sec. 23.7. - Payments in lieu of dedication or reservation of property for recreation purposes or in lieu of actual construction or installation of required community service facilities. 
(a)  In adopting any subdivision control ordinance pursuant to provisions of this charter or G.S. 160A-372, the city council is authorized to provide for the dedication or reservation of recreation areas serving residents of the immediate neighborhood within the subdivision, or to provide for the payment in lieu thereof of such sum of money as the council may determine to be the equivalent in value of any such recreation area. 
(b)  In addition to any of the foregoing powers, the city council may, in adopting any subdivision control ordinance, allow a subdivider to pay funds to the city in lieu of the actual installation or construction of required community service facilities. Such facilities may include, without limitation, streets, public utility lines, drainage systems, and other property (real or personal) or improvements proposed or intended to eventually be dedicated to one or more public purposes where it is in the best public interest to delay or otherwise defer their actual installation or completion until a later date and it will not cause undue hardship upon either the residents of the proposed development or the surrounding neighborhood to postpone their actual construction or installation until some future date, which may or may not be specified, or to even subsequently abandon such improvements altogether whenever appropriate and for good cause. Under no circumstances, however, shall a developer be allowed to avoid installing required improvements or community facilities which are found by the approving bodies to be essential at the time the subdivision is approved. 
(c)  The city council may use any monies received in lieu of dedicated recreation areas for acquiring recreation areas beyond the boundaries of the immediate subdivision but within the neighborhood wherein the subdivision lies. [The] city council may also use funds received in lieu of required improvements for the original intended purpose or for any other lawful public purpose, whether or not such funds are used exclusively, in part or in whole, to serve, improve, enhance or otherwise benefit the approved subdivision, it being the express intent of this section to allow such monies to be used to serve the neighborhood or immediate area in which the subdivision lies and not necessarily restrict the use of such funds to use totally within the subdivision itself so long as the use serves some legitimate public purpose in the surrounding community. 
(Sess. Laws 1981, Ch. 375, § 1) 
Sec. 23.8. - Certificates of appropriateness in an area designated as an historic district overlay. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of G.S. 160A-397, the city council of the City of Wilmington may by ordinance require the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for exterior changes visible only from public rights-of-way, excluding alleys, within historic districts which overlay other zoning districts. For purposes of this section, an exterior change may include one or more of the items defined in G.S. 160A-397 as "exterior features." 
(Sess. Laws 1983, Ch. 432, § 1) 
Sec. 23.9. - Judicial review of decisions granting or denying approval of subdivision plats. 
    A final decision granting or denying approval of a subdivision plat by the city council or designated planning agency, whichever has final approval authority under an ordinance regulating the subdivision of land within the city's territorial jurisdiction, shall be subject to review by the superior court of New Hanover County by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. A petitioner seeking review must file a petition in the superior court of New Hanover County within thirty (30) days of the final decision of the city council or planning agency. Failure to file such a petition within thirty (30) days of such final decision shall bar review by the superior court. The final decision of the city council or planning agency shall not be stayed pending review except by order granted by the superior court.

(Sess. Laws 1991, Ch. 121, § 1) 
Sec. 23.11. - Low and moderate income housing; density bonuses. 
(a)  The city council may provide for the granting of density bonuses in one or more zoning districts in which residential uses are permitted, or provide other incentives of value to a developer of housing within the City and its extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction, if any, if the developer agrees to construct at least fifteen percent (15%) of the total housing units within the development for persons and families of low and moderate income. The size of the density bonus may vary with the percentage of housing units constructed within the development for persons or families of low or moderate income. 
(b)  The city council may provide for the enforcement of a developer's commitment to provide low and moderate income housing by ordinance or through the adoption of rules and regulations. Such ordinance or rules and regulations may require the developer to record restrictive covenants applicable to the property, to convey real estate interests in the property, to enter into binding contracts satisfactory to the city or to take other lawful action prescribed by the city. The city may prescribe the period of time during which the developer's commitment shall be binding. 
(c)  When used in this section, the following terms have the meanings indicated: 
(1)  "Density bonus" means an increase in the number of housing units allowed on the tract of land upon which the development is located, when compared to the maximum number of housing units which would be allowed on the tract of land in the absence of the density bonus. 
(2)  "Low and moderate income" has the meaning prescribed by the regulations of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development applicable to the City of Wilmington. In the absence of such regulations, the term "low and moderate income" shall have the meaning prescribed by the City Council by ordinance or resolution. The term "low and moderate" shall also be construed to mean low or moderate income.

(a)  The city council may require as part of its zoning regulations that a site plan be prepared, submitted, and approved prior to the issuance of any building permit for new construction, excluding renovation and repair of existing structures, and excluding accessory uses and their structures, unless the renovations and repairs and accessory uses shall cause an increase in the off-street parking requirement or a change in occupancy as occupancy is defined by the North Carolina State Building Code. Such ordinance shall specify the elements to be included in site plans submitted for approval in accordance with standards of the applicable ordinances; such elements may include, where appropriate, those relating to off-street parking, driveway access, internal circulation, screening, signs, landscaping, architectural features, locations and dimensions, topography and grading, utilities, drainage structures, open space and recreation areas, street and sidewalk improvements, loading and service areas, fire hydrants, and such other elements as may reasonably be related to the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. Where appropriate approval of site plans may be conditioned to include requirements that street and utility rights-of-way and recreational space be dedicated to or reserved for the public, or street, utility, or other improvements be made to the same extent as required by local subdivision regulations. The regulations may also provide for the payment in lieu of the dedication of property and rights-of-way or construction of improvements to the same extent as required by local land use regulations. This provision shall not apply to site plans for individual detached, single-and two-family units to be constructed on previously subdivided lots. This provision shall not apply to additions of less than five percent (5%) of gross floor area on an annual basis unless such addition causes an increase in the off-street parking requirement or a change in occupancy as occupancy is defined by the North Carolina State Building Code. 
(b)  The city council shall prescribe procedures for review and approval of site plans to ensure that development of property shall conform to applicable zoning or other revelant [relevant] laws or regulations, with approvals by designated city staff. Appeal shall lie from the staff to the board of adjustment or the city council. The city council may require that site plans be in conformity with previously approved subdivision plans or conditional use permits for the same property. In the event of a conflict between a requirement for site plan approval and requirements for previously approved subdivision plans or special or conditional use permits, the latter shall control. 
(Sess. Laws 1993, Ch. 318, § 1) 
Sec. 23.13. - Unified land use ordinance authorized.

ARTICLE XXXI. - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS 

Sec. 31.1. - Economic development projects. 
(a)  Definition. In this article, "economic development project" means an economic capital development project within a certain defined area or areas of the city as established by the city council, comprised of one or more buildings or other improvements, and including any public and/or private facilities. Said project may include programs or facilities for improving downtown redevelopment, "pocket of poverty," or other federal or state assistance programs which the city council determines to be in need of economic capital development or revitalization and which qualify for capital assistance under applicable federal or state programs. 
(b)  Authorization. 
(1)  In addition to any other authority granted by law, the City of Wilmington may accept grants, expend funds, make grants or loans, acquire property and participate in capital economic development projects which the city council determines will enhance the economic development and revitalization of the city in accordance with the authority granted herein. Such project may include both public and/or private buildings or facilities financed in whole or in part by federal or state grants (including but not limited to urban development action grants), and may include any capital expenditures which the city council finds necessary to comply with conditions in any federal or state grant agreements and which the city council finds will complement the project and improve the public tax base and general economy of the city. By way of illustration, but not limitation, such a project may include the construction or renovation of any one or combination of the following projects: 
a.  Privately owned hotel; 
b.  Privately owned office building; 
c.  Housing; 
d.  Parking facilities; 
e.  Industrial buildings; 
f.  Site improvements. 
Such project may be partially financed with city funds received from federal or state sources and being granted or loaned to the private owner for said construction or [renovation]; in addition, other city funds from any sources may be used for acquisition, construction, leasing and/or operation of facilities by the city for the general public and for capital improvements to public facilities which will support and enhance the private facilities and the general economy of the city. 
(2)  When the city council finds that it will promote the economic development or revitalization in the city, the city may acquire, construct and operate, or participate in the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of an economic development project or of specific buildings or facilities within such a project and may comply with any state or federal government grant requirements in connection therewith. The city may enter into binding contracts with one or more private parties or governmental units with respect to acquiring, constructing, owning or operating such a project. Such a contract may, among other provisions, specify the responsibilities of the city and the developer or developers and operators or owners of the project, including the financing of the project. Such a contract may be entered into before the acquisition of any real property necessary to the project by the city or the developer or other parties. 
(c)  Property acquisition. An economic development project may be constructed on property acquired by the developer or developers, or on property directly acquired by the city, or on property acquired by the redevelopment commission or its successors while exercising the powers, duties and responsibilities pursuant to G.S. 160A-505. 
(d)  Property disposition. In connection with an economic development project, the city may convey interests in property owned by it, including air rights over public facilities, as follows: 
(1)  If the property was acquired under the urban redevelopment law, the property interests may be conveyed in accordance with special or general law. 
(2)  If the property was acquired by the city directly, the city may convey property interests by any procedure set forth in its city charter, special act or the general law or by private negotiation or sale. 
(e)  Construction of the project. A contract between the city and the developer or developers may provide that the developer or developers shall be responsible for the construction of the entire economic development project. If so, the contract shall include such provisions as the city council deems sufficient to assure that any public facilities included in the project meet the needs of the city and are constructed at a reasonable price. Any funds loaned by the city, pursuant to this paragraph, to a private developer, and used by said developer in the construction of a project on private property shall not be deemed an expenditure of public funds. 
(f)  Operation. The city may contract for the operation of any public facility or facilities included in an economic development project by a person, partnership, firm or corporation, public or private. In addition, the city, upon consideration, may contract through lease or otherwise whereby it may operate privately constructed parking facilities to serve the general public. Such a contract shall include provisions sufficient to assure that any such facility or facilities are operated for the benefit of the citizens of the city.

Notwithstanding the provisions of G.S. 20-176, in the event that a municipality adopts an ordinance pursuant to this section, a violation of G.S. 20-158 at a location at which a traffic control photographic system is in operation shall not be an infraction. An ordinance authorized by this subsection shall provide that: 
(1)  The owner of a vehicle shall be responsible for a violation unless the owner can furnish evidence that the vehicle was, at the time of the violation, in the care, custody, or control of another person. The owner of the vehicle shall not be responsible for the violation if the owner of the vehicle, within 30 days after notification of the violation, furnishes the officials or agents of the municipality which issued the citation either of the following: 
(a)  An affidavit stating the name and address of the person or company who leased, rented, or otherwise had the care, custody, and control of the vehicle. 
(b)  An affidavit stating that the vehicle involved was, at the time, stolen. The affidavit must be supported with evidence that supports the affidavit, including insurance or police report information.

The citation shall be processed by officials or agents of the municipality and shall be forwarded by personal service or first-class mail to the address given on the motor vehicle registration. If the owner fails to pay the civil penalty or to respond to the citation within the time period specified on the citation, the owner shall have waived the right to contest responsibility for the violation, and shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00). The municipality may establish procedures for the collection of these penalties and may enforce the penalties by civil action in the nature of debt. 
(5)  The municipality shall institute a nonjudicial administrative hearing to review objections to citations or penalties issued or assessed under this section. 
(c1)  The duration of the yellow light change interval at intersections where traffic control photographic systems are in use shall be no less than the yellow light change interval duration specified in the Design Manual developed by the signals and Geometrics Section of the North Carolina Department of Transportation.

The combined tax and registration notice shall contain all county and municipal corporation taxes and fees due on the motor vehicle as computed by the assessor in the county of registration.

This procedure shall constitute the listing and assessment of each classified motor vehicle for taxation. The combined tax and registration notice shall contain: 
(1)  The date of the combined tax and registration notice.

(3)  The tax rate of the taxing units. 
(4)  A statement that the appraised value of the motor vehicle may be appealed to the assessor before the taxes and fees become delinquent.

(b)  When the combined tax and registration notice required by subsection (a) is prepared, the Property Tax Division of the Department of Revenue or a third-party contractor shall mail a copy of the notice, with appropriate instructions for payment, to the motor vehicle owner. The Department shall establish a fee equal to the actual cost of printing and sending the notice. The Department may receive a fee for each notice generated for a vehicle registered in a county or municipal corporation from the taxes and fees remitted to the county or municipal corporation in which the vehicle is registered. The collecting authority is responsible for collecting county and municipal taxes and fees assessed under this article and may retain a fee for collecting these taxes and fees. The fee retained by the collecting authority shall be an amount equal to at least one-third of the compensation paid for registration renewals conducted by contract agents under G.S. 20-63(h). The Property Tax Division shall establish procedures to ensure that tax payments and fees received pursuant to this article and Chapter 20 of the General Statutes are properly accounted for and taxes and fees due other taxing units and the Division of Motor Vehicles are remitted at least once each month.

(d)  The county shall include taxes on classified motor vehicles listed pursuant to G.S. 105-330.3(a)(1) in the tax levy for the fiscal year in which the taxes become due and shall charge the taxes to the tax collector for that year, unless the tax notice required by subsection (a) is prepared after the date the taxes are due.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 2-36. - Contract execution. 
(a)  All contracts for the construction, repair work, or purchase of apparatus, supplies, materials, or equipment requiring the estimated expenditure of public money in an amount equal to or more than the limit set forth in G.S. § 143-129 shall be awarded by the city council using the formal bid procedure, or shall otherwise be in compliance with G.S. 143-129. Such award shall constitute authority for the mayor or city manager to execute all documents required in conjunction with such contract on behalf of the city council. 
(b)  All contracts, regardless of the amount of expenditure, shall be awarded by the city council and executed by the mayor when so required by state or federal law. 
(c)  Contracts of any amount for the purchase of gasoline, diesel fuel, alcohol fuel, motor oil, fuel oil, or natural gas may be awarded and executed by the city manager, subject to compliance with G.S. § 143-131. 
(d)  Contracts for sponsorships of city facilities, programs, or services may be awarded and executed by the city manager pursuant to city policy as set forth by city council. 
(e)  Contracts for construction or repair work requiring the estimated expenditure of public money in an amount less than the limit set forth in G.S. § 143-129 may be awarded and executed by the city manager. All other contracts of any nature not addressed by the above subsections, and having a value of less than ninety thousand dollars ($90,000.00), may be awarded and executed by the city manager. Contracts not addressed by this, or any of the above subsections, having a value of ninety thousand dollars ($90,000.00) or greater, shall be awarded by the city council. 
(f)  Contract amendments and change orders. The city manager may award and execute contract amendments and change orders, of any nature or in any combination, number, or cumulative amount, so long as the original contract budget or value authorized or amended by city council is not increased by more than the amount the city manager could have authorized had the amendment or change order been an original contract of the same nature. The city manager shall report the execution of any contract amendments or change orders having the value of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or more, including the amount and purpose, to the city council on a monthly basis. 
(g)  Emergencies. G.S. § 143-129(e)(2) provides an exception to the standard procedural requirements for contracting in cases of special emergency involving the health and safety of people or their property. If, during the existence of a proclaimed state of emergency, the expeditious award of contracts involving the health and safety of the people or their property are reasonably necessary to address the emergency, the city manager is authorized to award contracts without regard to the amount of such contract in compliance with the requirements of G.S. 143-129(e)(2). As soon as reasonably possible after the state of emergency has ended, any contracts executed by the city manager pursuant to this emergency exception shall be placed on a city council meeting agenda for ratification and approval by council. 
(h)  In exercising the authority to contract granted in this section 2-36, the city manager shall not enter into any contract unless: 
(1)  The city council shall have approved a sufficient appropriation therefor in the annual budget for the current fiscal year, in compliance with the Local Government Budget and Fiscal Control Act; and 
(2)  The city attorney shall have approved such contract as to form.

Sec. 4-2. - False police and fire alarms. 
(a)  Definitions. Except as specifically defined herein, all words used in this chapter shall have their customary dictionary definitions. Certain words or terms used herein are defined as follows: 
    Alarm company: Any private individual or business entity licensed under G.S. Ch. 74D that installs, monitors, or services any alarm system within the City of Wilmington. 
    Alarm system: Any electronic or mechanical device transmitting an alarm signal outside the location, intended to alert law enforcement personnel to an actual or attempted unauthorized entry into a building or to the commission or attempted commission of a crime, or intended to alert fire or emergency medical personnel to an actual or suspected fire or medical emergency. This definition shall include, but not be limited to, "silent," audible and direct telephone dialer alarms. 
    False alarm: The activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, his employees or agents, which summons a response from the Wilmington Police Department and/or the Wilmington Fire Department. An alarm is false within the meaning of this section if the responding unit finds no evidence of fire, products of combustion, medical emergency or evidence of unauthorized intrusion, robbery, or other such crime or evidence of the attempt to commit such crime in or on the premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a false alarm shall not include an alarm which can be clearly shown by the subscriber to have been caused or activated by an act of nature. 
    Subscriber: Any person, corporation, partnership or other entity owning, leasing or operating an alarm system within the City of Wilmington. 
(b)  Automatic dialing devices. It shall be unlawful for any person to use any device which dials a telephone number within the police department. 
(c)  Automatic disconnection device. Audible alarm signals in close proximity to a residential area shall have a device which automatically disconnects a signal not more than thirty (30) minutes after its initiation. Automatically disconnected audible alarm signals shall not be reset until fifteen (15) minutes have elapsed. 
(d)  Maintenance and testing of alarm systems. It is the responsibility of each alarm user to notify the central monitoring station when servicing or performing maintenance on an alarm system within the City of Wilmington and to place that alarm system in a test mode at the central monitoring station during such service or maintenance. The purpose of this procedure is to avoid false alarms during service or maintenance. Servicing or maintenance as used in this part includes the deliberate testing of an alarm system. 
(e)  False alarm responses; service fees. If an alarm is determined to be a false alarm, as defined hereinabove, a warning will be issued to the subscriber for the first occurrence. Thereafter, a service fee, as approved by the city council and included in the city's fee schedule, shall be charged to the subscriber for each response to a false alarm. The city may seek to recover service fees by filing a civil action in the nature of a debt.

(c)  Each horse-drawn carriage company may be awarded up to four (4) standard operating medallions, restricting the number of horse-drawn vehicles for hire in operation by any one (1) horse-drawn carriage company at one time to four (4) horse-drawn vehicles for hire, except as provided below in section 4-216. 
(d)  For each standard operating medallion issued within the city, the horse-drawn carriage company possessing that medallion shall be assessed an annual fee per medallion, as set forth in the city's fee schedule. 
(e)  Standard operating medallions shall only be issued after the owner/operator of a horse-drawn carriage company has provided the city manager or his designee with a complete listing of all potential regular routes that the horse-drawn vehicles for hire owned by that horse-drawn carriage company intend to take, and such routes have been approved by the city manager or his designee, after consultation with any appropriate city staff.

On-street carriage loading zones will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis, based upon the date on which each horse-drawn carriage company began to legally operate within the city. Once a location is chosen by the first company in operation, the next company will choose from the remainder of the available locations on the list, and continue in such fashion until all horse-drawn carriage companies have chosen a location. If one (1) horse-drawn carriage company ceases operation and/or no longer requires use of its chosen carriage loading zone location, that location will be offered to the remaining horse-drawn carriage companies in operation in the order of when those companies began legally operating in the city. 
(l)  Each horse-drawn carriage company that chooses to operate out of an approved carriage loading zone location is required to keep that location clean and sanitized from all horse waste and debris during all periods of operation.

Pursuant to the state law and applicable Charter provisions, ordinances, rules and regulations, the city can grant revocable and non-exclusive franchises to construct, operate and maintain a telecommunication system within the city and in the public rights-of-way. The specific locations of the telecommunication system in the public rights-of-way shall be subject to the approval of the city engineer pursuant to the terms of a franchise and other applicable local ordinances. The franchise shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the services of a telecommunication system pursuant to a grantee's certificates of public convenience and necessity and the North Carolina public utilities laws and regulations. By acceptance of a franchise, grantee acknowledges and accepts the legal right of the city to issue the franchise. 
(c)  Use of public rights-of-way. For the purpose of operating and maintaining a telecommunication system within the city, a grantee may erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along the public rights-of-way within the city such cabinets, cables, conduits, converters, drains, equipment, handholes, splice boxes, location markers, vaults and other appurtenances as are necessary to the operation of the telecommunication system, provided, however, that, subject to applicable law, any grantee shall comply with all design, construction, safety, and performance provisions contained in the franchise, this article and other applicable local ordinances.

Subject to applicable law, grantee shall comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the city pursuant to that power. Nothing in this article or the franchise shall be deemed to be a waiver of the lawful, publicly available requirements of the various codes, ordinances, regulations, standards and specifications regarding permits, fees to be paid, or manner of construction. 
(f)  Franchise nonexclusive. Any franchise granted by the city is non-exclusive. The city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, additional franchises in accordance with state and federal law, provided any telecommunication system franchise granted by the city contains substantially equivalent standards, terms and conditions as are contained herein or any amendments to this article. 
(g)  Time is of the essence of the franchise. Subject to applicable law, whenever a franchise shall set forth any time for an act to be performed by or on behalf of the grantee, such time shall be deemed of the essence and any failure of the grantee to perform within the time allotted shall always be sufficient material ground for the city to invoke an appropriate penalty including possible revocation of the franchise.

(b)  Fee in addition to taxes. Any franchise fee payment shall be in addition to any other fees, tax or payment owed by the grantee to the city or other taxing jurisdiction. Payment of any franchise fee by grantee to the city shall be in addition to any and all taxes which are now or may be required hereafter to be paid by any federal, state, or local law.

(d)  Failure to make required payment. In the event that any franchise payment or installment thereof is not made on or before the dates specified herein or in the franchise, grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the city's primary depository bank during the period that such unpaid amount is owed.

Such permits and approvals shall not be necessary for placement or installation of connections from an existing telecommunication system to a customer or group of customers located on property adjacent to the existing system. 
(e)  Requirement for underground installations. All installations shall be underground in those areas of the city where all utilities and cable serving the area are underground at the time of installation. If technologically feasible and subject to the provisions of a grantee's tariffs on file with the North Carolina Utilities Commission, if any, and any applicable laws or regulations, at such time as all utilities and cable serving an area are required to be placed underground by the city or are placed underground, a grantee shall likewise place its services underground.

(h)  Excavation and work in public rights-of-way; restoration; damage. 
(1)  If feasible, a grantee shall install cable under pavement, curb, gutters, sidewalks, driveways, or other surfacing in the public rights-of-way by boring, and, where necessary for the protection of existing improvements, a grantee shall install such cable by directional boring. A grantee may excavate or disturb pavement, curb, gutters, sidewalks, driveways, or other surfacing in the public rights-of-way as necessary for placement of underground facilities. Manholes, handholes and markers may be visible, but shall not extend above grade in residential areas unless approved by the city engineer. 
(2)  Excavations or borings made by a grantee in the public rights-of-way, pursuant to the franchise shall be made in compliance with the lawful, publicly available ordinances and regulations of the city in effect at the time of such excavation, but only to the extent such ordinances and regulations are not contrary to specific requirements imposed upon the grantee by the North Carolina Utilities Commission. 
(3)  Prior to any excavation or boring in the public rights-of-way, a grantee shall notify all other utilities that may be affected by such excavation or boring of the nature of the work to be performed. The services of North Carolina One-Call may be used to notify or protect its member utilities.

(6)  A grantee shall exercise due care in the operation, installation, alteration, repair or removal of its system. If any utility or property of the city, real or personal, is damaged, impaired or destroyed, ordinary wear and tear excepted, as a result of either the negligent or intentional acts of a grantee, its employees, agents or persons operating under its direction, supervision or control, the grantee shall be liable to the city for such damages, including but not limited to the reasonable cost to repair or replace the utility or property. 
(7)  Immediately after a grantee installs or repairs its system, the grantee shall promptly and properly refill any excavations according to the lawful, publicly available specifications of the city. A grantee shall restore and replace landscaping destroyed, disturbed, or damaged by such work in accordance with the lawful, publicly available specifications of the city and subject to inspection by the city engineer. 
(8)  If the installation, alteration, repair or removal of the telecommunication system in the public rights-of-way requires the temporary removal of bricks, grates, trees or other property or materials belonging to the city, a grantee shall, until such materials are reinstalled, and in the exercise of due care, store said property or materials in a safe place satisfactory to the city to minimize the risk of damage or theft. 
(9)  A grantee shall preserve and protect all trees and shrubbery located in the public rights-of-way from damage by the grantee. A grantee shall comply with the regulations of the city concerning the preservation and protection of trees and shrubs. A grantee shall pay to the city the cost of treating, removing and replacing any tree or shrub in the public rights-of-way which has been damaged or destroyed as a result of the work of the grantee. 
(10)  If a grantee fails, neglects, or refuses to refill such excavations within a reasonable period of time not to exceed two (2) business days except in the event of emergency or other agreed special contingency after the telecommunication system has been installed, repaired or removed, or fails, neglects or refuses to restore the landscaping as herein provided within ten (10) business days except in the event of emergency or other agreed special contingency after the telecommunication system has been installed, repaired or removed, then after notice by the city, the grantee shall pay a deposit to the city in an amount equal to one hundred (100) percent of the estimated cost as determined by the city engineer to do all or such part of said work as may remain undone. The city may also contract with a third party to do all or such part of said work as may remain undone at the cost and expense of the grantee. 
Upon completion of the work by the city and after the total cost has been determined, if the amount of a grantee's deposit exceeds the total cost of the work, any excess will be refunded to the grantee, without interest, within fifteen (15) days of official acceptance of the work by the city. If the amount of a grantee's deposit is less than one hundred (100) percent of the city's final cost, the grantee shall pay to the city within fifteen (15) days of written notification, such additional amounts as will bring the total funds deposited equal to the total cost of the work. All work performed by the city or on the city's behalf shall be promptly inspected by the city, and any moneys due grantees shall be promptly refunded within not more than thirty (30) days of the completion of the work.

Provided, however, this requirement shall not preclude the grantee from being eligible for reimbursement from any federal, state, or other funds provided or to be provided by any entity other than the city for locating or relocating, moving or removing grantee's facilities. Sufficient notice of the need to remove or relocate of not less than ninety (90) days will be given to the extent practicable.

Sec. 4-244. - Forfeiture or revocation. 
(a)  Grounds for revocation. Subject to applicable law, the city reserves the right to revoke a franchise and rescind all rights and privileges associated with a franchise in accordance with the procedures set forth in this article in the following circumstances, each of which shall represent a default and breach under the franchise: 
(1)  If a grantee defaults in the performance of any of the material obligations under this article and the franchise. 
(2)  If a grantee fails to provide or maintain in full force and effect the liability and other insurance coverage or the security fund as required in this article. 
(3)  If a grantee violates any orders or rulings of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over the grantee relative to this article or the franchise and after notice thereof shall continue the violation and not remedy the same within sixty (60) days. 
(4)  If a grantee attempts to evade any of the provisions of this article or the franchise or practices any fraud or deceit upon the city. 
(5)  If a grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts or is adjudged bankrupt. 
(6)  If a grantee is no longer regulated either by the North Carolina Utilities Commission or the Federal Communications Commission. 
(7)  If a grantee materially misrepresents facts in the application for or negotiation of the franchise or any extension or renewal thereof. 
(8)  If the transferee of a grantee fails or refuses to accept the franchise as required in this article. 
(b)  Effect of circumstances beyond control of grantee. A grantee shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any provision of this article in any case in which performance of any such provision is prevented for reasons beyond a grantee's control. A fault shall not bee deemed to be beyond the grantee's control if committed by a corporation or other business entity in which the grantee holds a controlling interest whether held directly or indirectly. 
(c)  Pending litigation. Pending litigation or any appeal to any regulatory body or court having jurisdiction over a grantee shall not excuse the grantee from the performance of its obligations under this article or the franchise. The city and grantee will abide by the terms of any stay order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)  Procedure prior to revocation. 
(1)  The city shall make written demand that a grantee comply with any material requirement; limitation, term condition, rule or regulation or correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If the failure, refusal or neglect of a grantee continues for a period of thirty (30) days following such written demand, the city shall place its request for termination of the grantee's franchise upon a regular council meeting agenda. The city shall cause to be served upon such grantee at least seven (7) days prior to the date of such council meeting, a written notice of this intent to request such termination, and the time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published by the city clerk at least once, seven (7) days before such meeting, in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. 
(2)  The council shall hear any persons interested in the franchise and shall determine, in its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause. 
(3)  If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause, as reasonably defined by the city, the council shall direct the grantee to comply within such time and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable. 
(4)  If the council shall determine such failure, refusal, or neglect by the grantee was without just cause, then the council shall, by resolution, declare that the grantee's franchise shall be terminated and the performance bond and letter of credit forfeited. 
(e)  Disposition of system. In the event a grantee's franchise is revoked or otherwise terminated, the city may order the removal of that portion of the telecommunication system the continued presence of which would be contrary to the public safety or welfare, which is located in city owned conduit or duct, or which may interfere with the city's use of the right-of-way within a reasonable period of time. Otherwise, the telecommunication system may be abandoned in place. If any portion of the telecommunication system is abandoned in place, the grantee shall file with the city drawings or maps identifying the location of such abandoned system and if required by the city, shall submit to the city an instrument, satisfactory in form to the city, transferring to the city the ownership of such abandoned portion of the telecommunication system. 
(f)  Restoration of property. In removing its telecommunication system, grantee shall not excavate or disturb pavement, curb, gutters, sidewalks, driveways, or other surfaces in the public rights-of-way. The grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation and boring that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways in as good a condition or better as that prevailing prior to the grantee's removal of its telecommunication system without affecting the electrical, television, telephone or other telecommunication cable, wires or attachments or the utilities. The city shall inspect and approve the condition of the public rights-of-way and cables, wires, attachments, and poles after removal. The liability, indemnity, insurance, performance bond and letter of credit as provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal until full compliance by the grantee with the terms and conditions of this paragraph and the franchise. 
(g)  Abandonment. If such removal and restoration is not completed by grantee within one hundred eighty (180) days after notice by the city, all of the grantee's property remaining in the public rights-of-way shall, at the option of the city, be deemed abandoned and shall, at the option of the city, become the property of the city. 
(h)  Restoration by city; reimbursement of costs. In the event of a failure by the grantee to complete any work required by paragraph (f) above, or any other work required by city ordinance, within the time as may be established and to the satisfaction of the city, the city may cause such work to be done and the grantee shall reimburse the city the cost thereof within fifteen (15) days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs or the city may recover such costs from the security fund provided by grantee. The city may also seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this section. 
(i)  Reserved.

In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the plant, property and equipment of the grantee or any part thereof, including or excluding the franchise, the city may serve notice of termination upon the grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the grantee thereunder shall cease and terminate thirty (30) days after service of such notice, unless: 
(1)  The North Carolina Utilities Commission shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, in accordance with its rules and regulations, and

(a)  Security fund. 
(1)  At the time a franchise is accepted and for the term of the franchise and any extensions or renewals thereof, the grantee shall issue and deliver to, and maintain with the city a letter of credit from a federally-insured banking institution that has an office in the State of North Carolina, in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) and a performance bond issued by a surety licensed in the State of North Carolina in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).

e.  The damages or loss of revenue caused by a grantee's assignment of the franchise without the approval of the North Carolina Utilities Commission when such approval is required by law. 
(3)  A grantee shall not use the security fund for other purposes and shall not assign, pledge or otherwise use the security fund as security for any purpose. During the term of the franchise, the letter of credit shall be maintained in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), and the performance bond shall be maintained in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). 
(b)  Change in amount of letter of credit. Upon written application by a grantee, the city may, at its sole option, permit the amount of the letter of credit to be reduced or waive the requirements for a letter of credit. Reductions granted or denied upon application by a grantee shall be without prejudice to the grantee's subsequent applications or to the city's right to require the full letter of credit at any time thereafter. However, no application shall be made by a grantee within one (1) year of any prior application. 
(c)  Payment from security fund. 
(1)  If a grantee fails to pay to the city any payment due under the terms of the franchise; or, fails to repay to the city, any damages, costs or expenses which the city shall be compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of the grantee in connection with the franchise, the city may then demand payment from the security fund. 
(2)  The letter of credit shall be made payable upon a draft submitted by the city and accompanied by the written statement of an appropriately authorized official for the city that payment is due the city under the terms of the franchise as a result of a default by grantee. The city shall be the beneficiary under the performance bond.

(b)  Insurance policies. 
(1)  All insurance policies maintained pursuant to the franchise shall contain the following, or a comparable, endorsement: 
It is hereby understood and agreed that this insurance policy may not be canceled by the insurance company and the intention not to renew may not be stated by the insurance company until thirty (30) days after receipt by the city manager, by registered mail or certified mail, of a written notice of such intention to cancel or not to renew.

Sec. 4-249. - Liquidated damages. 
(a)  Liquidated damages. The city and the grantee understand and agree that grantee's violation of any of the time and performance requirements set forth in this article or in the franchise may result in damage to the city and that it is and will be impracticable to determine the actual amount of such damage in the event of delay or nonperformance. Accordingly, subject to applicable law, whenever the city determines, consistent with subsection (b) hereinafter, that the grantee has violated any such requirement, the city may charge the grantee and collect from the security fund, as necessary, the following liquidated damages: 
(1)  For failure to maintain with the city engineer drawings required by section 4-240 of this article, the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for each day, or part thereof, such failure occurs or continues. 
(2)  For failure to comply with construction or maintenance standards over which the city has authority and jurisdiction, the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day for each day, or part thereof, such failure occurs or continues. 
(3)  For failure to comply with all conditions of city permits, the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for each day, or part thereof, such failure occurs or continues. 
(b)  Unavoidable delay. No charge shall be made to the security fund for an unavoidable delay. For purposes of this section, "Unavoidable delay" means that period of time during which the grantee is delayed from complying with the time and performance requirements of the franchise because of acts of God, strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances, acts of public enemy, orders of any kind of the government of the United States or of the state or any civil or military authority, insurrections, riots, epidemics, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, storms, floods, washouts, drought, arrest, restraining of government and people, civil disturbances, explosions, partial or entire failure of utilities or equipment, shortages of labor, materials, supplies or transportation, or any other similar cause not reasonably within the control of the grantee, but not including reasonably anticipated weather conditions for the city's geographic area or reasonably anticipated difficulties with equipment, suppliers or shippers. 
(c)  Procedure for imposition of liquidated damages. 
(1)  Whenever the city finds that a grantee has violated one or more terms, conditions or provisions of this article or the franchise, a written notice shall be sent to grantee informing it of such violation or liability. The written notice shall describe in reasonable detail the specific violation so as to afford the grantee an opportunity to remedy the violation. Grantee shall begin corrective action within ten (10) business days after receipt of such notice. Grantee may, within ten (10) business days of receipt of notice, notify the city that there is a dispute as to whether a violation or failure has, in fact, occurred; provided, however, that if the last day of the ten-day period falls on a day on which the City Hall is closed, the period shall be extended to include the next day on which City Hall is open for business. Such notice by grantee to the city shall specify with particularity the matters disputed by grantee and shall stay the running of the above-described time. In the event grantee fails to request a hearing, then grantee shall be deemed to have waived any defense whatsoever to the violation alleged. 
a.  The city council shall hear grantee's dispute at a meeting called in a timely manner. Grantee shall be afforded reasonable notice of the meeting and afforded a reasonable opportunity to participate in and be heard at this meeting. The city or its designee shall supplement any decision with written findings of fact. 
b.  If after hearing the dispute the claim is upheld by council, the grantee shall have ten (10) business days from such a determination to remedy the violation or failure. At any time after that ten-day period, the city may draw against the security fund all damages due it as determined by the city. 
(2)  The time for a grantee to correct any violation or liability may be extended by the city if the necessary action to correct such violation or liability is of such a nature or character to require more than ten (10) days within which to perform, provided grantee commenced the corrective action within the ten-day period and thereafter uses reasonable diligence, as determined by the city, to correct the violation or liability. 
(3)  The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city whether reserved by the franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the city may have.

In the event that such law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed so that the provision which had been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with the law, rules and regulations then in effect, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on the grantee and the city. 
(b)  Court action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event that any court, agency, commission, legislative body or other authority of competent jurisdiction declares any portion of this article or the franchise deemed by the city to be material, invalid in whole or in part; requires grantee to perform any act which is inconsistent with any portion deemed by the city to be material or requires grantee to cease performing any act deemed by the city to be material, the city shall so notify grantee and the city and grantee shall, in good faith, renegotiate that term or those terms of the franchise.

DIVISION 6. - CONTROLLED PARKING IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS 

Sec. 5-89. - Regulation of controlled parking in residential areas. 
(a)  Purpose. The city council hereby declares that: 
(1)  It is in the best interests of the City of Wilmington to reduce vehicular congestion on residential streets and to facilitate the efficient movement of traffic by providing for residential parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the week within certain areas meeting the criteria hereinafter set forth; 
(2)  That residential permit parking regulation is necessary to promote the health, safety and welfare of the residents of Wilmington by providing adequate parking spaces for residents adjacent to or close by their place of residence and by separating parking for commercial uses from residential parking; 
(3)  It is in the public interest to reduce hazardous traffic conditions resulting from the use of streets located within congested residential areas for the parking of vehicles by persons using such residential areas to gain access to other places; to protect those areas from unreasonable burdens in gaining access to their residences; to preserve the character of those areas as residential districts; to promote efficiency in the maintenance of those streets in a clean and safe condition; to preserve the value of the property in those areas; to preserve the safety of children and other pedestrians and to promote traffic safety, clean air, and the comfort, health, convenience and welfare of the inhabitants of the city. 
(b)  Designation of areas. The city council may designate controlled parking in residential areas based on the following minimum criteria as determined in a study by the city manager or his designee. The study shall be initiated in accordance with the procedures set forth in the administrative policy for "Traffic Management in Residential Neighborhoods." 
(1)  The area is contiguous or nearly contiguous area containing streets or parts thereof primarily abutted by property which is zoned residential on the official zoning maps of the City of Wilmington; and 
(2)  For any time period during the week proposed for regulation hereunder, the number of vehicles parked or standing legally or illegally, on the streets in the area is equal to seventy (70) percent or more of the legal on-street parking capacity of the area with twenty-five (25) percent or more of the vehicles parked or standing on the streets in the area being registered in the name of persons not residing in the area; or 
(3)  During any period as described in item (2) above, any nonresident vehicles utilize the parking to patronize commercial establishments in adjacent areas; and 
(4)  The residents of the area have difficulty or are unable to secure adequate on-street parking adjacent to or close by their places of residence because of widespread use of available parking spaces in that area by nonresident transient motorists or the effects of the nonresident parking are detrimental to the residential character of the area; and 
(5)  The residents of the area desire the institution of a parking permit system and have shown a willingness to bear the administrative costs incidental to the issuance of permits authorized by this section. 
(c)  Parking regulations in permit areas. Following the designation of a controlled parking residential area by the city council, the area shall be posted with signs or other traffic control devices indicating the times, locations and conditions under which parking shall be by permit only. No person shall park any vehicle in a designated controlled parking residential area during the hours set forth in the ordinance designating the controlled parking area, unless the vehicle displays a current parking permit for such residential area issued in accordance with this section. 
(d)  Issuance of residential parking permits. Following the designation of a controlled parking residential area, the chief of police or his designee shall issue appropriate residential parking permits. A resident of a controlled parking residential area is eligible to receive one resident parking permit for each vehicle which is principally operated by the resident and one additional resident parking permit per household. The chief of police shall verify the residence address of persons obtaining such permits and shall record on the face of the permit the letter designation of the controlled parking residential area for which issued. As proof of residency, the chief of police may require utility bills, notarized affidavits of the landlord, auto registration cards and other documentation deemed necessary naming the permittee and showing an address within the controlled parking area. The permit shall be valid for a calendar year and shall be renewed for each successive calendar year. 
(e)  Privileges and restrictions on residential parking permits. 
(1)  The holder of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or park a motor vehicle displaying the permit and operated by him in any designated residential controlled parking area during such times and places as the parking of motor vehicles is permitted. A residential parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve to the holder a parking space within a designated controlled parking residential area. 
(2)  A residential parking permit shall not authorize the holder thereof to stand or park a motor vehicle in such places or during such times as the stopping, standing or parking the motor vehicle is prohibited or set aside for specific types of vehicles, nor exempt the holder from the observance of any traffic regulation other than the limitation on parking within the controlled parking residential area. 
(3)  It shall constitute a violation of this section for any person to falsely represent himself as eligible for a residential parking permit or to furnish any false information in an application to the chief of police in order to obtain a residential parking permit. 
(4)  The chief of police is authorized to revoke the residential parking permit of any permittee found to be in violation of this section; and, upon written notification thereof, the permittee shall surrender such permit to the chief of police. Failure, when so requested, to surrender a residential parking permit so revoked shall constitute a violation of this section.

In the case of a health or safety hazard vehicle or a junked motor vehicle, if the names and mailing addresses of the registered owner or person entitled to the possession of the vehicle or the owner, lessee, or occupant of the real property upon which the vehicle is located can be ascertained in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the notice shall be given by first class mail.

The notice shall state that the vehicle will be removed by the city on a specified date, no sooner than seven (7) days after the notice is affixed or mailed, unless the vehicle is moved by the owner or legal possessor prior to that time. 
    With respect to abandoned vehicles on private property, junked and health or safety hazard motor vehicles to which notice is required to be given, if the registered owner or person entitled to possession does not remove the vehicle but chooses to appeal the determination that the vehicle is abandoned, a health or safety hazard vehicle or in the case of a junked motor vehicle that the aesthetic benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens, such appeal shall be made to the city manager in writing. The city manager shall fix a time for the hearing within thirty (30) days of the appeal and further proceedings to remove the vehicle shall be stayed until the appeal is heard and decided. 
(Ord. of 5-21-91, § 1) 
Sec. 5-115. - Exceptions to prior notice requirement. 
    The requirement that notice be given prior to the removal of an abandoned, junked or health or safety hazard vehicle may, as determined by the authorizing official, be omitted in those circumstances where there is a special need for prompt action to eliminate traffic obstructions or to otherwise maintain and protect the public safety and welfare. Such findings shall, in all cases, be entered by the authorizing official in the appropriate daily records. Circumstances justifying the removal of vehicles without prior notice include but are not limited to: 
(a)  Vehicles abandoned on the streets. For vehicles left on the public streets and highways, the city council hereby determines that immediate removal of such vehicles may be warranted when they are:

(3)  Parked in a no-stopping or standing zone, 
(4)  Parked in loading zones,

(b)  Other abandoned or health or safety hazard vehicles. With respect to abandoned or health or safety hazard vehicles left on city-owned property other than the streets and highways, and on private property, such vehicles may be removed without giving prior notice only in those circumstances where the authorizing official finds a special need for prompt action to protect and maintain the public health, safety and welfare. By way of illustration and not of limitation, such circumstances include vehicles blocking or obstructing ingress or egress to businesses and residences, vehicles parked in such a location or manner as to pose a traffic hazard, and vehicles causing damage to public or private property. 
(Ord. of 5-21-91, § 1) 
Sec. 5-116. - Notice when vehicle removed; hearing. 
    Because businesses qualified in accordance with section 5-117 to tow vehicles at the request of the police department are responsible for collecting towing fees, the provisions of Article 7A of Chapter 20 (section 20-219.9 et seq.) of the North Carolina General Statutes concerning notice, hearing and other procedures shall be applicable when vehicles are towed pursuant to this article. 
(Ord. of 5-21-91, § 1) 
Sec. 5-116.1. - Towing; storage. 
(a)  All towing and storage charges incurred in connection with impounded vehicles shall constitute a lien upon such vehicles as provided in G.S. section 44A-2, and no stored vehicle shall be released until all such charges have been paid to the owner of the garage where the impounded vehicle is stored or the lien has been extinguished as provided in G.S. section 20-222. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or attempt to remove from any storage facility qualified by the city any vehicle which has been impounded pursuant to the provisions of this code unless and until all towing and impoundment fees which are due, or bond in lieu of such fees, have been paid. 
(Ord. of 5-21-91, § 1) 
Sec. 5-116.2. - Conditions on removal of vehicles from private property.

The city may require any person requesting the removal of an abandoned, or junked or health or safety hazard motor vehicle from private property to indemnify the city against any loss, expense or liability incurred because of the removal, storage, or sale thereof. 
(Ord. of 5-21-91, § 1) 
Sec. 5-116.3. - Protection against criminal or civil liability. 
    No person shall be held to answer in any civil or criminal action to any owner or other person legally entitled to the possession of an abandoned, junked or health or safety hazard motor vehicle, for disposing of such vehicle as provided in this chapter. 
(Ord. of 5-21-91, § 1) 
Sec. 5-116.4. - Exceptions. 
(a)  Nothing in this chapter shall apply to any vehicle: (1) which is located in a bona fide "automobile graveyard" or "junkyard" as defined in N.C.G.S. 136-143, in accordance with the "Junkyard Control Act", N.C.G.S. 136-141, et seq.; (2) which is in an enclosed building; (3) which is on the premises of a business enterprise being operated in a lawful place and manner if the vehicle is necessary to the operation of the enterprise; (4) which is in an appropriate storage place or depository maintained in a lawful place and manner by the city; or (5) which is used on a regular basis for business or personal use. 
(b)  For the purposes of this section, the terms "lawful place and manner" shall include, but not be limited to, strict compliance with the city's zoning ordinance. "A vehicle is necessary to the operation of the enterprise" shall mean, but not be limited to, the clear, active use or involvement of the vehicle in the operation of the business enterprise. Mere storage or idle standing of a vehicle does not constitute "a vehicle necessary to the operation of the business." 
(Ord. of 5-21-91, § 1) 
Sec. 5-116.5. - No restrictions on other authority. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the legal authority or powers of officers of the city police department and fire department, city code enforcement officers or other public officials in enforcing other laws or in otherwise carrying out their duties.

(a)  No person, firm or corporation shall erect, place or maintain any benches, chairs, planters or other street furniture on any publicly owned rights-of-way without first having obtained a permit from the city. The city manager, or designee, may issue a permit for the placement of benches, chairs, planters, or other street furniture at specified locations along publicly-owned rights-of-way on a sidewalk, sidewalk area, shoulder or plaza provided the following criteria are met: 
(1)  The use of benches, chairs, or planters, and other street furniture should be designed to enhance and blend in with the surroundings. Street furniture shall not be permitted if it endangers the public health and safety or prohibits pedestrian passage along the public right-of-way entrance to any establishment. 
(2)  The placement of street furniture must be within the four (4) feet closest to the building, with benches and planters placed flush against building fronts. The placement of furniture may not extend beyond the sidewalk or pedestrian way frontage of the associated business. 
(3)  No street furniture may be placed in any location whereby the clear, unobstructed space for the passageway of pedestrians is reduced to less than four (4) feet (as measured from the street edge of the sidewalk). Trees, poles, signs, hydrants, trash receptacles, tree grates, etc. are all considered obstructions. 
(4)  Street furniture shall not be anchored and must be easily removed from the public right-of-way. 
(5)  The owner is required to maintain the street furniture and the area surrounding its placement in a clean and safe condition. 
(b)  Application for a permit shall be made on forms provided by the city to the code enforcement office.

(d)  Permits issued pursuant to this section may be revoked due to public need of the right-of-way, non-compliance with the provisions of this section, or any other reason deemed sufficient to the city. If, upon revocation, the street furniture is not removed upon twenty-four (24) hours' notice, the city shall have the right to remove and dispose of such street furniture and may assess the property owner for the cost of such removal and disposal.

Sec. 11-46. - Newsracks on public rights-of-way. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish a comprehensive set of regulations applicable to newsracks located within the public right-of-way and on other public property. There are a number of important public purposes served by regulation of newsracks. First, newsrack regulation is intended to improve public safety. Since newsracks are usually located within the public right-of-way, they pose a potential hazard to pedestrians and other users of public sidewalks. If they are located too close to driveways or intersections, they can block the view of oncoming traffic. If they are located too close to the curb, they can unreasonably hinder ingress and egress from parked vehicles. If located too close to fire hydrants, mailboxes, traffic control devices, public bus benches and other public conveniences, they can unreasonably hinder access to and use of those facilities. 
    A second purpose of the section is to protect the appearance of Wilmington.

If after due diligence the distributor's or publisher's current address cannot be determined, then the required notice shall be affixed to the newsrack. The notice affixed to the newsrack shall require the removal of the newsrack or provide for the reallocation of the space within ten (10) days of the date notice is affixed to the newsrack.

Sec. 11-80. - Powers reserved. 
    A utility right-of-way master permit does not constitute a grant of all governmental approval necessary for the use and operation of utility facilities located in the public right-of-way.

(1)  Require a utility work permit; 
(2)  Do not require a utility work permit but must be done in accordance with the standards set forth in this article; and 
(3)  Are exempt. 
The standards and policies shall also address emergency situations and activities. In the case of an emergency situation, the utility facility may be accessed for the necessary repairs and site control. Application and fees for all necessary permits must be made within reasonable time thereafter as determined by the city engineer. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful to install, maintain, repair, or remove any utility facility in the public right-of-way without a utility work permit if the standards adopted pursuant to subsection (a) require a utility work permit for such activities. 
(c)  If a utility work permit is required it shall be maintained at the site of the work. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-8, § 2, 2-3-09) 
Sec. 11-82. - Identification of contractors. 
    Any contractor or subcontractor performing utility work shall prominently identify at the work site and/or on any vehicles and equipment the utility on whose behalf the contractor or subcontractor is performing the utility work. Any contractor or subcontractor performing utility work shall promptly identify itself and the utility on whose behalf the contractor or subcontractor is performing the utility work when requested to do so by the city engineer. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-8, § 2, 2-3-09) 
Sec. 11-83. - Maps of utility facilities. 
    To the maximum extent practicable, each utility must maintain accurate maps and records of its facilities. If the utility has offices within New Hanover County, the utility shall maintain such maps and records at its offices and shall give the city access to such maps and records during normal business hours of the utility. At the request of the city, the utility shall make copies of such maps and records available to the city. If the utility does not have offices within New Hanover County, it shall provide such information to the city in electronic format compatible with city software within five (5) days of request by the city engineer. The maps and records shall depict horizontal locations of all facilities in and near the public right-of-way. To the extent the information is available, the maps and records also shall depict the vertical locations of all facilities. The utility shall upon reasonable notice provide such assistance as the city may require to determine the actual field locations of the utility's facilities when such locations must be determined for a public purpose of the city. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-8, § 2, 2-3-09) 
Sec. 11-84. - Removal and relocation of utility facilities; street closures. 
(a)  Whenever the city or the city acting in concert with the North Carolina Department of Transportation or its successor shall construct, maintain or repair any public improvement in a public right-of-way or shall widen, modify, close, relocate, grade or resurface any public street, sidewalk, or other public way in which a utility shall have installed any utility facility, and such work requires the removal or relocation of the utility facility or a portion thereof, it shall be the duty of the utility, upon reasonable notice by the proper authority, and at no cost to the city, to remove or relocate as necessary its utility facility; provided, however, this requirement shall not preclude the utility from being eligible for reimbursement from any federal, state, or other funds provided or to be provided by any entity other than the city for locating or relocating, moving or removing the utility's facilities. Notice to the utility of the need to remove or relocate facilities shall be reasonable in relation to the scope of work required to be performed by the utility, and generally shall not be less than ninety (90) days unless it is not practicable to give such notice or the scope of work to be performed by the utility is limited and a shorter notice period gives the utility sufficient time to do the work. Where such notice is given, then a utility shall perform such work as the notice requires or as the utility deems necessary for the extension of new facilities or the repair of existing facilities within said street prior to the time the city begins paving or repaving of the street. 
(b)  To the extent permitted by law and where practical, the city will endeavor to reserve utility easements for existing utility facilities in any street or public alley permanently closed under G.S. § 160A-299 or withdrawn from dedication under G.S. § 136-96.

(Ord. No. O-2009-8, § 2, 2-3-09) 
Sec. 11-86. - Abandoned facilities. 
    A facility that is not used and maintained by a utility shall be deemed to be abandoned. Upon abandoning a facility, a utility shall remove the aboveground portions of the facility and shall abandon in place the underground portions of the facility and shall leave same in a safe condition in accordance with applicable safe work standards and codes and standards adopted by the city engineer under this article. The city engineer may require abandoned underground utility facilities to be removed in the public interest. A utility shall maintain maps of all utility facilities abandoned in place. The city, its officers, employees, agents, servants, and contractors shall not be liable to a utility for damage to or removal or destruction of an abandoned utility facility.

Any person performing such investigation shall notify the owner(s) of the existing utility facilities which shall be given the reasonable opportunity to observe the hand-digging, potholing, air-jetting or vacuum excavation around the existing utility facilities to prevent damage to those facilities. The city engineer may require subsurface investigations, at no costs to the city or to the owner(s) of the existing utility facilities, prior to a permit or release for construction in areas with potential facility conflicts or in areas where nonstandard configurations of facilities are encountered. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-8, § 2, 2-3-09) 
Sec. 11-93. - Adoption of standards. 
    The city engineer is authorized to adopt additional standards governing the location and making of excavations and the performance of utility work in, on, under, and over the public rights-of-way in order to achieve the purposes of this article. The standards shall cover the need for the submission and review of construction plans prior to the issuance of any permit. The type of plans and level of detail required for submission may be varied depending on the nature of the construction activities. The city engineer shall endeavor to submit proposed standards, policies and schedules of fees to utilities holding an unexpired and unrevoked franchise, license or utility right-of-way master permit issued by the city for review and comment, before such standards, policies or schedule of fees take effect. The failure to submit proposed standards, policies and schedules of fees to a utility shall not invalidate any such standards, policies or fees.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing such person shall: 
(1)  Promptly and properly refill any excavations according to the lawful, publicly available specifications and policies of the city; 
(2)  Restore and replace landscaping destroyed, disturbed, or damaged by such work in accordance with the lawful, publicly available specifications of the city and subject to inspection by the city engineer; 
(3)  If the work in the public rights-of-way requires the temporary removal of bricks, granite curbing, grates, trees or other property or materials belonging to the city, until such materials are reinstalled, and in the exercise of due care, deliver such materials to a location designated by the city or store said property or materials in a safe place satisfactory to the city to avoid damage or theft; 
(4)  Preserve and protect trees and shrubbery located in the public rights-of-way from damage by the permittee. Any person making an excavation or performing utility work in the public right-of-way shall comply with the regulations of the city concerning the preservation and protection of trees and shrubs. The franchise holder or permittee for the work shall pay to the city the cost of treating, removing and replacing any tree or shrub in the public right-of-way which has been damaged or destroyed as a result of the work; and 
(5)  Restore and replace any city-owned improvements destroyed, disturbed or damaged by such work including but not limited to signs, sidewalks and bike paths. 
(6)  Comply with the city's technical standards and specifications and/or North Carolina Department of Transportation standards for the excavation, backfill, compaction and installation of pavement. 
(b)  Restoration of pavement. The person making an excavation or performing utility work in the public right-of-way shall restore any pavement damaged by the excavation or work unless the city agrees to perform the restoration work. Nothing in this section shall relieve the person making an excavation or performing utility work from the responsibility to maintain the excavation or installation in a safe condition until it is repaved or otherwise restored. If the city agrees to restore the pavement, the person making an excavation or performing utility work shall pay to the city all applicable street cut application, and long-term resurfacing fees and all repair fees or the estimated cost of the restoration work, whichever is the higher amount. Where the nature and number of excavations or utility cuts significantly degrade the pavement surface within one (1) or more traffic lanes or portions of a block, the city engineer may require resurfacing sufficient to address the degradation such as resurfacing block to block and curb to curb. 
(c)  Responsibility for temporary repairs. The person making an excavation or performing utility work shall be responsible for all costs associated with maintaining the temporary repairs until the pavement is permanently restored. Such costs shall include, but not be limited to, the cost of traffic control and maintaining proper fill and compaction, temporary patches or plating and costs incurred by the city relating to the temporary repairs. 
(d)  Failure to make repairs. Except in the event of an emergency, if a person making an excavation or performing utility work in the public right-of-way fails, neglects, or refuses to make repairs to the public right-of-way, refill an excavation immediately after the work requiring the excavation or utility cut has been completed, or fails, neglects or refuses to restore landscaping, the city may provide for the repair and restoration and charge the cost to the person. 
(e)  Warranty for work in public right-of-way. Each franchise holder, licensee, utility and permittee for an excavation or utility work shall warrant its excavation and restoration work against all defects in workmanship and materials for a period of eighteen (18) months after final completion. Whenever within the eighteen (18) months period the city engineer determines that any portion of the pavement or surface of any public right-of-way affected by an excavation or utility work is in need of repairs, by reason of any defect in workmanship or materials, the city engineer shall serve upon the franchise holder, licensee, utility, or permittee a written notice stating the repairs necessary, and requiring the repairs to be made within thirty (30) days after the date of the notice unless the scope of the work to repair the defect is limited and a shorter notice period gives the utility sufficient time to do the work. If the repairs are not timely made, the city engineer shall at once make or cause the repairs to be made at the expense of the franchise holder, licensee, utility or permittee. The expenses, including any related administrative expenses, shall be charged to the franchise holder, utility or permittee, and the franchise holder, licensee, utility or permittee shall be obliged to pay the cost within thirty (30) days following receipt of notification of the expenses.

Persons shall determine alternative methods of making necessary repairs and facility installations to avoid utility work and excavations that are subject to this section. 
(b)  The city engineer, for good cause, shall grant a variance to an applicant for repair of existing utilities, to respond to emergencies, to comply with applicable state or federal regulations, or to afford a person the means to provide service to buildings that the person has no other reasonable means of serving in the determination of the city engineer. Variances shall be granted subject to special conditions that the city engineer determines to be appropriate to the circumstances, such as special coordination with other excavations and utility work, special paving requirements as referenced in section 11-96(b), additional soil compaction test reports, or any other requirements needed to restore the integrity of the public right-of-way to "as new" condition. In addition to the information provided on the submission of plans and/or application, the applicant shall provide the following with respect to that part of the public right-of-way subject to this provision: 
(1)  Reason why the excavation or utility work was not performed before or when the public right-of-way was paved; 
(2)  Reason why the excavation or utility work cannot be delayed until after the thirty-six-month period expires; and 
(3)  Reason why the excavation or utility work cannot be performed at reasonable cost at another location or the applicant's need cannot be accomplished by a method that does not require excavation or work in the public right-of-way.

ARTICLE III. - STORMWATER UTILITY AND ILLICIT DISCHARGES 
DIVISION 1. - STORMWATER UTILITY AND FEES 

Sec. 12-11. - Authority. 
    Pursuant to G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 16, the City of Wilmington is authorized to create a stormwater utility and establish a schedule of stormwater fees for property in the corporate limits. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-93, § 1, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 12-12. - Stormwater utility. 
    A stormwater utility is hereby established to provide stormwater management services, as authorized by state law. Stormwater service charges will be determined and modified from time to time so that the total revenues generated by said charges will be used to pay the principal of and interest on the debt incurred for stormwater purposes and such expenses as are reasonably necessary or convenient, in the planning, construction, operation, and maintenance of the stormwater system. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-93, § 1, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 12-13. - Service charges, rates and fee schedule. 
(a)  Stormwater service charges shall accrue beginning on July 1, 1998. Stormwater service charges shall apply to all property within the city limits that is served by the city's stormwater system without regard to ownership, except as set forth in section 12-14. Such charges shall be based on the amount of impervious surface on each parcel as determined by the equivalent residential unit standard. For purposes of this article, an "equivalent residential unit (ERU)" is two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of impervious surface. 
(b)  The city council shall set a base rate for single-family residential uses and charges for non-single-family residential uses shall be calculated utilizing the equivalent residential unit. For purposes of this article, a "non-single-family residential use" shall be any land use other than single-family residential, except for undeveloped land. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-93, § 1, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 12-14. - Exemptions and credits. 
    Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater service charges or receive a credit against such charges. 
(a)  Only undeveloped land shall be exempt from stormwater service fees. All other parcels including public road rights-of-way maintained by the City of Wilmington shall not be exempt from stormwater service charges. 
(b)  Properties subject to stormwater service fees may be granted credits against the fees in accordance with a credit policy manual developed by the city manager and referenced in the City of Wilmington Fee Schedule. Any non-single-family residential use that provides measures to mitigate the impacts of runoff on the stormwater system shall be eligible for a maximum credit of forty (40) percent of the service fee. The amount of the credit shall be proportional to the extent the measures address the impacts on peak discharge, total runoff volume and water quality as compared to applicable city, state and federal standards. Water quantity and water quality measures shall each be eligible for a twenty (20) percent maximum credit. Any credit allowance shall be conditional on continuing compliance with applicable standards, including requirements for operation and maintenance. Subject to approval in accordance with the credit policy, any credits shall be effective on the date of application therefore. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-93, § 1, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 12-15. - Billing method, responsible parties. 
(a)  Bills for stormwater service fees shall be sent at regular, periodic intervals. Stormwater service fees may be billed on a combined utility bill that also contains charges for water, sewer and/or refuse service. Stormwater service fees that are shown on a combined utility bill may be for a different service period than that used for water, sewer and/or refuse service. 
(b)  Townhouse and condominium developments and other similar properties containing impervious surface in common ownership shall be charged for the total impervious surface of all commonly owned and individually owned property within the development. The stormwater service bill shall be sent to the homeowners' association or, upon official request of the association reflecting a vote in accordance with the association's bylaws, may be billed on a pro rata basis to all townhouse and condominium owners. 
(c)  The property owner is responsible for payment of all stormwater service fees. 
(d)  Stormwater fees are billed and collected by Cape Fear Public Utility Authority on behalf of the city. Stormwater fees are due and payable simultaneously with any other fees included on the bill, including fees for solid waste, sewer and water. Payments on such bills are applied first to stormwater fees, second to solid waste fees, third to sewer fees and last to water fees. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-93, § 1, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 12-16. - Back billing. 
    Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. The owner of each parcel of developed land shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is under-billed or if no bill is sent for developed land, the city may back bill up to two (2) years. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-93, § 1, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 12-17. - Complaints regarding a bill. 
(a)  A customer having a grievance or complaint that a bill is excessive must file a written or verbal notice with the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority following their procedure for filing an inquiry. The notice must be sent within ten (10) days after the bill or notification of an assessment for a violation and/or service termination was received, or the complainant may pay the charges and inquire about them prior to the mailing of the next bill. If it is determined that the bill is in error, an adjustment will be made accordingly. 
(b)  No adjustment will be made for more than a two-year period immediately preceding the date that the customer's notice was received. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-93, § 1, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 12-18. - Appeal. 
    Any customer who believes the provisions of this article have been applied in error may appeal in the following manner: 
(a)  An appeal must be filed in writing with the city manager. At the discretion of the city manager, surface area and any other features or conditions which influence the hydrologic response of the property to rainfall events may be considered. 
(b)  A technical review shall be performed to determine the accuracy of the information in the city's impervious surface database. The city manager may adjust the fee or credit as long as the adjustment is in conformance with the intent of this article. At the conclusion of the review, the city manager shall issue a written determination stating whether an adjustment to the service rate is appropriate, and if so, the amount of such adjustment. 
(c)  All decisions of the city manager shall be served on the customer personally or by registered or certified mail. Service shall be based upon the billing address of the customer. 
(d)  The city manager may make no adjustment to a customer's bill for more than the two-year period immediately preceding the date that the customer's appeal is received by the city manager.

(21)  Other nonstormwater discharges for which a valid NPDES discharge permit has been approved and issued by the State of North Carolina, and provided that any such discharges to the stormwater system shall be authorized by the city; and 
(22)  Dye testing, using suitable dyes for verifying cross connections, tracing plumbing lines, determining flow direction or rate and for similar purpose. 
(b)  Prohibited substances. Prohibited substances include, but are not limited to, oil, wastewater, automotive fluids, household or industrial chemicals, animal waste, paint, garbage, yard debris, animal waste or carcasses, and litter. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-93, § 1, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 12-23. - Illicit connections. 
    No person shall install, maintain or use any connection to the stormwater system or waters of the state for the discharge of nonstormwater or shall cause nonstormwater to be discharged or conveyed through a connection to the stormwater system or waters of the state unless the discharge is a permitted discharge listed in section 12-22. This prohibition includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under the law at that time. Any illicit connections shall be disconnected and permanently and properly closed. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-93, § 1, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 12-24. - Accidental discharge or spills. 
    Spills or leaks of polluting substances released, discharged to, or having the potential to be released or discharged to the stormwater conveyance system, shall be immediately contained, controlled, collected, and properly disposed. All affected areas shall be restored to their preexisting condition. 
    If an accidental discharge to the stormwater system occurs, the responsible person shall immediately begin to collect and remove the discharge and restore all affected areas to their predischarge condition. The responsible person shall immediately notify emergency personnel and other authorities as appropriate, of the accidental discharge by telephone or other mode of instantaneous communication. The notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of pollutant, volume, time of discharge and corrective action taken. Such notification shall not relieve the responsible person of any of the expenses related to restoration, loss, damages or any other liability that may be incurred as a result; nor shall such notification relieve the responsible party from other liability that may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
    Any NPDES permitted entity that has an unauthorized release from their facility or from their operations that has the potential to reach the stormwater system shall report any and all releases to the city within forty-eight (48) hours of the release. The report will include all information that is required to be reported to the state under the terms of the permit and any other information deemed necessary by the city.

Secs. 12-25-12-27. - Reserved. 
Part 2. - Other Prohibited Waste 

Sec. 12-28. - Domestic animal waste. 
(a)  Findings. Pet waste is a serious water quality and public health issue for the Wilmington community. Stormwater runoff washes bacteria, parasites, viruses, and nutrients from pet waste directly into our waterways. Poor water quality caused by pet waste can cause recreational swimming advisories, shellfish bed closures, algal blooms, low dissolved oxygen levels, and impaired aquatic habitat. Fecal coli form bacteria, found in the feces of warm-blooded animals, can indicate that water is unsafe for human contact like fishing, swimming, and drinking. Many diseases can be spread to humans from pet waste as well. A strong pet waste ordinance encourages citizens to be responsible for cleaning up their animal's waste in order to keep our waterways clean and safeguard public health. 
(b)  Restrictions on domestic animal waste. 
(1)  No person in custody or control of any animal shall allow said animal to discharge any fecal matter on any public property unless the person in custody or control of said animal immediately and fully removes and disposes of the feces. Such public properties include, but are not limited to, streets, sidewalks, plazas, parks, rights-of-way, paths, public access areas, storm drains, ditches, streams, creeks, drainageways, other publicly owned property, and dedicated and officially accepted easements. 
(2)  It shall be unlawful for the owner or custodian of any animal to take it off its own property without the means to properly and immediately remove and dispose of the animal's feces from any public property. "Means to properly and immediately remove and dispose of the animal's feces" shall consist of having on one's person a device such as a plastic bag or other suitable "scooper," that can be used to fully clean up and contain the animal's waste until it can be deposited in a closed trash receptacle or other appropriate refuse container. Such a device must be produced and shown upon request to anyone authorized to enforce this ordinance. 
(3)  This provision shall not apply to a service animal accompanying a person with a disability or to an animal being used by law enforcement officers when doing so would prevent the officers from carrying out their official responsibilities. 
(4)  Animal waste, referred to as "manure" in the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority Ordinances, shall not be flushed down a toilet into the sanitary sewer system in accordance with that ordinance. 
(5)  "Public nuisance" is defined to include "any animal which deposits feces on public property when the person owning, possessing, harboring or having the care, charge, control, or custody of the animal fails to remove the feces so deposited. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-93, § 1, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 12-29. - Debris in stormwater drainage system. 
(a)  Findings. Yard waste such as leaves, grass clippings, and soil/sediment can cause significant water quality problems when it is blown or directed into the stormwater system. Water quality problems include algal blooms and aquatic weed growth, oxygen depletion, fish kills, and impaired aquatic habitat. In addition, when the stormwater system is clogged with yard waste it can cause street and property flooding. 
(b)  Restrictions on debris. 
(1)  It shall be unlawful for any person to rake, sweep, blow, wash, direct or place any debris, including but not limited to yard waste, grass clippings, leaves, sediment, trash, or debris of any kind into the storm drainage system of the city, including any streets, storm drains, ditches, swales, streams, lakes, culverts, rights-of-way, dedicated easements, or in any other area where it might impede the flow of water through the storm drainage system of the city. 
(2)  It shall be the duty of all property owners within the city to take adequate precautions on their property to ensure positive drainage on their property. Such drainage may be provided either through natural or artificial drains found to be adequate by the city engineer. The owner shall keep all ditches, drains, swales, and drainage routes free from obstructions which would impede the flow of water. 
(3)  When it shall appear to the city manager that drainage facilities or drainageways on any private property are, for any reason, inadequate and prior notice has not resulted in correction of problem conditions, he shall notify the owner of the property by registered or certified mail what corrective measures are required to render the drainage adequate. The notice to the owner shall specify a reasonable time within which the corrective measures should be taken. Notice to the owner whose address is unknown shall be given to the person in whose name the property is listed for taxation at the address shown on the tax records or to the agent of the owner whose name appears upon the tax records. 
(4)  If such corrective measures are not taken as required in the notice to the owner, the city manager, upon approval by the city council, may enter upon such premises and take the corrective measures required and the city council may assess the cost thereof against the owner of the property and such assessment shall become a lien on the property with the same prorating to be collected as unpaid ad valorem taxes. 
(5)  Any condition in violation of this section shall constitute a public nuisance, subject to abatement as set forth in article II of chapter 10 of the City Code. 
(6)  The following are preferred best management practices (BMPs) for yard waste and debris: 
a.  Prevent yard waste and debris from entering the street, storm drain, ditch, or other parts of the drainage system. 
b.  Direct or blow yard waste back onto a lawn or landscape area. 
c.  Sweep, rake, and/or collect yard waste instead hosing/sweeping off of driveways, sidewalks or other impervious surfaces. 
d.  Leave grass clippings on the lawn to decompose quickly and act as a natural fertilizer and soil conditioner ("grass cycle"). 
e.  Compost yard debris for use in the lawn, garden, or landscape. 
f.  Collect and contain yard waste for city collection service according to specific yard waste collection policies. Do not use the city trash cart for yard waste or debris. 
g.  Collect and dispose of waste at a legally authorized yard waste collection facility.

Sec. 16-231. - Order-Contents. 
    After notice and a hearing as provided for in this article, the hearing officer shall state in writing his determination whether such dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation and, if so, whether it is deteriorated or dilapidated. 
(1)  If the hearing officer determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is deteriorated, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter and improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this chapter within a specified period of time. 
(2)  If the hearing officer determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is dilapidated, he shall state in writing his findings of fact to support such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to either repair, alter and improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this chapter or to remove or demolish the same within a specified period of time. However, notwithstanding any other provision of law or this article, if such dwelling is located in one (1) of the historic districts of the city and the historic district commission determines, after a public hearing as provided by ordinance, that the dwelling is of particular significance or value toward maintaining the character of the district, and such dwelling has not been condemned as unsafe, the order may require that such dwelling be vacated and closed. Nothing herein shall affect the operation of section 19-134 of this Code with respect to such dwellings. 
(3)  In connection with an order issued under either (1) or (2) above, the hearing officer may direct that the dwelling be vacated and closed until it has been altered, repaired, improved or demolished as directed by such order. 
(4)  Orders issued pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) above may be repealed as provided in division 3 of this article. 
(Code 1962, § 6-62; Ord. of 1-5-93, § 1; Ord. of 10-4-94, § 1) 
Sec. 16-232. - Same-Failure to comply. 
(a)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter or improve the dwelling, the housing inspector may cause such dwelling to be repaired, altered or improved. 
(b)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the dwelling, the housing inspector may cause such dwelling to be removed or demolished. 
(c)  In connection with the exercise of the powers set forth in subsections (a) and (b), the housing inspector may cause such dwelling to be vacated and closed and may cause to be posted on the main entrance of any dwelling so closed a placard with the following words: This building is unfit for human habitation; the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited and unlawful. 
(d)  The duties of the housing inspector set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c) shall not be exercised until the city council, by ordinance, shall have ordered the housing inspector to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this article with respect to the particular property or properties which the hearing officer shall have found to be unfit for human habitation and which property or properties shall be described in the ordinance. No such ordinance shall be adopted to require demolition of a dwelling unless the owner has first been given a reasonable opportunity to bring it into conformity with the housing code, and the council has specifically so found. The reasonable time herein prescribed may include or consist of the time allowed in the housing inspector's order issued pursuant to section 16-231. Such ordinances shall be recorded in the office of the New Hanover County Register of Deeds and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. 
(e)  The amount of the cost of such repairs, alterations or improvements, or vacating and closing, or demolition and removal by the housing inspector shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred, which lien shall be filed, have the same priority and be collected as provided in G.S. § 160A-216 et seq. If the dwelling is demolished and removed by the housing inspector, he shall sell the materials of such dwelling and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the demolition and removal and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court by the housing inspector, shall be secured in such manner as may be directed by such court, and shall be disbursed by such court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of such court (in a special proceeding brought before the clerk of superior court for said purpose).

Vacating and closing dwellings pursuant to such an ordinance shall be done under the supervision of the housing inspector. 
(g)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise, nor shall enforcement of one (1) remedy provided herein prevent the enforcement of the other remedies provided herein.

State Law reference- Authority for above section, G.S. § 160A-443; abatement of health and safety nuisances, G.S. § 160A-193. 
Sec. 16-233. - Remedies. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dwelling to fail, neglect or refuse to repair, alter or improve the same or to vacate, close, demolish and remove the same, upon order of the hearing officer duly made and served as provided in this article, within the time specified in such order. 
(b)  When the hearing officer finds that a dwelling is unfit for human habitation or dangerous within the meaning of this article and has notified the owner to such effect, and the time limit set by the officer for the correction of defects or vacating same has expired, no person shall receive rentals, offer for rent or occupy such building unfit as a human habitation. 
(c)  If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling, the housing inspector may cause a civil action to be filed in the name of the city to remove such occupant. The action to vacate the dwelling shall be in the nature of summary ejectment and shall be commenced by filing a complaint naming as parties-defendant any person occupying such dwelling. The clerk of superior court shall issue a summons requiring the defendant to appear before a magistrate at a certain time, date and place not to exceed ten (10) days from the issuance of the summons to answer the complaint. The summons and complaint shall be served as provided in G.S. § 42-29. The summons shall be returned according to its tenor, and if on its return it appears to have been duly served, and if at the hearing the housing inspector produces a certified copy of an ordinance adopted by the governing body pursuant to section 16-232(d) authorizing the officer to proceed to vacate the occupied dwelling, the magistrate shall enter judgment ordering that the premises be vacated and that all persons be removed. The judgment ordering that the dwelling be vacated shall be enforced in the same manner as the judgment for summary ejectment entered under G.S. § 42-30. An appeal from any judgment entered hereunder by the magistrate may be taken as provided in G.S. § 7A-228, and the execution of such judgment may be stayed as provided in G.S. § 7A-227. An action to remove an occupant of a dwelling who is a tenant of the owner may not be in the nature of a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant to this paragraph unless such occupant was served with notice at least thirty (30) days before the filing of the summary ejectment proceeding that the governing body has ordered the housing inspector to proceed to exercise his duties under section 16-232(a), (b) and (c) to vacate and close or remove and demolish the dwelling. 
(d)  That whenever a determination is made pursuant to section 16-231 that a dwelling must be vacated and closed or removed or demolished under the provisions of this section, notice of the order shall be given by first class mail to any organization involved in providing or restoring dwellings for affordable housing that has filed a written request for such notices. A minimum period of forty-five (45) days from the mailing of such notice shall be given before removal or demolition by action of the housing inspector to allow the opportunity for any organization to negotiate with the owner to make repairs, lease, or purchase the property for the purpose of providing affordable housing. 
The housing inspector or clerk shall certify the mailing of the notices, and the certification shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. Only an organization that has filed a written request for such notices may raise the issue of failure to mail such notices, and the sole remedy shall be an order requiring the housing inspector to wait forty-five (45) days before causing removal or demolition. 
(Code 1962, § 6-64; Ord. of 10-4-94, § 1) 
Sec. 16-234. - Service of complaints or orders. 
(a)  Complaints issued by the housing inspector or orders issued by a hearing officer under this article shall be served upon persons either personally or by registered or certified mail. When service is made by registered or certified mail, a copy of the complaint or order may also be sent by regular mail. Service shall be deemed sufficient if the registered or certified mail is unclaimed or refused, but the regular mail is not returned by the post office within ten (10) days after the mailing. If regular mail is used, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises affected. If the identities of any owners or the whereabouts of persons are unknown and cannot be ascertained by the housing inspector in the exercise of reasonable diligence, or, if the owners are known but have refused to accept service by registered or certified mail, and he shall make an affidavit to that effect, then the serving of such complaint or order upon such owners or other persons may be made by publishing the same at least once in a newspaper having general circulation in the city, and no later than the time at which personal service would be required under provisions of this article. When service is made by publication, a copy of such complaint or order shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises affected by the complaint or order. 
(b)  Failure on the part of any owner or party in interest to receive or have served upon him any complaint, notice or order herein provided for shall not affect or invalidate the proceedings with respect to any other owner or party in interest or any other person.

Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the hearing officer shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from a decision of the hearing officer refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a decision of the hearing officer requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the board, unless the hearing officer certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant), a suspension of his requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case the requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than one (1) day's written notice to the hearing officer, by the board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. 
(b)  The appeals board shall fix a reasonable time for hearing appeals, shall give due notice to the parties and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of the hearing officer, but the concurring vote of four (4) members of the board shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the housing inspector or the hearing officer. The board shall have the power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this article, to adapt the application hereof to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of this article shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. 
(c)  Every decision of the board shall be subject to review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within fifteen (15) days of the decision of the board, but not otherwise. 
(d)  Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the hearing officer or a decision rendered by the board may petition the superior court for an injunction restraining the hearing officer from carrying out the order or decision and the court may, upon such petition, issue a temporary injunction restraining the hearing officer pending a final disposition of the case. The petition shall be filed within thirty (30) days after issuance of the order or rendering of the decision. Hearings shall be held by the court on any such petition within twenty (20) days, and shall be given preference over other matters on the court's calendar. The court shall hear and determine the issues raised and shall enter such final order or decree as law and justice may require. It shall not be necessary to file bond in any amount before obtaining a temporary injunction under this subsection. 
(e)  In case any dwelling is erected, constructed, altered, repaired, converted, maintained or used in violation of this article or any valid order or decision of the hearing officer or board made pursuant to this article, the hearing officer or board may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration or use, to restrain, correct or abate such violation, to prevent the occupancy of the dwelling, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct or use in or about the premises of the dwelling.

Formerly, Chapter 18 pertained to similar subject matter as enacted by Ord. No. 0-2004-105, § 2(Exh. A), adopted Dec. 14, 2004, effective Jan. 15, 2005; as subsequently amended. 

ARTICLE 1. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 18-1. - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the "Land Development Code of the City of Wilmington, North Carolina." 
Sec. 18-2. - Authority. 
(a)  The City of Wilmington enacts this chapter pursuant to the authority granted by the General Statutes of North Carolina, including G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 19, and Article XXIII of the Wilmington City Charter. 
(b)  Whenever any provision of this chapter refers to or cites a section of the North Carolina General Statutes or the Wilmington City Charter and that section is later amended or superseded, this chapter shall be deemed amended to refer to the amended section or the section that most nearly corresponds to the superseded section. 
(c)  It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way to impair or interfere with any existing provisions of law or ordinance, other than the ordinances superseded by this chapter, or any rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued, or which shall be adopted or issued, in conformity with law, relating to the use of buildings or premises, nor is it intended by this chapter to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or other agreements between parties; provided, however, that where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or premises or upon the height of buildings or requires large yards, courts, or other open spaces than are imposed or required by such existing provisions of law or ordinance or by such rules, regulations or permits, or by such easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions of this chapter shall control. 
(d)  All suits at law or in equity and/or all prosecutions resulting from violations of any zoning, subdivision, sign, floodplain or other ordinances heretofore in effect, which are now pending in any of the courts of the United States or this state shall not be abated or abandoned by reason of the adoption of this chapter, but shall be prosecuted to their finality the same as if this chapter had not been adopted; any and all violations of the existing ordinances, prosecutions for which have not been instituted, may be hereafter filed and prosecuted pursuant to the terms and provisions of this chapter; and nothing in this chapter shall be construed to abandon, abate or dismiss any litigation or prosecution now pending, and/or which heretofore have been instituted or prosecuted. 
(e)  To the extent that the provisions of this chapter are the same in substance as the previously adopted provisions that they replace, they shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new adoptions, enactments or amendments unless otherwise specifically provided. In particular, a situation that did not constitute a lawful, nonconforming situation under the previously adopted zoning ordinance does not achieve lawful nonconforming status under this chapter merely by the repeal of the zoning ordinance. When provisions of this chapter refer to the date of adoption or effective date, such date shall mean the date of the original adoption or original effective date of the provision or the date the provision became applicable to an area as a result of annexation or other change in jurisdiction of this chapter. 
(f)  The adoption of this chapter shall not extend the amortization period for any nonconforming situation under any previously adopted provisions. 
Sec. 18-3. - Jurisdiction. 
(a)  This chapter shall be effective throughout the corporate limits of the City of Wilmington, North Carolina, as now or hereafter fixed. 
(b)  All of the provisions of articles 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of this chapter shall apply to the erection, construction, and use of buildings and land by the State of North Carolina and its political subdivisions. No land owned by the State of North Carolina, however, may be included within a conditional zoning district without approval of the council of state or its designate. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Code to the contrary, the provisions of articles 4, 7, 8 (except division VII, buffer yards), 9, 10, 11, and 12 of this chapter shall not apply to the erection, construction, or use of buildings within the fenced and secured perimeter of the North Carolina State Port Authority's Port of Wilmington in an area located eight hundred (800) feet west of the mainline of the railroad track and south of Maritime Road; provided, however, the erection, construction, or use of buildings and land at the Port of Wilmington must comply with all applicable state requirements. 
(Ord. No. O-2015-21, § 1, 3-3-15) 
Sec. 18-4. - Purpose. 
    This chapter is intended to consolidate all of the city's major land development and land use regulations. 
    The regulations in this chapter are designed to promote efficient traffic circulation; to minimize the risk of fire, panic, and other damages; to protect public health, safety, and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; the protection of residential neighborhoods, shopping districts, parks and recreational facilities and natural resources from adverse impacts of inappropriate uses or site development features and to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, potable water, sanitary sewerage, schools, parks, and other public facilities. The regulations herein represent a reasonable consideration of the character of the city's various neighborhoods and their peculiar suitability for particular uses of land and have been made with a view to preserving the existing environment and maintaining or enhancing the quality of life while assuring the greatest possible use and enjoyment of land on individual properties, balanced against the necessary protection and enjoyment of land uses on adjacent properties, with the objective of promoting and protecting the public welfare through the regulation of land use and land development activities. 
Sec. 18-5. - Relationship to long-range plans. 
    It is the intention of the Wilmington City Council that this chapter implement the general planning policies expressed in the Wilmington-New Hanover County CAMA Land Use Plan, the city's comprehensive plan, corridor plans, special area plans and other planning documents as adopted by the city council and as subsequently amended. While the city council intends that this chapter and any amendment to it shall be in conformity with adopted planning policies, the council hereby expresses its intent that neither this chapter nor any amendment to it may be challenged on the basis of any alleged nonconformity with any planning document. 
(Ord. No. O-2016-35, § 1, 5-3-16) 
Sec. 18-6. - Fees. 
(a)  Reasonable fees sufficient to cover the costs of administration, inspection, publication of notice and similar matters may be charged to applicants for zoning permits, sign permits, special-use permits, subdivision preliminary plan review plat approvals, zoning amendments, tree removal and preservation permits, site plans, concept plans, historic preservation applications, zoning verifications, traffic impact analysis reviews, landscape plans, street closures, vested rights, annexations, variances and other administrative relief. The amount of the fees charged shall be as set forth in the city's fee schedule. 
(b)  Fees established in accordance with subsection (a) shall be paid upon submission of a signed application or notice of appeal. The application or notice shall not be complete until the fees are paid. City agencies, however, shall be exempt from the payment of fees under this section. 
(Ord. No. O-2010-91, § 2, 12-7-10; Ord. No. O-2016-35, § 2, 5-3-16) 
Sec. 18-7. - Computation of time. 
(a)  Unless otherwise specifically provided, the time within which an act is to be done shall be computed by excluding the first and including the last day. If the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, that day shall be excluded. When the period of time prescribed is less than seven (7) days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays shall be excluded. 
(b)  Unless otherwise specifically provided, whenever a person has the right or is required to do some act within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper upon him and the notice of paper is served by mail, three (3) days shall be added to the prescribed period. 
Sec. 18-8. - Public hearing notice. 
    Whenever a public hearing is required herein to be held by the city council in the performance of its powers and duties, notice of the public hearing shall be given once a week for two (2) successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the city prior to the date set for the public hearing. The first publication of such notice shall be made no less than ten (10) days nor more than twenty-five (25) days prior to said hearing. Within that same time period, whenever a public hearing is required herein to be held by the board of adjustment, the city shall prominently post a notice of the hearing on the site that is the subject of a board of adjustment hearing or on an adjacent street or highway right-of-way and mail to the person or entity whose appeal, application, or request is the subject of the hearing; to the owner of the property that is the subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing and to the owners of all parcels of land abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the board of adjustment hearing. These provisions shall not apply to hearings by the historic preservation commission, planning commission, and subdivision review board. 
(Ord. No. O-2013-64, § 1, 9-17-13) 
Sec. 18-9. - Requirements resulting in a fraction. 
    Except as otherwise provided by law, when any requirement of this chapter results in a fraction of a unit, a fraction of one-half (1/2) or more shall be considered a whole and a fraction of less than one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded. Rounding of numbers shall be done after computations are made. For example, in density computations, a three-acre site with an allowable density of four and four-tenths (4.4) units per acre nets thirteen (13) units (3 x 4.4 = 13.2) rather than twelve (12) units (3 x 4 = 12) by rounding the fractions after the computation is made. 
Sec. 18-10. - Interpretation. 
(a)  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. 
(b)  Only those permitted uses, uses permitted under prescribed conditions, and special uses indicated by the applicable district regulations shall be interpreted to be allowed in such district. No interpretation shall be effective to change the character of a district in comparison with the purpose of such district and the other uses allowed. 
(Ord. No. O-2010-91, § 3, 12-7-10) 
Sec. 18-11. - Severability. 
    Should any section or provision of this chapter or any boundary of any district of the official zoning map herein or hereafter adopted be decided by the courts to be unconstitutional or illegal, such decision shall not affect the validity of these regulations and the official zoning map as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so decided to be unconstitutional or illegal. 
Sec. 18-12. - Effective date. 
    The provisions of this chapter were adopted on December 14, 2004 and became effective on January 15, 2005.

DIVISION II. - BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT 

Sec. 18-26. - Establishment and procedure. 
    The Wilmington Board of Adjustment, herein called "board" is hereby established to fulfill the duties and powers prescribed to it by this article and the City Code and by G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 19, Pts. 3 and 6. 
(a)  The board shall consist of five (5) members and two (2) alternate members appointed by the Wilmington City Council. All members shall be appointed for staggered terms of three (3) years. Each alternate member, while attending any regular or special meeting of the board and serving in the absence of any regular member, shall have and may exercise all the powers and duties of a regular member. All appointments to fill vacancies shall be for the unexpired term. 
(b)  The board shall adopt rules of procedure for the conduct of its affairs and in keeping with the provisions of this article. Such rules of procedure shall not be effective until approved by the city council. All meetings held by the board shall be held in accordance with the North Carolina Open Meetings Law. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings suitable for review in court showing: 
(1)  The factual evidence presented to the board by all parties concerned; 
(2)  The findings of fact and the reasons for the determinations by the board; 
(3)  The vote of each member, or if absent or failing to vote indicating such fact, all of which shall be public record and be filed with the secretary to the board. 
Sec. 18-27. - Appeals to the board of adjustment. 
    Appeals to the board concerning interpretation or administration of this chapter by the city manager may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, commission or board of the city. Such appeal may be taken by filing a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof with the city clerk within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days after receiving active or constructive notice of the decision. Upon proper filing of an appeal, the official who made the decision shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers then constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken as provided in the rules of procedure. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner. The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of appeal, give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. At the hearing, any person may appear in person or by agent or attorney. 
(Ord. No. O-2008-87, § 1, 11-5-08; Ord. No. O-2013-64, § 2, 9-17-13) 
Sec. 18-28. - Stay of proceedings. 
    An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement of the action appealed from, unless the official who made the decision certifies to the board of adjustment after notice of appeal has been filed that because of facts stated in an affidavit stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the ordinance. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the official for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the board of adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within fifteen (15) days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the ordinance shall not stay the further review of an application for permits or to use such property; in these situations, the appellant may request, and the board may grant, a stay of a final decision of permit applications or building permits affected by the issue being appealed. 
(Ord. No. O-2013-64, § 3, 9-17-13) 
Sec. 18-29. - Powers and duties. 
(a)  Administrative review. The board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from and review any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the city manager charged with the enforcement of this chapter. 
(b)  Variances. The board of adjustment is authorized to issue variances from the dimensional requirements of this chapter such that they will not be contrary to the public interest, to the spirit of this chapter and where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary physical but not economic hardship. Dimensional requirements are limited to height, area and size of structure or size of yards and open spaces. Establishment or expansion of a use otherwise prohibited shall not be allowed by variance, nor shall a variance be granted because of the presence of nonconformities in the zoning district or uses in an adjoining zoning district. In granting any variance, the board of adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. The hereafter described procedures shall be followed to grant a variance from the terms of this chapter: 
(1)  A written application for variance is submitted demonstrating: 
a.  Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property; 
b.  The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public may not be the basis for granting a variance; 
c.  The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship; 
d.  The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved. 
(2)  A public hearing shall be held on the variance. Any person may appear at said hearing, in person or by agent or attorney. 
(3)  The board of adjustment in granting a variance shall make findings of fact that the requirements of subsection (b)(1) above have been met by the applicant and that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure. No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance. 
(4)  In denying a variance, the board of adjustment shall make findings of fact that one (1) or more of the requirements in subsection (b)(1) above do not exist. 
(5)  The findings of fact made by the board of adjustment under this subsection shall be based on evidence presented at the hearing at which the variance is considered. 
(6)  Any order or decision of the board of adjustment granting a variance shall expire if a building permit for the affected use is not obtained by the applicant within twenty-four (24) months from the date the decision is filed in the planning division office or any successor office. One (1) extension of time for the variance, not to exceed twelve (12) months, may be granted by the board of adjustment provided an application for such extension is submitted in writing prior to the expiration of the variance. 
(c)  Ruling. In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have the power of the administrative official from whom the appeal is taken, so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this chapter. Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance. Any other ordinance that regulates land use or development may provide for variances consistent with the provisions of this chapter. 
(d)  Voting. The concurring vote of four-fifths ( 4/5 ) of the board shall be necessary to grant a variance. A majority of the members shall be required to decide any other quasi-judicial matter or to determine an appeal made in the nature of certiorari. For the purposes of this subsection, vacant positions on the board and members who are disqualified from voting on the quasi-judicial matter shall not be considered members of the board for calculation of the requisite majority if there are no qualified alternates available to take the place of such members.

Sec. 18-30. - Appeals from the board of adjustment. 
    Every quasi-judicial decision shall be subject to review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari pursuant to G.S. 160A-393. A petition for review shall be filed with the clerk of superior court by the later of thirty (30) days after the decision is effective or after a written copy thereof is given in accordance with this chapter. A quasi-judicial decision is effective upon filing the written decision with the clerk to the board or such other office of official as the ordinance specifies. The decision of the board shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail to the applicant, property owner, and to any person who has submitted a written request for a copy, prior to the date the decision becomes effective. When first-class mail is used to deliver notice, three (3) days shall be added to the time to file the petition. The person required to provide notice shall certify that proper notice has been made.

DIVISION IV. - SPECIAL USE PERMIT APPROVAL PROCESS 

Sec. 18-79. - Purpose. 
    Special use permits add flexibility to the zoning ordinance. Subject to high standards of planning and design, certain property uses may be allowed in several districts where these uses would not otherwise be acceptable. By means of controls exercised through the special use permit procedures, property uses which would otherwise be undesirable in certain districts can be developed to minimize any adverse effects they might have on surrounding properties. 
Sec. 18-80. - General. 
    Special use permits may be issued by the city council for those uses of land and buildings requiring a special use permit as listed in each zoning district classification. Special use permits may be granted by the city council after a public hearing. 
(Ord. No. O-2019-15, § 1, 4-2-19)

(b)  The city council may change the existing zoning classification of the area covered by a petition, or any part or parts thereof, to the classification requested or to a higher classification or classifications without the necessity of withdrawal or modification of the petition; provided, however, notices of hearings on such amendments shall inform the public that such action may be taken. 
Sec. 18-118. - Petition for a change. 
    The following action shall be taken by the applicant: 
(a)  Initiation of amendments. Proposed amendments may be initiated by the city council, planning commission, board of adjustment, or by one (1) or more interested parties. 
(b)  Application. An application for any amendment shall contain a description of the proposed regulation or zoning district boundary to be applied. Such application shall be filed with the secretary of the planning commission no later than thirty (30) working days prior to the planning commission meeting at which the application is to be considered, except Land Development Code regulatory amendments, which shall follow subsection (g) below.

For purposes of this chapter, two (2) days shall mean at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the date of the hearing. The hours prior to the time of the hearing on the scheduled date of the hearing shall not be added to the requisite forty-eight (48) hours to determine if such protest petition has been filed on time. "Legal holidays" shall mean all those days set forth in G.S. § 103-4 and shall also include all approved state, county or city holidays since some of the required public records to determine the sufficiency of a petition may be unavailable for inspection due to office closings on these days. To be considered, a petition shall be complete in all respects at the time of filing and no additions, corrections, revisions or other amendments shall be allowed subsequent to the filing deadline. The filing deadline shall be the designated time at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the properly advertised date of the first scheduled public hearing and any tabling, continuance, postponement or other delay does not extend the filing deadline.

ARTICLE 4. - NONCONFORMITIES AND VESTED RIGHTS 
DIVISION I. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 18-139. - General. 
    After the effective date of this chapter, land or structures, or the lawful uses of land or structures which would be prohibited under this chapter and which were lawfully existing prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be considered as nonconforming. It is the intent of this article to permit these nonconformities to continue, but not to encourage their perpetual use. Except as otherwise provided herein, nonconforming structures or uses may be continued provided they conform to the provisions of this article. 
Sec. 18-140. - Use of undeveloped nonconforming lots. 
(a)  Nonconforming single lot of record. A vacant lot of record established prior to the effective date of this chapter which does not conform to the district in which it is located may be used as a building site for a use permitted within that district provided that all construction and the location of the building shall be in accordance with the applicable front, side and rear yard requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. 
(b)  Nonconforming contiguous lots of record. If two (2) or more contiguous vacant lots of record established prior to the effective date of this chapter are in single ownership, such lots, at the owner's option, may be designated to form a single or several lots which meet the minimum front, side and rear yard requirements of the zoning district in which they are located. 
Sec. 18-141. - Completion of nonconforming projects. 
    The construction or erection of any nonconforming project may be completed provided all construction is done pursuant to a valid building permit. 
Sec. 18-142. - Extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations. 
(a)  Except as specifically provided in this section, it shall be unlawful for any person to engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation. 
(b)  Subject to subsection 18-142(d) of this article, a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this chapter, was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such uses. However, subject to section 18-141 of this chapter, a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building. 
(c)  Subject to section 18-141 of this chapter, a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming. Uses that involve the removal of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a quarry) may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming, if ten (10) percent or more of the earth products had already been removed on the effective date of this chapter. 
(d)  Where a nonconforming situation exists the equipment or process may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in degree of activity rather than changes in kind of activity and no violations of other provisions in this chapter occur. 
(e)  Physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land are unlawful if they result in: 
(1)  An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use; or 
(2)  Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as yard requirements, height limitations or density requirements; 
(3)  Greater nonconformity with respect to the exterior architectural features of the conforming structures in the part of the zoning district in which the nonconforming structure is located. 
(f)  Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged. 
(g)  Notwithstanding subsection 18-142(e), any structure used for single-family residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use or structure may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to yard size and setback requirements. For the purposes of this chapter, manufactured housing may be replaced with larger manufactured housing, and "single-wide" manufactured housing may be replaced with a "double-wide." This paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in section 18-144, abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations. 
(h)  Except for on-premises and outdoor advertising signs, a structure that is nonconforming in any respect or a structure that is used in a nonconforming manner may be reconstructed or replaced if partially or totally destroyed by fire, act of God or other accidental casualty loss, subject to the following restrictions: 
(1)  A letter of intent to reconstruct is received by the building inspector within six (6) months from the time of destruction. 
(2)  A building permit is obtained from the building inspector within one (1) year from the time the damage or destruction took place. 
(3)  The total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use may not be increased, except as provided in subsection 18-142(g) above. 
(4)  The reconstructed building may not be more nonconforming with respect to dimensional restrictions such as yard requirements, height limitations or density requirements, and such dimensional nonconformities must be eliminated if that can reasonably be accomplished without unduly burdening the reconstruction process or limiting the right to continue the nonconforming use of such building. 
(5)  The reconstructed building may not be more nonconforming with respect to exterior architectural features than the previous building (e.g., if a nonconforming commercial use was occurring in a building exhibiting residential exterior architectural features, any reconstruction to that building must retain those residential architectural features). Such exterior architectural feature nonconformities must be eliminated if they can be reasonably accomplished without unduly burdening the reconstruction process or limiting the right to continue the nonconforming use of such building. 
(i)  A nonconforming on-premises or outdoor advertising sign shall be subject to all requirements of this chapter regarding safety, maintenance, and repair. However, if the sign suffers substantial damage, the sign shall be brought into compliance with this chapter or removed. 
(j)  Notwithstanding subsection 18-142(e), any principal structure within the 1945 corporate limits maintained as a conforming use, may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to yard size and setback requirements. This provision shall not apply if the nonconforming setback abuts a residential use or district. 
(Ord. No. O-2012-24, § 1, 6-5-12) 
Sec. 18-143. - Change in kind of nonconforming use. 
(a)  A nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use. Thereafter, the property may not revert to a nonconforming use except as provided herein. 
(b)  A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use only in accordance with a special use permit issued by the city council. The city council may issue such special use permit if it finds that the proposed use will be no less compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the approval is applied for. If a nonconforming use is changed to any use other than a conforming use without obtaining city council approval pursuant to this paragraph, that change shall constitute a discontinuance of the nonconforming use, with consequences as stated in section 18-144. A nonconforming accessory use or building may only be changed to another nonconforming accessory use or building as provided in this section. Changes in a principal use are also considered as changes to any accessory use or building. The city council shall comply with the provisions of Article 3, Division IV of this chapter in issuing special use permits pursuant to this section. The city council may issue such special use permit if it finds that all five (5) of the following factors exist: 
(1)  That the proposed use will be no less compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the approval is applied for; 
(2)  That the use will not materially endanger the public health or safety if located where proposed and developed according to the plan as submitted and approved by the issuance of the special use permit; 
(3)  That the use meets all required conditions and specifications; 
(4)  That the use will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property, or that the use is a public necessity; and 
(5)  That the location and character of the use if developed according to the plan as submitted and approved will be in harmony with the area in which it is to be located and in general conformity with the city's comprehensive plan, the CAMA plan, and adopted special area plans (i.e., corridor plans, neighborhood plans, Wilmington Vision 2020: A Waterfront Downtown Plan). 
(c)  If a nonconforming use and a conforming use, any combination of conforming and nonconforming uses, or any combination of nonconforming uses exist on one (1) lot, the use made of the property may be changed substantially (except to a conforming use) only in accordance with a special use permit issued by the city council. The city council shall issue such special use permit if it finds that the proposed use will be no less compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use or combination of uses in operation at the time the special use permit is applied for. Subsection 18-88(c) shall apply to special use permits issued by the city council pursuant to this section. 
(d)  An application for city council approval pursuant to this section may be made up to one hundred eighty (180) days following abandonment or discontinuance of the previous nonconforming use, provided: 
(1)  That the premises has not been used for a conforming purpose at any time following the discontinuance of the previous nonconforming use; and 
(2)  That this subsection shall not be construed as extending the period specified in subsection 18-144(a). 
(Ord. No. O-2008-25, 4-8-08; Ord. No. O-2010-50, 6-15-10; Ord. No. O-2010-91, § 10, 12-7-10; Ord. No. O-2016-35, § 6, 5-3-16) 
Sec. 18-144. - Abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations. 
(a)  When a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty (180) days, the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes, except for those structures qualifying under subsection 18-142(h). 
(b)  For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one (1) apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one (1) space in a nonconforming manufactured housing park for one hundred eighty (180) days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building or manufactured housing park as a whole is continuously maintained. 
    If a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for one hundred eighty (180) days shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. For example, if manufactured housing is used as a nonconforming use on the residential lot where a conforming residential structure also is located, removal of that manufactured housing for one hundred eighty (180) days terminates the right to replace it. 
(c)  When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this chapter is vacant or discontinued on the effective date of this chapter, the one hundred eighty-day period, for purposes of this section, begins on the effective date of this chapter. 
Sec. 18-145. - Nonconformities created by public action. 
    When lot area or setbacks are reduced as a result of conveyance to a federal, state or local government for a public purpose and the remaining area is at least seventy-five (75) percent of the required minimum dimensional standard for the district in which it is located, then that lot shall be deemed in compliance with the minimum lot size and setback standards of this ordinance without the need to obtain a variance from the board of adjustment for new development or existing structures made nonconforming as a result of the conveyance.

(b)  The approval authority may approve a site specific development plan upon such terms and conditions as may be reasonably necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Such conditional approval shall result in a vested right being established; provided, that failure to satisfy any of the terms and conditions so imposed will result in a forfeiture of vested rights. 
(c)  A site specific development plan shall be deemed approved as of the effective date of the approval authority's final action or adoption of an ordinance relating thereto.

(c)  The establishment of a vested right pursuant to this division shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning that imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land use regulation by the city, including but not limited to: building, fire, plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes. New and amended zoning regulations that would be applicable to certain property but for the establishment of a vested right with respect thereto shall become effective upon the expiration or termination of the vested right in accordance with this division. 
(d)  Upon issuance of a building permit, the expiration provisions of G.S. § 160A-418 and the revocation provisions of G.S. § 160A-422 shall apply, except that a building permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the running of time while a zoning vested right under this section is outstanding. 
Sec. 18-158. - Termination of vested rights. 
    A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this division shall terminate: 
(a)  At the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed; 
(b)  Upon written request or with the written consent of the affected landowner; 
(c)  Upon findings by the city council, by ordinance after notice and a public hearing, that natural or manmade hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the site specific development plan; 
(d)  Upon payment to the affected landowner of compensation for all costs, expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other consultant's fees incurred after approval by the city, together with interest thereon at the legal rate until paid. Compensation shall not include any diminution in the value of the property which is caused by such action; 
(e)  Upon findings by the city council, by ordinance after notice and a hearing, that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations which made a difference in the approval by the approval authority of the site specific development plan; or 
(f)  Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the site specific development plan, in which case the approval authority may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in state or federal law has a fundamental effect on the plan, by ordinance after notice and a hearing. 
Sec. 18-159. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  A vested right, once established as provided for in this division, precludes any zoning action by the city which would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as set forth in an approved site specific development plan. 
(b)  Nothing in this division shall prohibit the revocation of the original approval or other remedies for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions of the approval or the zoning ordinance.

DIVISION II. - DISTRICT REGULATIONS 

Sec. 18-173. - Introduction. 
    This division contains the specific use and area regulations for each zoning district found in the city. The material has been divided into the following sections:

(f)  Development standards. The dimensional standards, buffering requirements and other design standards for each district. The use of separate sections to describe the various provisions for each district does not relieve any person from complying with all the requirements for the same district. 
(g)  Interpretation of permitted uses. Because the list of permissible uses set forth in this article cannot be all inclusive, those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, all uses that are not listed in this article, even given the liberal interpretation mandated by this subsection, are prohibited. This article shall not be interpreted to allow a use in one (1) zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in other zoning districts. If a specific use is listed in one (1) of the base zoning districts listed in section 18-164 (excluding the MX District), it shall be excluded from the general use categories of business services, personal services, professional services, residential, and retail sales establishments. 
Sec. 18-174. - Exceptions to area and height standards. 
(a)  In general. The following requirements or regulations qualify or supplement, as the case may be, the district regulations or requirements appearing elsewhere in this chapter.

If no typical yard setback exists in this situation, then setbacks shall equal the average front, rear or side yard setbacks respectively for that block face on the same side of the street so long as the requirements of section 18-556 are observed. 
(7)  No structure in any district shall be erected that exceeds the maximum height permissible under the New Hanover County airport height zoning ordinance and the Federal Air Regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration. 
(b)  Zero lot line development. For properties in R-5, R-3, Multifamily Residential, O&I-1, O&I-2, CB, RB, and CS Districts, zero (0) lot line development shall be permitted in accordance with the following standards.

No specific minimum standards related to radii, vertical curves and longitudinal grades will be stated except that such designs will ensure safe, convenient access and circulation for emergency and service vehicles. It will be an objective in the design and review of private streets and parking areas to provide for a residential environment where access and circulation ways are configured for slow speeds and to do minimum disturbance to topography and tree cover. 
(5)  Angled parking areas directly adjoining private streets will be permitted on one (1) side of the street. Such parking areas may be alternated from one (1) side of the street to the other. The combined length of such parking areas may not exceed fifty (50) percent of the length of the adjoining roadway. All other angled parking areas must be clearly separated from the private street by at least a barrier island. 
(6)  Permanent street names approved by the city manager or designee will be assigned to each private street. Street name signs approved by the appropriate city department must be posted. The assignment of building identification numbers will utilize the approved private street names. 
(7)  Private streets and surface parking areas on the site will be no closer than fifteen (15) feet to any side of a residential building used for entry into the building and will be no closer than five (5) feet to any other face of a building. Architectural features such as stairs, chimneys, bay windows, and roof overhangs may extend into this fifteen-foot area, but in no case may they be closer than five (5) feet to the private street and surface parking area. 
(8)  Building wall areas over two hundred (200) square feet and facing the public right-of way shall require a minimum of one (1) large maturing tree per thirty (30) feet of linear wall or one (1) small maturing tree per twenty (20) feet of linear wall no closer than fifteen (15) feet to the wall. 
(9)  All locations for recycling containers, solid waste handling areas, dumpsters and/or compactors and their serviced entrances as required shall be shown on site plans for their review and approval. 
(10)  No building permit for construction of a multifamily or attached development that meets the definition of a subdivision as provided under this chapter will be issued until a preliminary plan has been approved in accordance with the subdivision regulations. After the subdivision review board has approved the preliminary plan, the multifamily or attached development must proceed through the normal approval process to obtain a building permit. Developments that meet the definition of a minor subdivision as provided under this chapter may be approved as minor plans and may not require review by the subdivision review board. 
(11)  All new multifamily developments shall provide open space that is equivalent to a minimum of thirty-five (35) percent of the size of the tract. In calculating the required amount of open space for the proposed multifamily development, the area of the property associated with natural ponds, stormwater ponds, lakes, ponds, rivers, streams and marshes shall first be subtracted from the gross area of land to be committed to the development. Half (17.5%) of the overall open space shall be either active or passive recreation areas. The remaining half (17.5%) may be active or passive recreation areas, or open space. The required open space and recreation space shall meet the standards as defined in Article 7 of this chapter. 
(12)  Front and corner side setbacks for new construction shall not apply to existing public or private streets so long as the following criteria are met: 
a.  The street is not zoned R-20, R-15, R-10, R-7, R-5 or R-3; 
b.  Buildings must have an entrance from the sidewalk; and 
c.  HVAC equipment, air conditioning window units, electrical equipment, fire escapes, solid waste facilities and other utility equipment shall not be located along facades with street frontage; and

Sec. 18-185. - MX, Mixed Use District. 
(a)  Purpose. The Mixed Use District (MX) is established, consistent with the policies of the comprehensive plan, to provide innovative opportunities for integrating diverse but compatible uses into a single development that is unified by distinguishable design features. The Mixed Use District is intended to provide an alternative to the predominant development pattern in Wilmington characterized by unconnected, uncoordinated commercial development along thoroughfares and limited access residential developments isolated from places to work and shop. MX may also be used to replicate the historic urban development pattern in redevelopment areas. In addition to a mixture of compatible uses, developments in this district shall provide amenities and walkways to increase pedestrian activity, decrease reliance on individual vehicles, foster transit usage, enhance the environmental quality and attractiveness of Wilmington and New Hanover County, improve the overall quality of life, and provide for the welfare of the citizens. In the event of conflict between regulations for mixed use developments and those in other sections of the City Code, the mixed use regulations shall supersede unless specifically stated otherwise. 
(b)  Mixture of uses. 
(1)  Uses may be mixed within a building or within the development. 
(2)  Mixed use developments on sites greater than fifteen (15) acres shall contain a minimum twenty (20) percent residential use. 
(3)  No more than seventy-five (75) percent of the required residential component may be located in a single-family detached residential development. 
(4)  The mixed use development must always contain at least three (3) of the following use categories: 
a.  Residential. 
b.  Office. 
c.  Commercial. 
d.  Institutional, quasi-public, public. 
e.  Entertainment and lodging. 
(5)  For mixed-use developments containing three (3) use categories, each use shall occupy a minimum of twenty (20) percent of the floor area or gross acreage of the project. The developer may choose the use mix measurement but each project shall only use one (1) of the use mix measurements (floor area or gross acreage). For projects with four (4) or more use categories, the twenty (20) percent minimum is waived for all categories except residential, however, no use may occupy more than sixty (60) percent and no two (2) uses combined shall occupy more than eighty (80) percent of the floor area or gross acreage. For phased projects, during construction of any phase prior to project completion or six (6) years from the initial foundation inspection, whichever is first, no single use shall exceed sixty (60) percent and no two (2) uses shall exceed ninety (90) percent. Residential uses may occupy as much as seventy-five (75) percent floor area or gross acreage, if that which is over sixty (60) percent is located in a mixed-use building and located over first floor commercial use. 
(6)  For MX projects developed in phases (as defined in this chpater), each phase shall be able to function as a stand alone development and the project shall contain the required common space/open space at all times during the phases of construction. All MX projects shall meet the minimum mix of uses requirements according to the following schedule: 
Project Size 
(acres zoned MX) Time from first foundation inspection to provide initial 60-30-10 mix 0-100 18 months 100+ to 200 36 months 200+ 48 months  
If the mix of uses is not provided in this time, no certificates of occupancy will be issued for any part of the project other than single-family detached residential developments and townhouse residential developments, not exceeding four (4) units per building until the mix is provided. All structures with a certificate of occupancy or at least foundations and footings may be considered part of the mix. Single-family detached residential developments and townhouse residential developments not exceeding four (4) units per building in MX projects of one hundred (100) acres or more may have up to four (4) years from the first foundation inspection approval before certificates of occupancy will be withheld for failure to provide the required mix of uses. The city council may grant a one-year extension for a total of five (5) years if the property owner can provide evidence that a mix will be provided by the end of the additional year. The evidence may include but is not limited to tenant contracts, leases or other legal construction agreements with specific deadlines. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions regarding the initial 60-30-10 mix and the 60-20-20 mix for phased projects, in the event that the developer has provided either the city or the North Carolina Department of Transportation, whichever is applicable, with financial guarantees in a form suitable to the relevant entity to cover all off-site improvements related to uses other than residential and twenty (20) percent of the project's common space/open space has been fully constructed and is accessible, then the developer's failure to provide the nonresidential component of the initial 60-30-10 mix, or the 60-20-20 mix for phased projects, within the applicable time periods set forth in the schedules above shall not preclude the issuance of certificates of occupancy for the residential portions of the project, provided all other conditions for obtaining the certificates have been met. 
(7)  Notwithstanding the foregoing and in lieu thereof, MX projects subject to an approved development agreement shall be subject to the phasing requirements as provided in such development agreement.

(1)  Minimum site size: The minimum gross tract size for initial zoning shall be five (5) contiguous acres. Contiguous additions may be made in increments of any size. Additions, when combined with any existing MX area, shall meet all ordinance requirements as a unified development. When the total MX site area exceeds fifteen (15) acres, the requirements for sites greater than fifteen (15) acres shall apply to the total MX site. 
(2)  Building height: No buildings shall exceed six (6) floors in height, including mezzanine levels. Floors for parking facilities shall not be included in the maximum height calculation. Additional height, up to ten (10) floors may be approved by the technical review committee if the project is granted density bonuses for low impact development. Buildings with height greater than six (6) floors should be located in the center of the site but may be permitted on site perimeters if the adjacent property has a building six (6) floors or greater. 
(3)  Thoroughfare requirements: All mixed-use developments on sites larger than fifteen (15) acres shall have at least one (1) direct access to and from an existing major or minor thoroughfare as indicated in the thoroughfare plan. Interconnection to other road classifications may be required. The city council may approve mixed-use developments without direct access to a thoroughfare if a traffic impact analysis, performed and approved according to the City Code, demonstrates: 
a.  The impact of the project will not cause surrounding roadways to operate above capacity. The city council shall consider the impact of undeveloped land in the area when approving mixed-use developments without access to thoroughfares; 
OR 
b.  The impact of the project will be less than or equal to the impact of a typical project developed under existing zoning. The typical project shall be determined by reviewing at least three (3) recent comparable projects developed within five (5) years of the project in the same zoning designation and shall not be a best case or worst case scenario. The list of comparable projects must be approved by city staff. 
(4)  Fringe use areas: To insure compatibility with adjoining land uses a fringe use area two hundred (200) feet in width, shall be established along the exterior property lines of the MX District where the exterior property lines of the MX District are adjacent to single-family residential uses or platted single-family residential lots. 
a.  If the exterior property line of the MX District is not adjacent to residential uses or platted residential lots, then no fringe use area will be required. 
b.  If a fringe use area is required, only residential uses or open space shall be permitted within that fringe area. 
c.  The maximum building height within the fringe use area shall be three (3) stories. 
d.  The required building setback in the fringe use area shall be calculated as follows: (building height) × (2.75). In no case shall the minimum setback be less than twenty-five (25) feet. 
e.  There shall be no accessory structures or parking located within the part of the setback adjacent to residential districts. 
f.  In all instances, lighting shall be directed away from the adjacent residential use. 
(5)  Building setbacks and separations: Buildings located on the periphery of the MX District shall be set back a minimum of twenty (20) feet from the MX District boundary. All buildings shall be set back at least fifty (50) feet from U.S. and North Carolina numbered highways and major thoroughfares. No building shall encroach upon the right-of-way of a proposed thoroughfare as designated by the Wilmington Area Thoroughfare Plan. There shall be no minimum interior setbacks and separation requirements. All internal nonresidential buildings are encouraged to be located within ten (10) feet of street rights-of-way to enhance the pedestrian orientation of the development. Buildings set back large distances from roads and pedestrian trails are strongly discouraged. However, all structures shall meet state building code requirements and all other requirements to protect the health, safety and welfare of occupants. 
(6)  Unified control/ownership of the site: Mixed-used developments shall be under single ownership or unified control or under the management and supervision of a central authority or otherwise subject to such supervisory lease or ownership control as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this ordinance. The entire MX site, including all phases and subdivided lots, shall be fully integrated through common design themes and pedestrian and vehicular connections. A unified mixed-use development is required regardless of whether the development is phased or subdivided. 
(7)  Community property owner's association: A community property owner's association shall be established in accordance with the subdivision ordinance. 
(8)  Underground utilities: All electric, cable television and telephone facilities, fire alarm conduits, street lighting wiring, and other wiring conduits and similar facilities shall be placed underground by the developer or the appropriate utility company. 
(9)  Minimum landscaping: All areas designated Mixed Use shall be subject to the landscaping regulations for the Office and Institutional (O&I) zoning district. Any individual, large retail buildings with a footprint of forty thousand (40,000) square feet or more shall be subject to the landscaping requirements for large-scale retail. Street trees are required along all streets and shall be a minimum three-inch caliper and shall be located at a minimum fifty (50) feet on center. The technical review committee (TRC) may permit alternatives to strict conformance with the required landscaping under the following conditions. In all cases, however, mixed-use developments shall provide at least the minimum square feet of landscaped area and number of trees required by this chapter. Only the location of required landscaping may vary. 
a.  Preservation of natural stands of trees and native vegetation. Preservation of natural stands of trees may be substituted for interior landscaping requirements when the square footage of the preserved area is at least equal to the minimum square footage required. Natural stands should be dispersed throughout the project if possible and shall not be permitted to replace all landscaping in a parking area. However, in no case shall perimeter landscaping be less than eight (8) feet in width. 
b.  Additional landscaping in key areas. Provision of at least ten (10) percent greater amount (square feet) than minimum landscaping area on the project perimeter, at project entrances and in common spaces may be substituted for strict conformance to internal landscaping requirements. 
c.  Provision of low impact developments. Landscaping necessary to accommodate the provision of low impact developments as described in the density bonus section may be substituted for strict conformance with minimum requirements.

(12)  Parking requirements: The following parking requirements shall apply to mixed-use developments: 
a.  Maximum parking requirements shall be consistent with the parking requirements of the City Code. Mixed-use developments shall be eligible for additional parking spaces above the maximum when utilizing the pervious parking requirements of the City Code. Any parking located above ground level in a parking facility shall not be counted towards the maximum. There shall be no minimum parking requirement. 
b.  A maximum twenty-five (25) percent of parking may be for small vehicles/compact cars subject to the standards of the City Code. 
(13)  General site design: The following characteristics are essential for a quality mixed-use development. Each of these components shall be included in mixed-use developments. Each component in this section includes both required and optional site design elements and is intended to allow for flexibility. The site plan shall include a narrative describing how the project will incorporate these characteristics. All mixed-use developments shall contain a minimum fifty (50) percent of the encouraged optional elements of this section. 
a.  Pedestrian accessibility/concentration of development (critical mass) in a compact, walkable area. 
i.  Uses are encouraged to be sufficiently concentrated to promote convenient pedestrian access. Larger projects are encouraged to concentrate uses in multiple nodes. Concentration within a one thousand five hundred (1,500) foot perimeter is preferred. 
ii.  Pedestrian circulation shall be clearly defined and shall connect all uses. 
iii.  Bicycle and pedestrian access to adjacent developments is strongly encouraged in areas where vehicular access is not provided. 
iv.  Sidewalks are required on each side of rights-of-way or private streets throughout the development and are encouraged to be located in front of businesses and houses and not concentrated in parking areas. 
v.  With the exception of exclusively single-family areas, separated, single use pods are prohibited. Strip commercial development characterized by single story uncoordinated, unconnected buildings with large street frontage parking lots is specifically prohibited. Strip malls with uncoordinated, unconnected out parcels are prohibited. All structures shall be fully integrated into the mixed-use project through common design themes (including, but not limited to, lighting, benches, landscaping, other decorative features but not necessarily building design), integration with a variety of uses, nonlinear arrangement, common spaces, pedestrian walkways, vehicular access connections and other features. 
b.  Clearly defined common spaces for gathering/interaction and fostering a sense of community. Plazas, courtyards and other areas are necessary to provide for public gathering and interaction. Amenities, such as benches, planters, lighting, fountains, art and landscaping that further the design theme of the project and encourage interaction are required. Specific requirements are described in the common space and open space section of this article. 
c.  Integrated design of the project. Common architectural theme: Mixed-use projects require special attention to building design because of the intermixing of land uses in close proximity. Functional integration of residential and commercial uses shall be considered during design of mixed-use projects. The following standards are intended to guide development of mixed-use projects: 
i.  Physical integration of uses: All mixed-use developments shall be designed and developed to provide an appropriate interrelationship between the various uses and structures within the development. 
ii.  Residential and commercial uses may be located within the same or adjoining structures providing appropriate health and safety regulations are followed. 
iii.  Design: Structures should provide architectural relief and interest, with emphasis at building entrances and along sidewalks, to promote and enhance a comfortable pedestrian scale and orientation. Structures shall have consistent scale and massing to create a unified project. Compatibility with the immediate context is required. However, gradual transitions in scale and massing are permitted. 
a.  Blank walls shall be avoided by including ground floor windows, recesses, extensions and breaks in roof elevation. 
b.  Design should provide differentiation between groundlevel spaces and upper stories. For example, bays or balconies for upper levels, and awnings, canopies or other similar treatments for lower levels can provide differentiation. Variation in building materials, trim, paint, ornamentation, windows, or other features such as public art, may also be used. 
c.  Design shall ensure privacy in residential developments through effective window placement, soundproofing, landscape screening or orientation of outdoor living areas (e.g., balconies, porches, patios and etc.). Opposite facing windows at close distances should be offset vertically or horizontally, or employ appropriate materials (e.g., glazed, tinted and etc.) to protect privacy.

f.  Connection to the surrounding community. Mixed-use developments shall not be gated and shall be interconnected to surrounding developments. Mixed-use projects shall be designed as an integral part of the surrounding community and not as an isolated development. 
g.  Phasing. Mixed-use projects may be phased. Site plan submittals meeting all requirements of this chapter and the Wilmington City Code shall be considered a phase. The first phase shall meet all requirements of this chaptere. Additional phases shall become part of the existing development. The entire project, including the first phase and all subsequent phases, shall meet all ordinance requirements as a unified development at all times. The technical review committee may require all external street interconnections, stormwater systems, utilities and other public improvements to be constructed in the first phase to ensure the phase can function as a stand alone mixed-use development. 
(e)  Density. 
(1)  Mixed-use density.

c.  The base density permitted for areas designated Mixed Use in the Watershed Resource Protection and Conservation Land classification categories shall be 0.10 floor area ratio. However, in no case shall the amount of impervious surface exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the entire site area unless the standards for Article 10, Exceptionally Designed Projects, are met. 
d.  Maximum density for areas designated Mixed Use shall be determined by adding the base density to any density bonuses. Density bonuses shall be determined by application of performance measures described in this chapter. In order to be eligible for bonuses in the resource protection category, the applicant shall utilize at least one (1) of the Categories A, B or C environmental bonus items. No density bonuses shall be permitted for portions of the project in the Conservation Land Classification category. 
e.  Floor area ratio (FAR) equals the gross floor area of all buildings in areas designated Mixed Use divided by the mixed-use area (FAR = gross floor area/mixed-use area). 
(2)  Residential density. 
a.  The base density permitted for areas designated Residential in the Developed and Urban Transition Land classification categories shall be eight (8) dwelling units per acre. 
b.  The base density permitted for areas designated Residential in the Resource Protection, Limited Transition, Community, Rural and Conservation Land classification categories shall be two and one-half (2.5) dwelling units per acre. However, in no case shall the amount of impervious surface exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the site area in the Watershed Resource Protection and Conservation Land classification categories and fifty (50) percent in the other land classification categories unless the standards for Article 10, Exceptionally Designed Projects, are met. 
c.  Maximum density for areas designated Residential shall be determined by adding base density to density bonuses. Density bonuses shall be determined by application of performance measures described in this chapter. In order to be eligible for any bonus in the Resource Protection category, the applicant shall utilize at least one (1) of the Category A, B or C environmental bonus items. No density bonuses shall be permitted in the Conservation Land classification category. 
(3)  Density calculations. Density shall be calculated using land use categories (Mixed Use or exclusively Residential).

b.  Residential density shall be calculated using only the gross area identified as Residential (including streets, parking, common space/open space and other features in the residential area). 
c.  Maximum density shall be calculated for each land classification area within the project. Development in that area shall not exceed the density permitted in the underlying land classification category except for bonuses permitted in this chapter. Density shall not be aggregated over the entire site except through the procedures defined in subsection d., below. 
d.  If the applicant designates areas classified Resource Protection or Conservation as not to be developed, the density calculation for the more intense land classification category may be applied to the entire Mixed Use or Residential area. 
e.  Land preserved for the purpose described in subsection d., above, shall only be eligible for full credit towards the minimum open space requirement if it is an integral part of the development. If the entire preserved area is located on the periphery of the development, the area shall only be credited for a maximum fifty (50) percent of the required open space. The purpose of this limit is to ensure open space is not isolated but is an integral part of the development. 
(4)  Density bonuses. In reviewing a final plan/site plan for a mixed-use development, the technical review committee (TRC) shall determine if the applicant meets the requirements for receiving bonuses. Density bonuses are grouped into four (4) categories from highest bonus to lowest bonus. Greater bonuses are awarded for items with more significant benefits to the community. Each item in the categories is eligible for a bonus. The increases in density shall be subject to the following procedures:

(f)  Common space and open space. 
(1)  Purpose: It is intended that MX developments be identifiable by functional common spaces and open space, including but not limited to: natural wetlands, forested areas, atriums, parks, internal courtyards, plazas, or other undisturbed or improved spaces. 
Common spaces shall shape the design and character of the project through a connecting system of pedestrian areas that create a relationship among the various components of the built environment. The pedestrian spaces may include artwork, sculpture and water features to improve their appeal. These spaces shall be designed to create interaction among workers, residents and shoppers. The spaces shall also attempt to provide a pleasant gathering place for transit usage. 
Open spaces can be natural or recreational. Natural open spaces are intended to protect the natural environment, protect water quality and provide habitat for wildlife. Recreation open spaces are intended to provide outdoor active recreation facilities and other activity areas for residents, shoppers and employees. 
Overlap between spaces considered common space and open space is possible. The definitions are not mutually exclusive. Each MX project shall contain a minimum ten (10) percent common space and a minimum twenty-five (25) percent open space. The developer can propose the allocation of land to these categories. However, common space shall be primarily area for social interaction and have more impervious surface. Open space shall be essentially unimproved pervious area with limited modifications. 
a.  Common space: At least ten (10) percent of the acreage of the site shall be devoted to common spaces. 
i.  Common space includes areas where the public is directly or indirectly invited to gather, browse, sit, interact or congregate. Common spaces do not have to be publicly owned. Common areas may include walking paths, bicycle paths, courtyards, plazas and other similar areas. Unimproved natural areas shall not be counted as common space. 
ii.  Common spaces shall be arranged as community spaces with open areas, landscaping, seating facilities and lighting fixtures which provide for safety and visual effects. 
iii.  Common spaces are intended to be places for social interaction and may include impervious surfaces. 
a.  Common space amenities shall include at least three (3) of the following: 
1.  Sidewalks with substantial ornamental treatments (e.g. brick pavers; change in materials, color or texture; use of pervious materials when consistent with Americans with Disabilities Act). 
2.  Sidewalk planters. Planters may be constructed to provide seating around the perimeter. 
3.  Public art (e.g., sculpture, fountain, clock, mural, etc.). 
4.  Street trees of a caliper fifty (50) percent wider than required by this chapter (may include preservation of healthy mature trees adjacent to sidewalks). 
b.  Amenities should be visible and accessible to the general public from an improved street. Access to pocket parks, plazas and sidewalks shall be provided via a right-of-way or a public access easement. 
c.  The size or capacity of pedestrian amenities should be proportional to their expected use, including use by employees, customers, residents, and other visitors. 
d.  Amenities should be consistent with the character and scale of surrounding developments. For example, similarity in awning height, bench style, planter materials, street trees and pavers is recommended to foster continuity in the design of pedestrian areas. Materials should be suitable for outdoor use, easily maintained and have a reasonably long life cycle (e.g., ten (10) years before replacement). 
e.  When provided at or near a bus stop, amenities should conform to standards of the Cape Fear Public Transportation Authority system. 
iv.  The walking areas of common spaces shall be surfaced with concrete, brick, tile or another material approved by the technical review committee. The type of surfacing material shall be identified on the site plan. 
v.  Construction of bus shelters along project perimeters, shall be mandatory wherever the project includes or is adjacent to an existing or previously identified transit line extension proposed in adopted documents by the Cape Fear Public Transportation Authority, or another public transit provider. 
vi.  Parking area landscaping and buffer areas shall not be counted toward meeting this requirement. 
b.  Open space: A minimum twenty-five (25) percent open space shall be provided. 
i.  Open space is any area of land or water essentially unimproved and set aside, dedicated, designated, or reserved for public or private use or enjoyment. Open space may include active recreational facilities such as swimming pools, tot lots, ball fields and picnic tables (recreation open space). However, improved recreational facilities, including golf courses, shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the minimum required open space. 
ii.  Parking area landscaping and buffer areas shall be excluded from this calculation. 
iii.  No more than fifty (50) percent of the open space shall be covered by water unless approved by the technical review committee as part of an active recreation area or regional stormwater facility. Standard stormwater retention facilities that meet only minimum city requirements shall not be counted as open space. 
iv.  The city council may reduce the open space requirement to as low as twenty (20) percent when equivalent land area or property value for community facilities is provided to the city. Community facilities dedicated to the city including, but not limited to, parks, recreation buildings or restoration of historic sites shall be eligible for open space credit. 
v.  Construction of greenways shall be mandatory whenever the project includes or is adjacent to trails identified on a previously adopted greenway plan. 
vi.  All open space shall remain undivided and no lot or unit owner or any other person shall bring any action for partition or division of any part thereof except as provided in G.S. Ch. 47A (Unit Ownership Act). Active recreational facilities such as pools and tennis courts may be controlled by subassociations for the residential components of the project. Each lot or unit owner's undivided interest in the use of reasonably maintained open space shall be preserved through covenants running with the land. Title to such areas shall be encumbered for the perpetual benefit of the public generally or the private properties in the development, and all future use shall be consistent with the open space requirements. Improvements clearly incidental to the purpose of these provisions may be made within the open space. 
vii.  Access to open space: All residential lots or units created within the development shall have direct access to all open space and recreational facilities, as provided, by means of public streets or dedicated walkways or by the fact of physical contiguity to other public land or lands in common ownership of all residents. The developer shall not place age, race, creed, sex or economic restrictions (other than maintenance assessments) upon lot or unit owners for the use of said open space. Land which is restricted in any way so as to be for the use, benefit or enjoyment of a select group within the development shall not qualify as open space. 
viii.  Open space provisions: The developer shall file a declaration of covenants and restrictions running with the land that will govern the open space. This declaration shall be submitted prior to final plat approval. When a property owners' association or other such nonprofit ownership is established, the declaration shall include but not be limited to the following: 
a.  The homeowners' association or the nonprofit organization shall be established before any lots are sold; 
b.  Membership shall be mandatory for each lot buyer and successive buyer; 
c.  The association shall provide for liability insurance, any taxes and the maintenance of all grounds and facilities; 
d.  Any sums levied by the association that remain unpaid shall become a lien upon the lot owner's property. 
(g)  Procedural requirements for the establishment of an MX District. Proposals for an MX District shall be processed in three (3) stages: 1) conceptual review, 2) rezoning application/preliminary site assessment; and 3) final plan/site plan. The conceptual plan shall represent the applicant's general sketch and impression of the anticipated pattern of development planned for the MX District. The preliminary site assessment shall specify existing site conditions and the appropriateness of the site for mixed-use zoning. The final plan shall be the document on which building permits and other applicable city approvals are issued. Each stage shall be processed in the following order:

For buildings greater than thirty-three (33) feet in width, facades shall incorporate periodic transitions no further apart than two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the building height in order to create a vertical orientation. This transition may be achieved by utilizing methods including but not limited to: facade offsets, pilasters or change in materials. For buildings greater than fifty (50) feet in width, facades shall be expressed as two (2) separate building facades utilizing methods including, but not limited to, the aforementioned methods. The predominant orientation of fenestration (window arrangement) within the facade shall also be vertical.

d.  Height relationships. The exterior expression of any building facade that is twenty (20) feet or more in height must be distinguished at a point not less than thirteen (13) feet, four (4) inches above the ground level at the front facade. This distinction may be accomplished by incorporating features that include but are not limited to a horizontal architectural member such as molding or a change in materials or fenestration. 
e.  Building entries and pedestrian-scale design. Facades fronting rights-of-way shall be detailed to create a pedestrian scale. Methods to create pedestrian scale include, but are not limited to: transition of facade materials, definition of entryways with architectural elements such as transoms, moldings, offsets, or recesses. Entrances shall be recessed from the property line allowing a pedestrian space between the sidewalk and the front door. For buildings located on street corners, a corner entrance is permissible. 
f.  Street-level facades. Window glazing shall be the predominant material in the street-level facade. Such glazing shall be transparent under all lighting conditions; however, spandrel or colored glass may be used above the height of the door head. Glazing shall extend from a base of contrasting material to at least the height of the door head. For new buildings on corner lots adjacent to single-family residential zoning, glazing area may be reduced. Glazing shall extend from the corner of the front facade for a depth equal to at least fifty (50) percent of the length of building along the side street building facade. Exterior burglar bars, fixed riot shutters, or similar visible security devices shall not be installed in any new or existing commercial storefront. Residential uses are not permitted on the ground level fronting any facade.

(4)  Appeals from applications to the historic preservation commission shall be to the board of adjustment consistent with section 18-96(c)(9) of this chapter. Applications that receive an unfavorable recommendation from the planning commission may be appealed within ten (10) days of the date of such adverse decision to the city council by filing with the city clerk a notice in writing stating therein the action of the planning commission and the reasons for the appeal. 
(5)  If the city adopts a condemnation ordinance for the structure under articles V, VI, and VII of chapter 16, Buildings and building regulations, of the city's Code of Ordinances, the "contributing historic structure" status shall be removed for the purpose of this section upon adoption of the ordinance. 
(6)  Properties located within the Central Business District, Historic District Overlay [CBD(HDO)] are subject to division V in articles 2 and 3 of this chapter. 
(l)  Redevelopment with height increase for preservation of historic building facades. In order to retain all allowable development height, any redevelopment of a site containing a contributing historic structure as identified by the National Register Historic District inventory on file with the city clerk must preserve facade(s) fronting on any public right-of-way greater than twenty-four (24) feet in width and meet the conditions outlined below. For purposes of this section, a facade includes the building's exterior finish materials and veneer, fenestration, exterior embellishment, and the wall structure that serves as the substrate for the aforementioned items. 
(1)  When a height increase with approved facade preservation is requested under the provisions of this subsection for redevelopment of properties within the Central Business District, Historic District Overlay [CBD(HDO)], the partial demolition, the height increase, and the new building design must be approved by the historic preservation commission and are subject to division V in articles 2 and 3 of this chapter. 
(2)  The height of any new construction above and behind the preserved facade(s) shall be allowed up to the maximum height increase shown on the Central Business District height map (Figure 4). Preservation of the existing historic facade(s) shall be regarded as a public benefit (see Table 1 of this section) that allows the height increase to the applicable maximum height (see Figures 6 and 7). 
(3)  For purposes of this section, new construction that is higher than the preserved historic facade(s) must be set back a minimum of eight (8) feet from the face of the facade(s) which must remain unchanged in appearance. If the depth of the property is greater than eighty (80) feet, the new construction that is higher than the preserved facade must be set back a distance equal to ten (10) percent of the depth of the property up to a maximum setback distance of twenty (20) feet (see Figures 6 and 7). 
(4)  If more than one facade of a building fronts on a right-of-way, the ten (10) percent setback [with twenty-foot maximum] shall apply to new construction behind the facade fronting the greater property depth and only an eight-foot setback shall apply to construction behind any other facade fronting a right-of-way (see Figures 6 and 7). 
(5)  In the case of recombined lots of varying depth, an average depth measurement may be utilized in determining the setback, or alternatively, the new construction above the preserved facade may have varying setbacks relative to the property depths. 
(6)  Additional density of one (1) unit per acre per each one (1) foot of height-increase granted above the by-right height is permitted. 
(7)  Balconies and other architectural elements may encroach into the required new construction setback up to a distance equal to twenty-five (25) percent of the setback depth, but in no case may these elements encroach into the eight-foot minimum setback area. 
(8)  The roof over the setback area may be utilized as the substrate of an open air, aboveground plaza and occupied/utilized for permitted uses unless historic features of the structure would be obscured by any physical elements necessitated by the use. 
(9)  If the site to be redeveloped contains a contributing historic structure that is a one-story or two-story wood frame dwelling, the dwelling may be relocated in lieu of preserving the facade in order to take advantage of the additional height increase as indicated in Table 1, Public benefits matrix. 
(10)  The height increase permitted by this subsection cannot be combined with height increases allowable with the provision of other public benefits listed in Table 1, Public benefits matrix. 


(m)  Demolition requirements and procedures. 
(1)  For demolition of all or a portion of a contributing historic structure that scores six (6) or greater according to the evaluation system in subsection 18-196(k), the following requirements and procedures shall apply:

To promote the preservation of contributing historic structures in the Central Business District ("CBD"), a property owner may elect to maintain such a structure in its preserved or improved condition forgoing any improvement that would have allowed for additional height or density on the site in accordance with this section. In such event, any additional height or density allocation may be transferred as credits to another site in a designated target area of the CBD as follows: 
(1)  The property owner of a contributing historic structure ("transferring property") seeking to transfer additional height and density allocation as credits and the property owner seeking to receive such credits ("receiving property") shall provide evidence of a legally binding agreement, that runs with the land of the transferring property, to preserve the historic contributing structure for a period of at least thirty (30) years. Evidence of such legally binding commitment may be in the form of an easement, covenants, or restrictive deed that is recorded in the New Hanover County Registry. 
(2)  Receiving properties shall include any site located in the CBD, North of Princess Street, including those with frontage along the northern right-of-way, for which no site plan has been approved and is undeveloped as of January 1, 2011. 
(3)  Additional height and density shall be calculated on a floor-to-area ratio of the transferring property. Provided, the height of structures constructed on receiving properties shall not exceed the maximum height requirements as prescribed in Figure 4, Central Business District height map. 
(4)  To receive height and density credits, the property owner of a receiving property shall submit an application to certify the transferred height and density credits. The application shall be submitted along with plans submitted for review and approval in accordance with section 18-60 and include:

Sec. 18-202. - RFMU, Riverfront Mixed Use District. 
(a)  Purpose. The Cape Fear River is one of the region's most valuable natural resources and is the focal point of downtown activity. Therefore, the Riverfront Mixed Use District is established to assure quality development along the river through six (6) main objectives: to enhance and preserve environmentally sensitive areas along the river; to protect public access to the river; to provide quality public spaces; to effect quality design and a variety of built forms that result in a pedestrian scale as well as a compelling skyline; to promote and enhance transit options, particularly those that are pedestrian and water-oriented; and to encourage a mix of uses that foster a sense of community. The RFMU District is not intended to be applied in the historic downtown core of the city generally between Castle and Red Cross Streets. Because of the importance of considering the potential impacts of RFMU Districts on the Cape Fear River and the downtown, it is the intention of the city council to only consider applications for the rezoning of property to the RFMU District through conditional zoning applications pursuant to Division IV of Article 5 of the Land Development Code. In the event of conflict between regulations for riverfront mixed use developments and those in other sections of the City Code, the Riverfront Mixed Use regulations shall supersede unless specifically stated otherwise. 
(b)  Mix of uses. 
(1)  All RFMU developments must contain uses from at least two (2) of the following categories: 
a.  Residential. 
b.  Office.

d.  Helipad, rooftop only. 
e.  Public park, playground and associated facilities. 
f.  Recreation facility, neighborhood. 
(d)  General regulations. The prevalence of environmentally-sensitive areas located along the riverfront requires that flexible development standards be established to realize land development potential while maximizing natural resource protection. The RFMU District is not intended to be applied to the historic core of the city, including the Central Business District (CBD) and the Historic District-Residential (HD-R) areas. Applying the RFMU guidelines to these areas is inappropriate as it would significantly disrupt the historic character and integrity of downtown. 
(1)  Riverfront access: All RFMU developments shall have frontage along the Cape Fear River. A minimum of one (1) pedestrian access shall be provided to the riverfront and shall occur in intervals of no more than two hundred (200) linear feet of shoreline. 
(2)  Lot coverage: Maximum lot coverage, including building footprints and impervious paving materials, shall not exceed fifty (50) percent. 
(3)  Building base: Delineation of the building base is required for buildings exceeding building base height (see Article 15, Definitions). 
(4)  Maximum building height: Building height in the RFMU District shall not exceed fifteen (15) stories, not including levels utilized for structured parking. Additional height up to a maximum of twenty (20) stories may be permitted based on compliance with either of the following performance options: 
a.  Dedication of private land area for public use greater than the required minimum of ten (10) percent. For every five (5) percent of additional permanently designated public space, building height may be increased by one (1) story. 
b.  Reduction of building mass greater than the required minimum of twenty-five (25) percent. For every additional five (5) percent of building mass reduction above the "building base," building height may be increased by one (1) story. 
(5)  Building envelope: All buildings exceeding the building base elevation shall reduce building mass by no less than twenty-five (25) percent of the total mass occurring above the building base, as measured from the building base to the overall height of the building, multiplied by the total area of the building footprint using the following equation: 
(Proposed Height-Building Base) × (Footprint) × (0.25) = Minimum Building Mass Reduction (Above building base) 
(6)  Building setbacks and separations: All buildings shall be set back a minimum of sixteen (16) feet from the riverfront, public rights-of-way and private streets. All buildings greater than thirty-five (35) feet in height shall be set back a minimum of seventy-five (75) feet from the river's edge. All buildings less than fifty (50) feet in height adjacent to single-family uses or zoning districts, excluding those separated by public rights-of-way, shall have a minimum setback from adjacent single-family residential property lines equal to the height of the building. Buildings over fifty (50) feet in height, excluding those separated by public rights-of-way, shall have a minimum setback of fifty (50) feet from adjacent single-family residential property lines. 
(7)  Underground utilities: All electric, cable television and telephone utilities, fire alarm conduits, streetlight wiring and other wiring conduits and similar utilities shall be placed underground by the developer or the appropriate utility company for all new RFMU developments. 
(8)  Minimum landscaping: 
a.  Shade trees are required along all public and private streets. Canopy trees, as identified in the city's Technical Standards Manual, shall be a minimum caliper of three (3) inches DBH, shall be located at a minimum fifty (50) feet on center, and must be single-stem canopy trees. 
b.  Public spaces and common areas shall be planted with a minimum of two (2) single stem canopy trees per every one thousand (1,000) square feet. Canopy trees shall be a minimum caliper of three (3) inches DBH. Three (3) understory trees may be substituted for two (2) canopy trees per one thousand (1,000) square feet of public space or common area where overhead obstructions or other site limitations make canopy trees impractical. 
The TRC may permit alternatives to strict conformance with the required location of landscaping under the following conditions. In all cases, RFMU developments shall provide at least the minimum square footage of landscaped area and number of trees required by the city's landscaping regulations. 
i.  Preservation of natural stands of trees and existing vegetation. Preservation of natural stands of trees may be substituted for landscaping requirements if the total square footage of interior landscaping meets the minimum required quality and quantity of trees. 
ii.  Additional landscaping in key areas. Provision of at least ten (10) percent greater than the minimum landscaping area required in each of the following areas: along the riverfront, at project entrances, and in public spaces. 
iii.  Provision of low impact development. Landscaping necessary to achieve low-impact development standards as defined by the exceptionally designed projects regulations. 
(9)  Signs: The following sign requirements shall apply to all RFMU developments:

Two (2) monument signs are allowed at the main entranceway, one (1) on each side of the road or driveway with a combined total area not to exceed one hundred fifty (150) square feet and with a maximum vertical dimension of four (4) feet. Secondary entranceways shall be restricted to one (1) monument sign, not to exceed eighteen (18) square feet in area and a vertical dimension of four (4) feet. However, if incorporated within an entry wall or other entry feature, two (2) secondary entranceway signs are allowed, one (1) on each side of the access road, not to exceed a combined total surface area of twenty-seven (27) square feet and a vertical dimension of four (4) feet. 
v.  The main entranceway sign text is limited to the development name and the name of one (1) tenant. Sign area devoted to a tenant name is limited to twenty-five (25) percent of any sign area. Secondary entranceway text is limited to the development name only. 
vi.  Internal illumination is prohibited except for kinetic signs in accordance with Mixed Use (MX) standards. 
(10)  Parking requirements: 
a.  Surface parking may not exceed five (5) percent of the total number of parking spaces provided or fifty (50) spaces, whichever is less, for each RFMU development. A parking structure is considered part of the building footprint when a common wall is shared between the parking structure and the building. 
b.  Surface parking shall be located to the side or rear of buildings or in the interior of a block. Surface parking shall not be located on the riverfront side of buildings. Surface parking shall be reserved for nonresidential uses, including loading areas and emergency vehicle access, and must be clearly designated as such. 
c.  There is no minimum or maximum parking requirement for residential uses. 
d.  On-street parking is permitted, but shall not be counted toward required parking for commercial uses. 
e.  The design of all above-grade parking structures shall relate to the context of the area. Exterior walls of parking structures shall be designed with materials, colors, and architectural articulation in a manner that provides a visual compatibility with adjacent buildings and environment. All parking structures shall be visually obscured from the river. Structured parking shall not satisfy the nonresidential use requirement. 
f.  Pervious pavement materials, vegetated bio-infiltration parking lot islands, or infiltration systems shall be used wherever practical to minimize pollutant run-off from surface parking areas. 
g.  Parking structure design and elevations shall be included for review as part of the concept plan. 
(11)  General site design: Each of the following components shall be included in RFMU developments. The site plan submitted for city review shall include a narrative describing how the project will incorporate each of these components: 
a.  Clearly defined common spaces. Plazas, courtyards, riverwalks and other areas are necessary to provide for public gathering and interaction. Amenities such as benches, planters, lighting, fountains, art and landscaping that further the design theme of the project and encourage interaction are required. 
b.  View corridors. Views of the Cape Fear River shall not be significantly obstructed by buildings or other structures. All developments shall provide view corridors along all east/west streets that traditionally terminated at the river, as depicted on the 1945 Corporate Limit Map. Such view corridors shall remain unobstructed by buildings or structures from the ground to the sky. Any new street that terminates within fifty (50) feet of the riverwalk shall provide a public access area that is a clearly defined entry point to the required riverwalk. 
c.  Multi-modal transportation opportunities. Public boating, walking, bicycling, or water taxi services and the facilities necessary for such uses. 
i.  Pedestrian accessibility and concentration of development (critical mass) within a compact, walkable area. Pedestrian circulation shall be clearly defined with paving materials and/or landscaping and shall connect all uses. 
ii.  Bicycle and/or pedestrian connectivity to adjacent or nearby developments is required in areas where vehicular access is not provided. 
iii.  Sidewalks are required on each side of rights-of-way and private streets throughout the development and are to be installed along all building frontages. Sidewalks shall maintain a minimum width of sixteen (16) feet. Sidewalk width may be reduced on internal private streets with TRC approval. Sidewalks may be limited to a single side of rights-of-way or private streets or sidewalk width may be reduced when right-of-way or private street abuts streams, ponds, or wetlands or when contextual design constraints dictate, as determined by the TRC. 
d.  Integrated design of the project. Projects require special attention to building design due to the intermixing of land uses. Functional integration of residential and commercial uses shall be considered during design of RFMU projects. The following standards are intended to guide development of such projects: 
i.  [Orientation of primary building entrances:] Primary building entrances shall be oriented toward public sidewalks along primary street or riverwalk frontages. Development along new or existing public streets shall have pedestrian-friendly facades achieved through appropriate scale and quality materials. 
ii.  Massing and development scale: No visible facade shall be "blank" or without features or detail. Facades shall incorporate periodic transitions no farther apart than two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the building height in order to create a vertical orientation. This transition may be achieved by utilizing at least two (2) methods including, but not limited to the use of facade offsets, recesses, pilasters or change in materials. For buildings exceeding four (4) stories or fifty (50) feet, whichever is less, facades shall incorporate a visual transition to distinguish the building base from the upper floors of the building. This transition may be achieved by utilizing at least two (2) methods including, but not limited to the use of building facade offsets, cornices, belt courses, moldings or other linear motifs. 
For buildings greater than eighty (80) feet in width, facades shall be expressed as at least two (2) or more separate facades utilizing the aforementioned methods in this subsection. The predominant orientation of fenestration within the facade shall be vertical. Horizontal bands or "ribbons" of windows shall not be permitted within the first four (4) stories or fifty (50) feet of building height, whichever is less. At least sixty (60) percent of the ground-level facade shall be constructed of transparent materials or otherwise designed to allow pedestrian view of inside activities. 
iii.  Height relationships: The exterior expression of the first level of any building facade must be distinguished at a point not less than thirteen (13) feet, six (6) inches above the ground level at the front facade. This distinction may be accomplished by methods including, but not limited to, the use of moldings, belt courses, a change in materials or fenestration, or building facade offsets. 
iv.  Screening: All dumpsters, loading docks, outside storage areas, utility structures, and ground-level mechanical equipment shall be screened on all sides. Screening shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in height and shall consist of living and nonliving material as specified in the city landscaping code. Chain link fencing shall not be permitted. 
e.  Dwelling unit size. Minimum residential unit size shall be seven hundred fifty (750) square feet. 
(e)  Public space. 
(1)  Purpose: RFMU developments shall incorporate public spaces that may be provided in the form of natural areas, atriums, parks, courtyards, plazas, or other undisturbed or improved spaces. 
Each RFMU project shall contain a minimum ten (10) percent functional public space, in addition to a riverwalk as defined in this section. "Functional" public spaces are intended to provide opportunities to interface with landscaped, natural or cultural public amenities. Rights-of-way, other than sidewalks along streets, may be included within public space calculations only if the right-of-way serves to provide pedestrian access to these public amenities. 
Public spaces shall be pedestrian-oriented and shall shape the design and character of the project through a connecting system of pedestrian areas that create a relationship among the various components of the built environment. The pedestrian areas shall be integrated with features such as landscaping, gardens, benches, artwork, sculpture and water features to improve their appeal. Public space areas shall provide adequate amenities for comfort and convenience such as seating, lighting, directional signage, bicycle racks, drinking fountains, shelters, trash receptacles, and public restrooms. 
Public spaces shall be visible, easily accessible, and barrier-free with multiple points of entry from public areas (streets, sidewalks, walkways, the riverwalk, and bike paths). Public spaces shall be oriented to maximize exposure to the river and scenic views. Streets that connect to the river shoreline shall be designed as landscaped corridors that terminate with pedestrian access to the river. 
Plants used in landscaping areas shall be native species, of the highest quality, and of sufficient quantity and scale to make a visual impact. Plantings shall be selected and located so that their functional and aesthetic qualities can be maximized. Public space shall provide areas shaded by trees and/or structures. Small-scale stormwater treatment shall be integrated into the landscaping wherever possible, including recessed landscaped areas with curb openings or sloped curbs to serve as rain gardens or bioinfiltration areas. Restoration of wetland vegetation and natural habitat is encouraged along the riverfront. 
Where sites providing an opportunity and context for historical interpretation exist along the riverfront, they shall be incorporated into public space areas and appropriately commemorated and marked with interpretive signage. 
Artwork is strongly encouraged to be integrated into public space settings wherever possible. Artwork may consist of freestanding pieces (e.g., sculptures and fountains) or may be integrated with surroundings (e.g., relief sculpture embedded into pavement or wall, mosaics, murals, decorative fixtures, etc.) to create a strong visual interest. Artwork should be custom-made in order to be context-appropriate, reinforcing and complementing the character of the riverfront. Public spaces designed to accommodate live performing arts and public gatherings should be integrated into the development whenever feasible. 
(2)  Riverwalk: Riverfront properties provide the unique opportunity for public space in the form of a riverwalk along the Cape Fear River corridor. A riverwalk not only provides access to the river but also accents this significant community asset and draws activity to the river corridor. All RFMU developments shall construct a continuous and contiguous public riverwalk to meet city-approved standards along the river's edge for a length as defined by the development's property boundaries. 
a.  Easement and access: Public access across the property, between the river's edge and the public right-of-way, private street, or structure running parallel with the river's edge, shall be provided at a minimum width of ten (10) feet. This access shall be granted through an easement or other property interest as approved by the city attorney. The access shall meet ADA design standards. 
Developments shall provide public access connections to a riverwalk at intervals of no more than two hundred (200) feet. These walkways should be landscaped and designed with a series of public spaces to accentuate the pedestrian experience. This access shall be granted through an easement or other property interest as approved by the city attorney. The access shall meet ADA design standards. 
The "river's edge" shall be defined as the "normal high water" (NHW) level measured from the river's edge to the proposed building elevation closest to and facing the river. "Normal high water" is established by a field representative from the division of coastal management or by the New Hanover County Local Permit Officer when an application for a CAMA permit has been submitted. 
b.  Construction plans for a riverwalk shall be approved by the city manager or designee, in consultation with the city engineer, and shall be designed to accommodate future connections to adjacent parcels. 
(3)  Dock space: Private dock space shall not restrict public access to the riverwalk. 
(f)  Procedural requirements for the establishment of a RFMU District. Proposals for a RFMU District shall be processed in three (3) stages: 
(1)  Conceptual review; 
(2)  Rezoning application/preliminary site assessment; and 
(3)  Final plan/site plan. All stages shall be processed subject to the procedural requirements of the Mixed Use (MX) District. The conceptual plan shall be a sketch that represents the applicant's general impression of the anticipated pattern of development. The preliminary site assessment shall specify existing site conditions and indicate the appropriateness of the site for RFMU zoning. The final plan shall provide the documentation for which building permits and all applicable city, state, and federal approvals are issued.

Sec. 18-203. - RO, Residential Office District. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the Residential Office District is to allow for the conversion of existing single-family homes to offices and other compatible low-intensity uses. This district is intended to facilitate redevelopment options that will retain and enhance area character, minimize impacts on adjacent residential uses, encourage the adaptive reuse of existing residential structures, encourage new development to be of a residential scale and proportion, ensure compatibility of building and site design in the district, protect trees, require interconnectivity, including bicycle and pedestrian connections, and control access to minimize the impacts of redevelopment on Oleander Drive. This zoning district is only intended for parcels fronting Oleander Drive generally between Pine Grove Drive and 51st Street. Where these regulations conflict with the other sections of this chapter or the city's Technical Standards and Specifications Manual, these regulations shall apply. 
(b)  Uses permitted by right. The following uses are permitted in the RO district, provided that they meet all of the requirements of this section and all other applicable requirements established in this chapter: 
(1)  Artists, commercial including silk screening. 
(2)  Consulting services.

(1)  Additions or expansions to existing structures where the gross building footprint of the entire structure would be greater than two thousand one hundred (2,100) square feet. 
(2)  Construction of a new primary structure. 
(3)  Recombination of lots to a lot width greater than one hundred (100) linear feet. 
(4)  Day care, adult or child. 
(5)  Group home residential. 
(6)  Reserved. 
(e)  Permitted accessory uses and structures. The following accessory uses and structures, clearly incidental and subordinate to the principal use and structure, are permitted provided only one accessory building is permitted per lot and that they meet all requirements of this section, article 6, and all other applicable requirements established in this chapter: 
(1)  Accessory building. 
(2)  Accessory apartment, attached. 
(3)  Accessory apartment, detached. 
(f)  Development standards. All uses and structures permitted in the district shall meet the applicable development standards established in this section and all other applicable requirements of this chapter: 
(1)  Dimensional requirements. 
a.  Minimum lot area (square feet): 15,000. 
b.  Maximum residential density (u/a): 6. 
c.  Minimum lot width (feet): 80 (200 max with SUP). 
d.  Maximum lot coverage (%): 50.

g.  Minimum interior side setback (feet): 10. 
h.  Minimum corner lot side setback (feet): 15. 
i.  Maximum building height: 2 stories or 35 feet, whichever is less. 
j.  Minimum setback for parking areas: 5 feet from all property lines. 
(2)  Site design standards. 
a.  Nonresidential uses or conversion to uses other than single-family detached shall not be permitted by the conversion of any structure or premises originally designed for a residential use unless the existing residential character of the building is retained. 
b.  Buildings, driveways, parking areas, loading areas, outdoor activity areas, light sources, trash areas, and other potential nuisances shall be located and designed to minimize adverse impacts on abutting residential properties. In order to limit potential adverse impacts, the technical review committee (TRC) may require alternative site layouts, including increased setbacks from residential property lines, different locations of buildings, parking areas, and driveways, and increased screening for light sources and activity areas. 
c.  The overall character of the site in terms of existing topography and vegetation shall be retained. Grading to modify the topography is not permitted except to correct drainage problems, as approved by the TRC. 
d.  Additions to existing structures. No additions to or extensions of existing structures shall be made to the front or side(s) of the structure. 
1.  Any addition or extension that increases the gross building footprint of the entire structure to more than two thousand one hundred (2,100) square feet shall require a special use permit. 
2.  Additions and extensions shall maintain the character of the existing structure in terms of massing, scale, roof pitch, setback, building materials, orientation, and fenestration. 
e.  Exterior building materials. Predominant exterior building materials for all new structures and additions to existing structures shall be limited to one or more of the following: 
1.  Wood siding or shingles. 
2.  Brick. 
3.  Stacked stone. 
4.  Fiber cement siding or shingles. 
f.  Driveway access controls. The intent of this section is to provide for cross-access and shared driveways between compatible land uses to reduce conflict points and minimize traffic flow interruptions on Oleander Drive. Cross-access easements create a service drive providing vehicular access between two (2) or more contiguous parcels so that motorists and/or pedestrians do not need to reenter Oleander Drive to gain access to adjacent uses. Cross access between adjacent properties reduces vehicular conflict points between motorists on the main street and motorists entering and leaving driveways. Reduced traffic conflicts result in fewer accidents and improved traffic flow on Oleander Drive. When driveway easements and cross-access easements are created to serve more than one (1) lot, an owners' association or binding contract for the purpose of maintenance is encouraged. 
1.  No more than one (1) driveway access shall be permitted per street frontage. 
2.  Along Oleander Drive, all uses other than single-family detached uses shall be required to share access with the adjacent RO-zoned property whenever the duplex, triplex, quadraplex, or nonresidential use has proposed access to Oleander Drive through the provision of an easement to the adjacent RO-zoned property. When driveway access is available on an abutting property, the proposed nonresidential use, duplex, triplex, or quadraplex shall utilize this access. If shared access cannot be provided via an existing driveway on an abutting property, access shall be provided in such a way that maximizes the potential for shared access in the future, as outlined below. 
a.  Shared access via existing driveways. 
i.  When the nearest edge of an existing driveway on an adjacent RO-zoned nonresidential, duplex, triplex, or quadraplex used property with frontage on Oleander Drive is within fifty (50) feet of the proposed duplex, triplex, quadraplex, or nonresidential use, the proposed use shall utilize the driveway on the adjacent tract as a shared access, provided an easement granting access has been recorded. 
ii.  The shared driveway shall be the sole access to the site from Oleander Drive and any existing driveway(s) accessing Oleander Drive shall be eliminated. 
iii.  Shared access shall not be required when all possible interconnections between two abutting properties would cross twenty (20) linear feet or more of wetlands, and/or floodplains. 
b.  Shared access via new or existing driveway on a property. 
i.  When shared access cannot be provided via an existing driveway consistent with the requirements of this section (above), a maximum of one (1) driveway to Oleander Drive shall be permitted on the property. 
ii.  The driveway shall be located to maximize interconnectivity, as approved by the TRC. In order to accommodate required sight distances or preserve environmental features, this driveway shall not be set back from the side lot line more than forty (40) feet. Shared access shall not be required when all possible interconnections between two abutting lots would cross twenty (20) linear feet or more of wetlands and/or floodplains. 
iii.  Each use other than single-family detached shall provide a cross-access easement to this driveway guaranteeing access to all abutting lots zoned RO. An accessway may not be blocked off, parked in, or otherwise obstructed. The access easement shall provide access from the closest adjacent property line to the driveway. The easement between the driveway and the closest adjacent lot shall be in a logical location for connection to the adjacent lot, shall be located behind the primary structure, and shall be a minimum of twelve (12) feet wide. The TRC may waive the cross-access requirement if it would cause five (5) or more contiguous lots to be interconnected. 
iv.  Existing driveways not meeting the requirements in this section shall be eliminated during the redevelopment/conversion of the property. 
v.  The location of the driveway intersection with Oleander Drive and with the easement connection to the adjacent lot shall be subject to approval by the TRC based on the potential to minimize the need for future driveways, preserve existing buildings and trees, and/or maximize the distance from the existing street and driveway intersection, including consideration of safe sight distances. 
vi.  Parking shall not be permitted along shared driveways between Oleander Drive and the rear edge of the easement granting access to the abutting lot. 
3.  For properties located on the north side of Oleander Drive that are developed with uses other than single-family detached, vehicular access to the alley is not permitted. 
4.  Each use other than single-family detached shall provide access easements for its parking aisles and driveways guaranteeing access and use to all abutting lots within the RO district, unless all possible interconnections would cross twenty (20) linear feet or more of wetlands, and/or floodplains. Parking areas on abutting lots shall be directly connected by a driveway. These interconnections shall be constructed during the initial conversion/redevelopment, or if an interconnection is not currently feasible, escrow funds for future construction while also providing an easement to the abutting lot allowing future construction when the abutting lot converts/redevelops as an RO use. 
g.  Parking. Parking is not permitted in front yards or between the primary structure and Oleander Drive. This regulation may be waived by the TRC for existing structures converted to a duplex, triplex, quadraplex or nonresidential use where site constraints prohibit access to the rear or side yard. 
1.  Off-street parking surfaces shall be of pervious materials, where soils are suitable. 
2.  The minimum required number of off-street parking spaces may be reduced by up to twenty-five (25) percent, as approved by the TRC. 
3.  All parking areas shall be screened from adjacent non-RO-zoned residential uses and along the alley north of Oleander Drive with a minimum ten-foot wide vegetative buffer and solid six-foot to ten-foot tall wood fence. A minimum of one (1) row of planted materials consisting of a combination of trees and shrubs shall be provided at a minimum height of three (3) feet at planting and give at least fifty (50) percent opacity of the fence at planting. To provide a variety of height and depth, at least one (1) tree on average will be planted for every thirty (30) linear feet of screen. 
h.  Screening. Any ground-level mechanical equipment (such as HVAC, electrical panels, and similar mechanical equipment), shall be screened from view from any right-of-way with a vegetative screen tall enough to shield the equipment. 
1.  Dumpsters shall be prohibited. Trash should be kept inside a principal building until collection, where possible. 
2.  Outdoor storage of equipment and/or materials shall be prohibited. 
i.  Signage. Signage shall be limited to mounted monument-style signs, either freestanding or ground mounted. Other sign types shall be prohibited. All other pertinent sign regulations shall apply. 
1.  Signs shall be compatible with the architecture and materials of the principal structure. 
2.  Signs shall not exceed six (6) feet in height. 
3.  The total sign area shall be limited to thirty-two (32) square feet. 
4.  Signs shall be set back a minimum of five (5) feet and a maximum of fifteen (15) feet. 
5.  Internal illumination and changeable copy, electronic or otherwise, are prohibited. 
6.  Landscaping shall be provided around the base of the sign on all sides. A minimum of forty (40) square feet of ground cover, not including nonornamental grasses, shall be provided. 
j.  Site lighting. Any exterior lighting shall be limited to cut-off or shielded type luminaries and shall be directed toward the center of the property. In no case shall site lighting be located or installed so as to shine directly onto neighboring properties or the public right-of-way. The height of any exterior lighting shall not exceed ten (10) feet in height and shall maintain a clearance of at least eight (8) feet above any pedestrian area. A lighting plan shall be submitted as part of any TRC application. 
k.  Landscaping and buffers. All new construction or conversion of structures to a duplex, triplex, quadraplex, or nonresidential use shall be subject to the parking lot landscaping and O&I-1 street yard requirements of article 8 of this chapter. Preservation of natural stands of trees and native vegetation may be substituted for interior landscaping requirements when the square footage of the preserved area is at least equal to the minimum square footage required for new landscaping. 
1.  A buffer consisting of a minimum ten (10) feet of vegetation and solid six-foot to ten-foot tall wood fence shall be provided adjacent to non-RO-zoned residential uses and along the alley north of Oleander Drive. A minimum of one (1) row of planted materials consisting of a combination of trees and shrubs shall be provided at a minimum height of three (3) feet at planting and be at least fifty (50) percent opaque at planting. To provide a variety of height and depth, at least one (1) tree on average will be planted for every thirty (30) linear feet of screen. 
l.  Drive-through windows shall be prohibited. 
(Ord. No. O-2010-76, § 1, 10-5-10; Ord. No. O-2011-41, § 1, 6-7-11; Ord. No. O-2018-47, § 27, 6-19-18, eff. 3-1-2019) 
Sec. 18-204. - UMX, Urban Mixed Use District. 
(a)  Purpose. The urban core of the city, primarily that area within the 1945 corporate limits, contributes to the unique character of the City of Wilmington. The UMX is established to assure an appropriate development pattern is maintained within the 1945 corporate limits through five (5) main objectives: to enhance and preserve existing urban development patterns by encouraging compatible infill and redevelopment; to affect quality design and a variety of built forms of lasting value that result in a pedestrian scale; to provide a mix of housing options; to promote and enhance transit options, particularly those that are pedestrian-oriented, while reducing demand for automobile trips; and to encourage a mix of uses that fosters a sense of community. The district regulations include design elements intended to enhance the urban form, increase neighborhood safety, add flexibility for small, urban lots, and complement the historic built environment. Integrated mixes of uses on development sites and within individual buildings is encouraged. UMX zoning inside the 1945 corporate limits is intended to reinforce and restore traditional mixed-use patterns in the older parts of Wilmington. UMX zoning outside the 1945 corporate limits is intended to promote mixed-use developments on sites large enough to create a mix of uses within the existing suburban environment. Typically these developments will include creative development and redevelopment solutions such as integrated, vertical mixed use and structured parking. This district is not intended to be applied to the Central Business District (CBD), nor any of the historic districts. 
(b)  Uses. 
(1)  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 18-173, any use is permitted in the UMX provided it meets all other provisions of this chapter, except for the following: 
a.  Adult establishments. 
b.  Electronic gaming. 
c.  Garbage collection, private. 
d.  Gas companies. 
e.  Manufactured homes sales. 
f.  Motor freight companies. 
g.  Movers, van lines, and storage. 
h.  Nightclubs. 
(2)  Uses permitted under prescribed conditions. The following uses are permitted provided that they meet all requirements of this section, Article 6, and all other applicable requirements established in these regulations. 
a.  Auxiliary uses and wares. 
b.  Communications facilities. 
c.  Freestanding structured parking decks. 
d.  Group home supportive, small, medium, large. 
e.  Reserved. 
f.  Industrial uses greater than ten thousand (10,000) square feet, provided they are housed within a building existing at the time of adoption of this ordinance. 
g.  Utility stations and plants outside public rights-of-way (public and private), including lift stations, substations, pump stations, etc. 
h.  Breweries, small regional and microbreweries. 
i.  Artisan food and beverage producers. 
j.  Homestay lodging. 
k.  Whole-house lodging. 
(3)  Permitted by special use permit. The following uses are permitted subject to the issuance of a special use permit and provided that they meet all requirements of this section, Article 6, and all other applicable requirements established in these regulations. 
a.  Automobile renting and leasing. 
b.  Automotive services and towing service. 
c.  Communication facilities, including radio and television stations, cellular telephone facilities, towers, etc. 
d.  Contractor equipment or supply dealers and service. 
e.  Contractor storage yard. 
f.  Dormitories, private. 
g.  Drive-through services. 
h.  Group day facility. 
i.  Industrial and manufacturing uses greater than ten thousand (10,000) square feet. 
j.  Motor vehicle dealers, including automobiles, boat dealers, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, and utility trailers. 
k.  Tire dealers and service. 
l.  Group home residential. 
(4)  All UMX sites outside the 1945 corporate limits shall include a mix of both residential and nonresidential uses. 
(c)  General regulations. The historic urban development pattern inside the 1945 corporate limits frequently includes a fine-grain mix of uses on multiple parcels within close proximity to one another. The mix of uses is achieved through many smaller, independent parcels working together in a greater context. Parcels outside the 1945 corporate limits shall have a minimum lot area of five (5) acres, so as to be able to accommodate a mix of uses on a single site. 
(1)  Maximum building height: Along arterial streets, building height shall not exceed four (4) stories or forty-five (45) feet. Building height along arterial streets may be increased to seventy-five (75) feet with the issuance of a special use permit or entry into a development agreement in accordance with G.S. §§160A-400.20 through 160A-400.32 that provides for such increase. Along residential and collector streets, building height shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet or two (2) stories. Outside the 1945 corporate limits, for parcels fronting arterials or internal collector streets, building height may be increased to five (5) stories or fifty-five (55) feet if structured parking is provided within the project. Roadway classifications are according to the Wilmington Metropolitan Planning Organization Functional Classification Map. 
(2)  Building setbacks:

DIVISION III. - OVERLAY DISTRICTS 

Sec. 18-211. - FP, Floodplain Overlay District. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose for identifying this area on the zoning map is to alert all persons concerned to the fact that development within designated floodplains must conform to the adopted ordinance entitled "The Floodplain Management Regulations of the City of Wilmington," as amended. It is the intent of the council of the City of Wilmington to promote the public health, safety and general welfare with measures designed to minimize private and public losses of life, property, commerce and services from the hazards of floods through the enforcement of the above-referenced ordinance. 
(b)  District provisions. The Floodplain Overlay is established as a district which overlaps other zoning districts established by this chapter. The extent and boundaries of the Floodplain Overlay District shall be delineated on the official zoning map of the City of Wilmington, but final determination shall be identified from the flood hazard boundary maps (FPBM), No. 370171-0001A and No. 370171-0002A, dated April 17, 1978, and any subsequent revisions thereto; or from "The Flood Insurance Study for the City of Wilmington, North Carolina," dated April 17, 1978, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps, and flood boundary and special flood hazard maps and any subsequent revisions thereto. While the Floodplain Overlay District may overlap any zoning district classification, or any portion thereof, established by this chapter, the land use provisions of the underlying district shall prevail in the development of any property within such district; provided, the provisions of the above-referenced "Floodplain Management Regulations of the City of Wilmington" are adhered to in any construction, reconstruction and alteration to the land and/or structures within this district. 
Sec. 18-212. - SHOD, Special Highway Overlay District. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the Special Highway Overlay District (SHOD) is to protect the natural beauty and scenic vista that exists along interstate highways and other specifically designated roadways that serve as major accesses and gateways into the City of Wilmington. Protection of these roadways is important and necessary to maintain and preserve the undisturbed roadsides that are characterized by their natural woodlands and open spaces. The continued protection of these scenic highways is also a valuable asset to the tourism economy and enhances the attractiveness of the area for trade and investment. 
    The Special Highway Overlay District shall be in addition to any other zoning districts where applied so that any parcel of land lying in a SHOD may also lie in one (1) or more of the zoning districts provided for by this chapter. The development of all uses permitted by right or by special use permit in the underlying district, if any, shall be subject to the requirements of both the SHOD and the underlying zoning district. In the event the SHOD requirements conflict with the underlying district requirements, the requirements of the SHOD shall take precedence. If specified by the underlying district, the requirements of the underlying district shall be followed. 
(b)  Applicability. It is hereby required that all nonresidential structures, buildings and improvements to property located within the SHOD comply with the following regulations.

No building shall be located less than twenty-five (25) feet from any property line. However, the setback may be reduced for those buildings, accessory uses and off-street parking by a maximum of twenty-five (25) percent if the project provides additional plantings along the right-of-way. At a minimum, these plantings shall consist of one (1) deciduous or evergreen tree of at least three-inch caliper for every forty (40) feet of road frontage. These streetscape trees must be selected and planted in accordance with Article 8 of this chapter. Plantings must be located in the first ten (10) feet of land adjacent to and parallel to the right-of-way except that plantings may be moved outside this area if it is determined that overhead power lines would interfere with the tree's natural growth. 
(d)  Enclosed facilities. All manufacturing, offices, wholesaling, retail sales, and related storage shall be conducted within an enclosed building, except that the display of automobiles and/or boats in the front, side or rear yard areas may be permitted provided the minimum setback applicable to parking lots is met and all other side and rear setbacks are met. If the storage and/or display of boats and autos are adjacent to residentially zoned property occupied by a residential use or a platted residential lot, then storage or display shall be screened from view of the residential use on lot. 
(e)  Outside storage. Outside storage can be permitted if it is located directly to the rear of the principal building and is not visible from any location along the designated highway. The outside storage area shall not occupy an area wider than the principal building or larger than one-half (1/2) the area of the principal building. The outside storage area must be screened with a buffer strip in accordance with Article 8, Division VII. No storage shall be permitted above the height of the screen.

Sec. 18-214. - Historic District-Overlay (HD-O). 
    This Historic District-Overlay is hereby established pursuant to G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 19. 
(a)  Purpose. A Historic District-Overlay is established for the purpose of protecting and preserving areas which, as a result of their architectural significance, historic importance, or their overall aesthetic qualities, are important elements of the character and heritage of the city, county, and state; safeguarding the qualities of a Historic District-Overlay as a whole and individual property therein which embodies important elements of the Historic District-Overlay's social, economic, cultural or architectural traditions; promoting the conservation of the city's neighborhood resources for the continued use, education, pleasure and enrichment of the residents of a Historic District-Overlay, and the city, county, and state as a whole; and stabilizing property values within a Historic District-Overlay as a whole, and thereby contributing to the improvement of the general welfare of the City of Wilmington. 
(b)  District provisions. A Historic District-Overlay is established as a district which overlaps other zoning districts established by this chapter. The extent and boundaries of a Historic District-Overlay shall be indicated on the official zoning map for the City of Wilmington. While a Historic District-Overlay may overlap any zoning district classification or portion thereof established by this chapter, the existing land use provisions of the underlying district shall prevail in the development of any property within such district; provided, however, that before work is begun on any construction, alteration, demolition, relocation or any other activity commenced that would substantially alter the appearance or character of any appurtenant feature within a Historic District-Overlay, a certificate of appropriateness shall be issued by the historic preservation commission prior to the issuance of any building or other permit required by the City of Wilmington.

DIVISION IV. - CONDITIONAL ZONING 

Sec. 18-226. - Purpose. 
    A conditional zoning district allows particular uses to be established only in accordance with specific standards and conditions pertaining to each individual development project. Some land uses are of such a nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediately surrounding area and on the entire community which cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards. There are also circumstances in which a general district designation allowing such a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of these regulations, the adopted land use plan, adopted area plans and other long range plans. The review process established in this division provides for the accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a conditional zoning district, subject to specific conditions which ensure compatibility of the use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties. A conditional zoning district is generally not intended for securing early zoning for a proposal, except when that proposal is consistent with an approved district or area plan or the proposal can demonstrate that public infrastructure needed to serve the development will be made available within a reasonable time period. A separate master plan approval process as described in this division may be utilized only when a proposal is (i) a component of a development project that is the subject of a development agreement between the City of Wilmington and a developer pursuant to G.S. § 160A-400.20 et seq. ("Development Agreement") or (ii) located within a high intensity area of opportunity in the comprehensive plan.

Sec. 18-227. - Plans and other information to accompany petition. 
(a)  Property may be rezoned to a conditional zoning district only in response to and consistent with a petition submitted by the owners of all of the property to be included in the district. A petition for conditional zoning must include a site plan, drawn to scale, and supporting information and text that specifies the actual use or uses intended for the property and any rules, regulations, and conditions that, in addition to all predetermined ordinance requirements, will govern the development and use of the property. The following information must be provided: 
(1)  A boundary survey and vicinity map showing the property's total acreage, its zoning classification(s), the general location in relation to major streets, railroads, and/or waterways, the date, and north arrow; 
(2)  All existing easements, reservations, and rights-of-way; 
(3)  Approximate location on the site of proposed buildings, structures and other improvements; 
(4)  Approximate dimensions, including height of proposed buildings and other structures; 
(5)  Proposed use of all land and structures, including the number of residential units and the total square footage of any nonresidential development; 
(6)  All yards, buffers, screening, and landscaping required by this chapter or proposed by the petitioner; 
(7)  All existing and proposed points of access to public streets; 
(8)  Delineation of areas within the regulatory floodplain as shown on the official flood hazard boundary maps for the City of Wilmington; 
(9)  Proposed phasing, if any; 
(10)  The location of existing and proposed storm drainage patterns and facilities intended to serve the proposed development; 
(11)  Approximate location of all existing and proposed infrastructure on the site, including water, sewer, roads and pedestrian walkways; 
(12)  Generalized traffic, parking, and circulation plans; 
(13)  Tree survey, if required by this chapter; and 
(14)  Site inventory as required by this chapter. 
(b)  Exception to site plan submittal for (i) proposed conditional zoning districts that are components of development projects that are subject to development agreement, and (ii) high intensity areas of opportunity. 
(1)  For a proposed conditional zoning district constituting a component of a development project that is the subject of a development agreement, or within a high intensity area of opportunity, the applicant shall submit a master land use conceptual area plan in lieu of a detailed site plan. City council approval of the master plan shall be required. Conditions from any adopted district, corridor, or area plan, including the comprehensive plan shall be adopted as part of the approval where appropriate.

The adequacy of a meeting held or report filed pursuant to this section shall be considered by the city council but shall not be subject to judicial review. 
Sec. 18-229. - Approval of conditional zoning district. 
    Conditional zoning district decisions are a legislative process subject to judicial review using the same procedures and standard of review applicable to general use district zoning decisions. In considering any petition for a conditional zoning district, the council shall act in accordance with section 18-120, action by city council. Conditional zoning district decisions shall be made in consideration of identified relevant adopted land use plans for the area, including, but not limited to, comprehensive plans, strategic plans, district plans, area plans, neighborhood plans, corridor plans, and other land use policy documents. 
    The city council may not vote to rezone property to a conditional zoning district during the time period beginning on the date of a municipal general election and concluding on the date immediately following the date on which the city council holds its organizational meeting following a municipal general election unless no person spoke against the rezoning at the public hearing and no valid protest petition under G.S. § 160A-386 was filed. If a valid protest petition under G.S. § 160A-386 has been filed against a zoning petition which would otherwise have been scheduled for a public hearing during the period beginning on the first day of October prior to a municipal general election, but prior to the new city council taking office, then the public hearing on such petition and any decision on such petition shall both be postponed until after the new city council takes office. 
Sec. 18-230. - Conditions to approval of petition. 
    In approving a petition for the reclassification of property to a conditional zoning district, the planning commission may recommend, and the city council request, that reasonable and appropriate conditions be attached to approval of the petition. Any such conditions should relate to the relationship of the proposed use to surrounding property, proposed support facilities such as parking areas and driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems, screening and buffer areas, the timing of development, street and right-of-way improvements, water and sewer improvements, stormwater drainage, the provision of open space, and other matters that the city council may find appropriate or the petitioner may propose. Such conditions to approval of the petition may include dedication to the city, Cape Fear Public Utility Authority, county or state, as appropriate, of any rights-of-way or easements for streets, water, sewer, or other public utilities necessary to serve the proposed development. The petitioner shall have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any such conditions prior to final action by the city council. If for any reason any condition for approval is found to be illegal or invalid or if the applicant should fail to accept any condition following approval, the approval of the site plan for the district shall be null and void and of no effect and proceedings shall be instituted to rezone the property to its previous zoning classification. 
(Ord. No. 0-2008-41, § 4, 6-3-08) 
Sec. 18-231. - Effect of approval. 
(a)  If a petition for conditional zoning is approved, the development and use of the property shall be governed by the predetermined ordinance requirements applicable to the district's classification, the approved site plan or master plan for the district, and any additional approved rules, regulations, and conditions, all of which shall constitute the zoning regulations for the approved district and are binding on the property as an amendment to these regulations and to the zoning maps. 
(b)  If a petition is approved, only those uses and structures indicated in the approved petition and site plan or land use area indicated on the master plan shall be allowed on the subject property. A change of location of the structures may be authorized pursuant to section 18-232, alterations to approval. The changes to the site plan layout will not increase the number of structures. 
(c)  Following the approval of the petition for a conditional zoning district, the subject property shall be identified on the zoning maps by the appropriate district designation. A parallel conditional zoning shall be identified by the same designation as the underlying general district followed by the letters "CD" (for example "RB (CD)"). 
(d)  No permit shall be issued for any development activity within a conditional zoning district except in accordance with the approved petition and site plan for the district. 
(e)  Any violation of the approved site plan or any rules, regulations and conditions for the district shall be treated the same as any other violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the same remedies and penalties as any such violation. 
Sec. 18-232. - Alterations to approval. 
    Except as provided in subsection (b) below, changes to an approved petition or to the conditions attached to the approved petition shall be treated the same as amendments to these regulations or to the zoning maps and shall be processed in accordance with the procedures in this chapter. Any changes that would be considered major changes under section 18-89 herein shall be subject to this subsection. 
(a)  The city manager shall have the delegated authority to approve an administrative amendment to an approved site plan. The city manager shall have no authority to amend the conditions of approval of a petition. The standard for approving or denying such a requested change shall be that the change does not significantly alter the site plan and that the change does not have a significant impact upon abutting properties. An administrative amendment shall not be subject to a protest petition pursuant to section 18-121. Any decision must be in writing stating the grounds for approval or denial. 
(b)  The city manager, however, shall always have the discretion to decline to exercise the delegated authority either because he is uncertain about approval of the change pursuant to the standard or because a rezoning petition for a public hearing and city council consideration is deemed appropriate under the circumstances. If the city manager declines to exercise this authority, then the applicant can only file a rezoning petition for a public hearing and council decision. 
(c)  Any request for an administrative amendment shall be pursuant to a written letter, signed by the property owner, detailing the requested change. Upon request, the applicant must provide any additional information that is requested. Upon an approval of an administrative amendment, the applicant must file a sufficient number of copies of a revised site plan as deemed necessary by the city manager. 
Sec. 18-233. - Review of approval of a conditional zoning district. 
    It is intended that property shall be reclassified to a conditional zoning district only in the event of firm plans to develop the property. Therefore, no sooner than three (3) years after the date of approval of the petition, the planning commission may examine the progress made toward developing the property in accordance with the approved petition and any conditions attached to the approval. If the planning commission determines that progress has not been made in accordance with the approved petition and conditions, the planning commission shall forward to the city council a report which may recommend that the property be rezoned to its previous zoning classification or to another district.

(a)  Height limitations: Towers may not exceed the maximum height permitted in the zoning district by more than twenty (20) feet, except pursuant to a special use permit, except for concealed, stealth or camouflaged towers, which must comply with section 18-259(n). Under no circumstances shall a tower be allowed to be constructed which is over three hundred (300) feet in height. 
Airport Industrial (AI) District: In the AI District, communication facilities, including radio and TV stations, cellular telephone facilities, towers, etc., are not allowed above the height limitation established for the district by the Airport Height Zoning Ordinance. 
(b)  Site plan: No tower may be constructed or permitted without a set of plans bearing a licensed professional engineer's seal having first been filed with the city manager. 
(c)  Corridor Overlay District: Towers which are located on lots which are governed by a corridor overlay zone, shall also observe the use limitations imposed by the applicable overlay district. Towers located in overlay districts shall comply with the regulations contained in the underlying zoning district regulations as well as the overlay district regulations. Where there is a conflict, the more stringent regulation shall apply. 
(d)  Setbacks: Any tower shall have a setback equal to one hundred (100) percent of the tower height from any adjacent property line or principal structure and, in addition, all supporting cables and anchors shall be contained within the property or site on which the tower is located. If the tower is a monopole, any setback from principal structures or adjacent property lines shall equal sixty (60) percent of their height; provided that this requirement may be waived by written consent of the affected property owner or occupant of any principal structure (if different from the property owner). The required setback may be reduced if a licensed professional engineer certifies that the tower fall-zone will not exceed the setback area should the tower fail. The form of the waiver shall be subject to review by the city attorney and a notice of waiver shall be filed with the register of deeds prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(e)  Spacing: No tower may be constructed closer than fifteen hundred (1,500) feet to any other tower. This distance shall be measured by following a straight line from the centerline of the base of the proposed tower to the centerline of the base of the existing tower; however, if a cellular communication provider can prove that no other space is available on an existing tower or surrounding structure or that an existing tower structure will not technically satisfy the specific needs of the applicant and provides an affidavit or other evidence to this effect, a variance from the board of adjustment can be requested only for a portion of the fifteen hundred-foot spacing requirement contained in this section. 
(f)  Buffering requirements: The base of the tower, any guy wires, and any associated equipment, structures, shelters, cabinets, generators, or platforms shall be surrounded by a fence when all adjacent properties are zoned nonresidential. When an adjacent property is residentially zoned or used or is within view of a right-of-way, a buffer shall be provided on all sides of the base of the tower, any guy wires, and any associated equipment, including structures, shelters, cabinets, generators, or platforms. The buffer shall be installed surrounding the compound with a combination of a solid fence and ten (10) feet of landscape area. Plantings shall consist, at a minimum, of one (1) tree of the size specified in section 18-448 every fifteen (15) linear feet. If the lot on which the tower is placed contains existing vegetation sufficient to provide opacity to the adjacent parcels, then the buffer may be reduced as determined by the city manager; however, once a tower is constructed, the required landscaping around the base of the tower shall be reviewed by the city manager for each future collocation to ensure replacement of dead or missing vegetation. 
(g)  Roof-top towers: Such towers if located on the top of buildings or structures shall be no more than thirty (30) percent of the building/structure height above the building/structure or fifty (50) feet above the building/structure, whichever is less. Such towers shall not require a special use permit; however, those subsections of these regulations that govern EMF emissions and reception interference shall be followed. 
(h)  Collocation: Any tower that is between one hundred sixteen (116) feet and one hundred eighty (180) feet in height shall be constructed to permit the collocation of one (1) additional user. Any tower which exceeds one hundred eighty (180) feet in height shall be constructed to allow a minimum of two (2) additional uses. To further encourage collocation, additional users and associated equipment which do not add to the height of the tower or area of the compound, may be added without additional approval. 
The applicant or property owner shall provide documentation from a licensed professional engineer that the tower has sufficient structural integrity to accommodate the required number of additional users as stated above. Additionally, a statement shall be submitted by the tower's owner regarding the intent of the owner to allow shared use of the tower and how many other uses can be accommodated on the tower. 
Any applicant for construction of a new tower shall provide evidence to the city demonstrating that the applicant cannot co-locate its proposed facilities on any existing tower. 
(i)  Lighting: When lighting for a tower is required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), it shall consist of a red light at night and strobes in the day. The lighting shall be oriented so as not to project directly onto surrounding residential properties. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the owner of the tower shall provide documentation from the FAA that the lighting is the minimum lighting required by the FAA. 
(j)  Electromagnetic field (EMF) emissions: The tower owner shall provide documentation indicating that the power density levels do not exceed federally approved levels of electromagnetic radiation or American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards, whichever provides the stricter requirements. 
(k)  Reception interference: EMF emissions and tower profiles shall not interfere with radio and television reception in the vicinity of the tower. 
(l)  Signs: No sign shall be permitted on the antennas or support structures unless required by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the City of Wilmington, or New Hanover County. 
(m)  Removal of towers: Towers which are not used for a period of six (6) months or more shall be removed by the owner within ninety (90) days following written notice from the city. Towers which are not maintained for a period of six (6) months or more shall be removed by the owner within ninety (90) days following written notice from the city. To comply with these regulations, the owner of the tower must provide evidence to the city from the FCC that the tower is still in use and any evidence the city manager may deem necessary to show the tower has been maintained in accordance with all applicable building code regulations. 
To assure the removal of towers which do not meet the requirements for use or maintenance, a performance bond shall be posted for each tower by the tower owner prior to the issuance of a building permit. The amount of the performance bond shall be submitted by the tower owner and reviewed and determined for sufficiency by the city engineer. Removal costs shall be charged to the tower owner and if not paid, then it shall be charged against the performance bond. 
(n)  Regulations for concealed, stealth or camouflaged towers: A concealed, stealth or camouflaged communication tower which is a tower designed to blend in with its surroundings including, but not limited to, antennae located in a structure such as within a church steeple, or a bell tower a unipole with the antennae and attachments hidden within a single pole or attached to a water tower. New construction of a stealth unipole tower shall be permitted up to one hundred fifty (150) feet in height. Construction of a unipole greater than one hundred fifty (150) feet in height requires issuance of a special use permit. If meeting the definition of a concealed, stealth or camouflaged communication tower requires any addition to an existing structure, any modification to any architectural feature of a structure or the construction of a structure to conceal or help camouflage a communication tower, the planning staff shall review the plans for such changes or new construction prior to any permit being issued. If the addition or modification involves only the installation of antennae without increasing the height or changing the appearance of the existing structure, a special use permit shall not be required. In reviewing such plans, considerations shall include whether the addition, feature or new construction is architecturally harmonious in such aspects as material, height, proportion, bulk, scale and design with the building complex or surroundings of which it is part. If it is a stand-alone structure, the structure and all associated equipment shall be reviewed as to whether the structure is harmonious with the surrounding area. If a plan is denied by the city manager, this decision may be appealed to the board of adjustment. 
(o)  Towers, antenna, and other associated equipment including cables and wires placed on existing structures in the 1945 corporate limits shall be harmonious with the architecture of the building and shall be disguised to the greatest extent possible. 
(p)  Reasonable accommodation of amateur radio antennas: Notwithstanding the forgoing rules, regulation of amateur radio antennas and support structures for amateur radio antennas shall be in accordance with G.S. Art. 19, § 160A-383.3. 
(q)  Existing communication tower modifications. The city manager may not deny, and shall approve, any minor modification of an existing wireless communication tower and facility that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such wireless communication tower. A minor modification is further defined [as] follows: 
(1)  An increase in the existing vertical height of the communication tower by no more than ten (10) percent or the height of one (1) additional antenna array, with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed twenty (20) feet. 
(2)  No appurtenance to the body of a wireless support structure shall protrude horizontally from the edge of the wireless support structure (i) more than twenty (20) feet or (ii) more than the width of the wireless support structure at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater. 
Exceptions to this rule may apply where necessary to shelter the antenna from inclement weather or to connect the antenna to the communication tower via cable. 
(3)  An increase in the square footage of the existing equipment compound by no more than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet.

Sec. 18-278. - Historic mixed use buildings. 
    Historic mixed use buildings are established specifically as a method of historic preservation efforts for buildings meeting the criteria established herein. Further, the designation and permitting of historic mixed use buildings is not intended to allow the proliferation of mixed uses in the residential districts, and should not at any time be permitted in the established Historic District-Residential. 
    Buildings located within the 1945 corporate limits that meet the criteria listed below are permitted by right to combine residential uses and limited nonresidential uses in the same structure in the CB, CS and O&I zoning districts. In the R-3 and R-5 zoning districts they are permitted by special use permit only. Historic mixed use buildings must meet the following criteria: 
(a)  Have been constructed for nonresidential or mixed use purposes and be fifty (50) years old or older and considered eligible for National Register of Historic Places listing, or 
(b)  Have been constructed for nonresidential or mixed use purposes and be located within the boundaries of the National Register Historic District and considered contributing resources. (See inventory list from the 1999-2000 Architectural Survey and/or applicable National Register nominations.) 
(c)  Buildings originally constructed for the specific purpose of exclusive residential use shall not be eligible for mixed use building provisions. If there is any doubt about the original intended purpose of the building, then it is the responsibility of the applicant to provide conclusive evidence of original use as nonresidential. Buildings constructed as residences that housed accessory uses that are clearly incidental and subordinate to the residential uses, such as doctors' offices, boarding houses, home occupations or any other use accessory to the residential purpose are not eligible for this use. 
(d)  Buildings proposed for mixed uses must retain the original, character-defining exterior architectural features. Original or early exterior features of mixed use buildings may be repaired, but not altered. Removal of exterior additions, features or materials not original and not appropriate to the building is permitted. When replacement of existing architectural features is necessary, such as doors, windows or roofs, replacement materials must match the existing in material texture, size, shape, color, scale and dimension. Additions to existing structures are allowed but can not exceed fifty (50) percent of the overall square footage of the original building. Further, additions must be placed in the rear or side of the building and can not exceed the height of the lowest component of the existing roof line. 
(e)  Uses. Each building proposing mixed uses shall have a minimum of two (2) uses (one (1) residential, one (1) nonresidential) included in one (1) structure. A minimum of one (1) use must be dedicated for residential use. For uses in the mixed use building, at least fifty (50) percent of the total square footage must be devoted to a use permitted in the zoning district where it is located and such use shall conform to the permitted use list of this chapter. 
(1)  Residential uses (including home occupations) are permitted in mixed use buildings. 
(2)  The following nonresidential uses are permitted in mixed use buildings: 
a.  Artist's studio. 
b.  Banking and financial institutions, no drive-up windows.

Sec. 18-279. - Home occupation. 
    Home occupations are permitted, provided: 
(a)  Only one (1) person other than members of the family residing on the premises shall be engaged in such occupation. 
(b)  The use of the dwelling unit for the home occupation shall be clearly incidental and subordinate to its use for residential purposes by its occupants; up to twenty-five (25) percent of the floor area of the dwelling unit, but in no case more than four hundred (400) square feet, may be used in the conduct of the home occupation. This restriction does not apply to the bed and breakfast use (see subsection (k)(3) below). 
(c)  There shall be no change in the outside appearance of the building or premises, or other visible evidence of the conduct of such home occupation other than one (1) sign, not exceeding two and one-fourth (21/4) square feet in area, nonilluminated and mounted flat against the wall of the principal building.

(f)  No equipment or process shall be used in such home occupation which creates noise, vibration, glare, fumes or electrical interference detectable to the normal senses off the lot, if the occupation is conducted in a single-family housing unit, or outside the housing unit if conducted in other than a single-family housing unit. In the case of electrical interference, no equipment or process shall be used which creates visual or audible interference in any radio or television receivers off the premises, or causes fluctuations in line voltage off the premises. For bed and breakfast establishments, no cooking facilities are permitted in the individual guest rooms. 
(g)  No display of products shall be visible from the street. The selling or manufacturing of merchandise, except baking, sewing and/or home crafts normally made in the home, is prohibited and therefore cannot be the function of the home occupation; 
(h)  Except for bed and breakfast establishments, home occupations shall be limited to no more than five (5) patrons per day. 
(i)  No entrance or exit way shall be specifically provided in the dwelling or on the premises for the conduct of the home occupation.

(4)  No off-street parking is required. 
(5)  The use provisions of this section are not subject to variance by the board of adjustment.

(O-2015-31, § 13, 5-5-15) 
Sec. 18-327. - Single-family courtyard developments. 
    Single-family courtyard development is a type of detached housing providing small residences for smaller households. This housing type is provided as part of the city's overall housing strategy, which seeks to meet the needs of a population diverse in age, income, household composition, and individual needs through encouraging a variety of housing types and price points, innovation and variety in housing design and site development. These developments are intended to foster a strong sense of community through shared use of common space. 
    Development standards for single-family courtyards are intended to create a small community of homes oriented around open space (courtyard) that is pedestrian-oriented, provides for pedestrian amenities, minimizes the visibility of off-street parking, and takes advantage of natural features on the site. The development standards are intended to maintain the traditional amenities and proportions associated with these pocket neighborhoods while ensuring that these housing developments contribute to the overall community character. Courtyard developments typically allow higher densities than are allowed in the underlying zoning districts. This increased density is possible through the use of smaller than average home sizes, clustered parking, and site design standards. Courtyard housing developments are encouraged to use low-impact development techniques to the greatest extent possible. 
    Performance standards for housing unit density, separation between developments, impervious surface areas, building heights and sizes are employed in cottage developments to improve predictability in the design, review, and approach of such projects. These standards also reduce the impacts of increased density, prevent overbuilding of the site, and limit the amount of off-street parking necessary to serve the development. Because of the limited building size and typically smaller household size, parking requirements are reduced; parking should be designed to minimize visibility from the street. 
    Development of single-family courtyard housing is a voluntary development pattern in the R-20, R-15, R-10, R-7, R-5, and R-3 zoning districts. Within the R-20 and R-15 districts, a special use permit is required. Submission of a single-family courtyard development plan for review and approval by the subdivision review board shall constitute voluntary owner consent for this optional development pattern. 
(a)  Permitted uses. The uses allowed in each district as described in this chapter are allowed in the cottage developments option of the R-20, R-15, R-10, R-7, R-5, and R-3 zoning districts, except that the following uses shall be prohibited: 
(1)  Golf courses, private or public, with related services, including pro-shop. 
(2)  Parks and recreation areas, municipal. 
(3)  Governmental uses outside public rights-of-way, except offices. 
(4)  Libraries. 
(5)  Religious institutions. 
(6)  Telecommunication facility, unattended. 
(7)  Property-restricted real estate sales office. 
(8)  Accessory apartments, attached or detached. 
(9)  Kennels, private. 
(10)  Schools, primary, secondary, university and college. 
(11)  Duplex, triplex, quadraplex. 
(12)  Bed and breakfast. 
(13)  University administrative offices. 
(14)  Day care, adult or child. 
(b)  Development Standards. 
(1)  Courtyard developments are intended to foster a sense of community and shared common spaces. To help achieve this, courtyard dwelling units shall be developed in clusters or pods of at least four (4) but no more than twelve (12) dwelling units per cluster. Multiple clusters may be developed within a single courtyard development. 
Lot dimensions: 
R-20 and R-15 R-10 R-7 R-5 R-3 Minimum lot size (parent parcel) for 4 dwelling units 1 acre 40,000 
square feet 22,000

or 1 block, whichever is greater 1,000 feet 
or 1 block, whichever is greater 1,000 feet 
or 1 block, whichever is greater  
(2)  Central courtyard open space. Each courtyard cluster must be oriented around a courtyard or common central open space, which is critical to the design of any single-family courtyard development. Each dwelling unit shall have the primary orientation toward this central open space. For the purpose of single-family courtyard housing developments, common courtyard open space shall be a central space that may be used by all occupants of the housing cluster. 
a.  A minimum of five hundred (500) square feet of open space per dwelling unit shall be allocated to each cluster's central open space. 
b.  No common central open space shall have a dimension less than thirty (30) feet. Parking areas, yard setbacks, required setback areas, private open space, and driveways do not qualify as common open space. 
c.  Pedestrian connectivity shall be provided through each central courtyard open space. An improved pedestrian path or sidewalk from each cottage dwelling unit to the pedestrian facilities of the central courtyard open space shall be provided. 
d.  Above-ground stormwater control measures shall not be placed in the central courtyard. 
(3)  Dimensional and orientation requirements. 
a.  Maximum building height shall be thirty-five (35) feet. Structures in courtyard housing developments shall be designed to be single-story, single-story plus a loft, or two-story. 
b.  Front porches. All cottage dwelling units shall be provided with a covered main entry porch to create a private outdoor space protected from the weather and provide a transition from the interior private residential space to the semi-public outdoor space. Covered porches shall be usable in both design and dimension. 
i.  Homes shall have a covered main entry porch with a floor area measuring at least seventy-five (75) square feet in area. 
ii.  The floor of the covered main entry porch shall have minimum dimensions of not less than eight (8) feet in any direction (length or width). 
c.  Building Orientation. Any structure with a street-facing facade shall contribute to the neighborhood through the use of windows, changes in materials and/or color, and views of front doors or porches. The primary orientation and front porch of some cottages may be visible from adjacent streets to provide a visual pedestrian connection with the surrounding neighborhood. All dwelling units shall be oriented to avoid blank walls or appear to have a "back" towards streets or common courtyard open spaces. Garages shall not be oriented towards the common courtyard open space, a primary street, or towards the front facade of any other courtyard dwelling unit. 
d.  Lot configuration. Courtyard housing may be developed on individual lots or with a common form of ownership (townhouse or condominium-style), with all units within a development on a single lot. In either case, street frontage is only required for the parent parcel and not for each dwelling unit. When a courtyard development is subdivided for multiple ownership, a community property owner's association shall be established in accordance with the subdivision ordinance. 
e.  Dwelling unit floor area. The heated ground floor area of any dwelling unit may not exceed one thousand one hundred (1,100) square feet. Covered porches shall not be included in the calculation of floor area. An engaged garage (a garage that is under the same roof as the dwelling area and serves only the dwelling unit to which it is attached) shall not be included in the calculation of the floor area; however, the total square footage of an engaged garage shall not exceed one-third ( 1/3 ) of the gross heated ground floor area of the dwelling unit or three hundred (300) square feet, whichever is less. 
f.  Building setbacks. Regardless of whether courtyard developments are developed on individual lots or developed on a single parent parcel, setbacks from the front, side, and rear parent parcel lines shall be consistent with those of the zoning district 
i.  The subdivision review board may approve variations from these setbacks to allow front yard averaging along public streets, to maximize preservation of significant trees, or to take advantage of unique site and topography features. 
ii.  The minimum distance between buildings within a courtyard development shall be six (6) feet. 
iii.  Dwelling units should be setback at least six (6) feet, but no more than eighteen (18) feet, from the common courtyard open space. 
(4)  Trees and landscaping. Courtyard developments shall be designed to incorporate existing trees and natural features into the site design according to the regulations found in this section rather than Article 8 of this chapter. 
a.  New trees shall be located to create amenities in the common courtyard open space and within private open spaces, to provide shade where appropriate, to enhance separation between buildings where desired, and to screen and soften the perimeter of parking areas and street-facing sides of cottage housing developments. 
b.  There shall be a minimum of two (2) canopy trees per dwelling unit in each cluster. This requirement may be satisfied by the preservation of existing canopy trees or by planting new canopy trees on site. 
c.  In the R-20 district and within identified resource protection areas, buildings shall be located so as to maximize natural stormwater functions. Buildings shall be clustered and parking areas shall be located to preserve as much contiguous, permanently undeveloped open space and native vegetation as possible. 
d.  Foundation plantings. Foundation plantings shall be installed around each building within a courtyard development along any exposed building foundation of a building facade, except where the building facade directly abuts a sidewalk or other hardscape feature. 
i.  All street-facing foundations shall have landscaping consisting primarily of shrubs, perennials, and native grasses. 
ii.  In instances where a porch, stoop, or other architectural building element protrudes from the building structure, the landscaped area may be along the outer edge of the element rather than the foundation. 
iii.  Buildings with facades (front or rear) that face a courtyard, street, or driveway shall plant one (1) shrub for every five (5) linear feet of facade. 
iv.  Foundation plantings shall be planted within five (5) feet of the building foundation or architectural element. 
(5)  Low-impact development. As soils allow, courtyard developments shall be designed to take advantage of open space, landscaped features, and natural areas to utilize low-impact development techniques, including natural filtration and on-site infiltration of stormwater. 
(6)  Parking. The placement, location, and design of off-street parking shall be designed to minimize the visual and physical impacts of parking on the courtyard development and to maintain a pedestrian character for the overall development. Off-street parking shall be located and designed to be less visible from frontage streets than the cottages themselves. Off-street parking shall be located to the side or rear of dwelling units and shall not be located between dwelling units and the primary street frontage. If it is determined by the Subdivision Review Board that another design solution may meet these objectives, strict compliance with the location of parking may be waived. 
a.  For the purposes of this section, "parking areas" are where two (2) or more off-street parking spaces are adjacent. 
b.  Any portion of the central courtyard open space within thirty-five (35) feet of a parking space shall not be counted towards the minimum courtyard space requirement. 
c.  The number of dwelling units immediately adjacent to parking areas shall be less than the number of units not located adjacent to parking areas. 
d.  Parking lot landscaping shall be installed to provide one (1) canopy tree per two (2) parking spaces to provide shade (in addition to the trees and landscaping requirements above). This requirement may be satisfied with existing trees or new trees. 
e.  For a depth of forty (40) feet from the street frontage of the parent parcel, driveways and parking spaces shall consume not more than one-third ( 1/3 ) of the total lot width. 
f.  No more than one-third ( 1/3 ) of the total number of dwelling units may be serviced by a private driveway or engaged garage. For example, if there are nine (9) units in a development, no more than three (3) of the cottage dwelling units may have a private driveway or engaged garage. 
g.  Parking areas shall be setback from parent parcel lines when adjacent to single-family zoned parcels. The subdivision review board may reduce the setback and buffer requirements when parking areas are adjacent to an alley. 
Zoning District Parking area setback Minimum vegetative buffer width R-3, R-5, R-7, R-10 15 feet 10 feet R-15, R-20 20 feet 15 feet  
h.  The requirements for off-street parking may be reduced by the subdivision review board if it can be demonstrated that sufficient on-street parking exists to meet the needs of the development. Parking shall not exceed the following ratios: 
Total heated area of dwelling unit Off-street parking spaces per dwelling unit (minimum/maximum) Up to 1,200 square feet 1 space/2 spaces 1,201 or more square feet 1.5 spaces/2.5 spaces

DIVISION II. - TEMPORARY USES 

Sec. 18-340. - General. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to recognize that there is a need for special allowances to be granted to certain temporary uses so that they may be permitted within the community. Because of the special problems related to temporary uses, it is also necessary to provide specific, separate and distinct guidelines and standards for them. It is the express intent of these provisions to minimize any potential adverse impact of such temporary uses by eliminating, to the greatest possible extent, any major problems, threats or dangers to the public health, safety or welfare as may exist with any or all of these temporary uses.

DIVISION III. - CONSERVATION RESOURCE REGULATIONS 

Sec. 18-341. - General. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the conservation resource regulations is to protect important environmental resources within the city. Protection of these resources is necessary to maintain the city's diverse and ecologically important natural systems; to preserve the city's estuarine systems important for fin fishing and shell fishing; to preserve natural open space; and to protect the resources critical to the city's economic development and tourism industry. The conservation resource regulations shall be in addition to any other regulations that may apply. In the event that the conservation resource regulations conflict with other regulations, the more stringent or higher standard shall control over the less stringent or lower standard. 
(b)  Applicability. The development and improvement of property, including the subdivision of land, shall be subject to these performance controls if the parcel is associated with a conservation resource as defined in this division. A parcel is considered to be associated with a conservation resource if either the resource is contained partially or wholly on the parcel or if the resource is located next to a parcel such that a resource setback as defined herein extends into the subject parcel. If a parcel contains a resource that was defined under any previous regulations in the county or city, then it is considered to be associated with a resource under these regulations and the standards herein shall apply. It is the responsibility of the applicant for a development approval to make all necessary investigations to determine if the parcel is associated with a conservation resource. The following uses and activities, however, are exempted from these controls: 
(1)  The construction of one (1) single-family detached structure or one (1) residential duplex, or the location of a manufactured home on a parcel or lot of less than one (1) acre unless the lot was part of a subdivision that was subject to conservation resource protections either under this division or any prior city or county conservation resource protection ordinances or regulations. The exemptions do not extend to any accessory structures. 
(2)  Commercial, industrial, office or institutional development on a parcel less than one (1) acre in area unless the development was part of a development or subdivision that was subject to conservation resource protections either under this division or any prior city or county conservation resource protection ordinances or regulations. 
(3)  The development or redevelopment of a parcel in the urban waterfront as defined by North Carolina Administrative Code 15 NCAC 07H.0209(g) that meets the following conditions: 
a.  To the extent practical, the project meets the baseline criteria of article 10 for exceptionally designed projects; 
b.  The project includes an extension of or connection to the Riverwalk consistent with city plans and design standards and meets ADA design standards along with a public access easement approved by the city attorney; 
c.  The project includes public access traversing the project connecting to the Riverwalk with easements approved by the city attorney spaced at intervals of approximately two hundred (200) feet, or intervals dictated by established or approved street patterns. These pedestrian ways must be landscaped and integrated with public spaces along the river front; and 
d.  The project contains a minimum of ten (10) percent pedestrian-oriented public space connected and integrated with the Riverwalk. Public spaces shall provide amenities for comfort and convenience for pedestrians such as seating, lighting, directional signage, bicycle racks and trash receptacles. 
(c)  Conservation resources. If a parcel is associated with any one (1) of the conservation resources listed below, then the parcel shall be subject to the performance controls of this division. The city manager shall determine the presence of conservation resources regulated under this division from available information, including information submitted by the applicant regarding actual delineation of the extent of resources existing on the site by a professional soil scientist, biologist or other natural resource professional qualified to identify and delineate such resources. Such determinations are subject to revision if made more than five (5) years prior to the date of application for a development approval and evidence exists that site conditions have changed due to the dynamics of wetland migration, shoreline erosion, sea level rise, or other factors. 
(1)  The following conservation resources are subject to this division (wetland types are based on the North Carolina Coastal Region Evaluation of Wetland Significance or NC CREWS): 
a.  Headwater swamp/swamp forest wetlands 
b.  Pocosin wetlands 
c.  Savannah wetlands 
d.  Natural or naturalized ponds 
e.  Freshwater marsh 
f.  Salt/brackish marsh 
g.  Primary nursery areas 
h.  Animal and plant natural areas of special significance 
Except for the uses exempted from the controls in this division, if a parcel is associated with any one (1) of the conservation resources described herein, no permit shall be issued for grading and clearing, tree removal or other land disturbing activities, including permits issued under the New Hanover County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance or article 8, division III, of this chapter unless the conservation resources as defined in this division have been delineated by a qualified natural resource professional as described herein and the conservation resources will be protected consistent with the terms of this division and are shown with associated buffers and setbacks on the site plan. Except as exempted herein, no person, directly or indirectly, shall engage in a land-disturbing activity or remove any tree from public or private property except in compliance with this division. 
(d)  General performance controls for conservation resources. The following general performance controls shall apply to all development associated with a conservation resource that is subject to this division. 
(1)  Protection. Conservation resources shall be permanently protected. 
(2)  Improvements. A conservation resource shall not be cleared of vegetation, shall not have natural drainage system(s) significantly altered and shall not be developed in any manner that would negatively impact the conservation resource, except under the following conditions: 
a.  Improvements that would either protect or enhance the enjoyment of the conservation resource. Such measures not causing significant impact include uncovered walkways, self-guided trails, protective fences, uncovered docks and boat ramps and improvements of similar nature and/or degree of disturbance. 
b.  Access to other parts of the parcel. If part of the parcel could be developed, but would be inaccessible due to the existence of a conservation resource, a road and/or utilities may be constructed through the conservation resource. The road and/or utilities, however, shall cross at the narrowest practical point and shall be designed and constructed to the greatest extent practical to minimize impact to the conservation resource. 
c.  Access to the waterfront. If the entire waterfront along a parcel is inaccessible due to the existence of a conservation resource(s), a boat ramp or uncovered pier may be built for boating facilities in the conservation resource, subject to relevant state and federal permits. The facilities, however, shall be designed and constructed to the greatest extent practical to minimize impact to the conservation resource(s). 
d.  Mitigated impacts permitted by the U.S. Army Corps of engineers for infrastructure improvements. 
(3)  Methods of conservation resource preservation. Conservation resources shall remain undivided and shall be permanently preserved by conservation easements, protective covenants, or similar restrictions or by any of the procedures for the dedication of park, recreation, and open space areas set forth in section 18-383(e) of this Code. 
(4)  Stormwater runoff. Runoff from impervious surfaces on any part of the parcel shall not be discharged directly into natural water bodies or conservation resources without vegetated filtration and energy dissipation of a length equal to the length of the required conservation resource setback. Runoff shall be routed along vegetated swales, through filter media of vegetation, gravel, sand, or other media, or to bioretention units, constructed wetlands, infiltration devices, detention ponds or other approved devices for purposes of increasing percolation, settling and filtering out of pollutants and decreasing discharge velocity and volume. 
(5)  Setbacks. All structures and impervious surfaces shall be set back from the conservation resource (whether the resource is located on the parcel or on an adjacent parcel) the minimum distance from the edge of the resource as specified in the conservation resource setback table set out below. The conservation resource setback shall be subject to the following: 
a.  Improvements may be permitted to encroach into the conservation resource setbacks up to twenty-five (25) percent of the buildable area exclusive of other required setbacks provided the following conditions are met: 
i.  All runoff from any impervious surface is infiltrated or otherwise treated so as to not impact the resource by using a stormwater treatment device designed to infiltrate runoff from the one-year 24-hour storm; or 
ii.  Where soils allow, pervious pavement is used with sub-base infiltration capacity designed to be equivalent to the required protection; or 
iii.  Any structure has a vegetated roof constructed in accordance with the state BMP manual; 
iv.  The encroachment at no point extends to within one-half (1/2) the distance to the edge of the resource. 
b.  If an expansion or new impervious surface encroaches into the setback on a lot with an existing encroachment, the existing encroachment must be included in the area that requires treatment in accordance with this section. 
c.  An encroachment of five hundred (500) square feet or less may be mitigated by treating runoff from a nonencroaching impervious area located elsewhere on the lot, provided it also drains to the resource. The proposed treatment mitigation must be determined by the city manager to provide equivalent or better protection. 
d.  Any treatment device used to meet the requirements of this section shall be designed in accordance with the Land Development Code stormwater requirements and Technical Standards and Specifications Manual including recordation of maintenance requirements and necessary easements. 
e.  Decks may be allowed to encroach into the conservation resource setback up to six (6) feet. Raised walkways six (6) feet or less in width may encroach into the conservation resource setback. Encroaching portions of walkways and decks shall be uncovered and constructed so that the floorboards are spaced to allow water to flow through directly to the ground. The ground below the walkway or deck shall be left undisturbed or planted with ground cover or other vegetation. 
f.  A covered deck or gazebo that is constructed in common ownership of any property owners' association may be permitted provided it is no larger than one hundred forty-four (144) square feet and is raised a minimum of two (2) feet above natural vegetation. 
g.  In the event that a new delineation of a conservation resource on a previously subdivided parcel as required in subsection 18-341(c) shows that the resource encroached into the lot reducing its buildable area by fifty (50) percent or more, then front and side setbacks may be reduced by up to one-half (1/2) of the total setback width or the conservation resource setback may be reduced by up to one-half (1/2) of its depth along no more than one-half (1/2) of the length of the setback.

(e)  Vegetated buffer controls for conservation resources. 
(1)  Purpose and intent. The establishment of a vegetated buffer is intended to promote high water quality in the creeks and sounds, to protect the public health and to ensure the protection of the natural resources within the City of Wilmington. 
A properly vegetated buffer is essential to filter and biologically process nutrient rich runoff, animal wastes, and sediment before it enters coastal creeks, canals, and rivers. Buffers also function to moderate water temperatures, maintain the desired dissolved oxygen levels in the water, and stabilize the soils immediately adjoining the stream. In urban environments, the function of a buffer is especially critical to the balance of the plant and animal life in fresh and saltwater creeks. Buffers are most effective when they contain native and naturalized plants appropriate in size, adaptability (salt tolerance, wind tolerance, etc.) and hardiness for the area. Plants requiring intensive or routine maintenance should be avoided in buffer areas. 
(2)  Applicability. A portion of the conservation resource setback shall be maintained as a vegetated buffer if a parcel is associated with any of the following conservation resources: salt marsh, brackish marsh, freshwater marsh, wetlands contiguous with tidal wetlands, tidal shores and/or primary nursery areas. 
(3)  Standards. 
a.  Buffer measurement. Buffers shall extend thirty-five (35) feet measured horizontally from the edge of the conservation resource and on a line perpendicular to and landward of the conservation resource. 
b.  Recordation. Buffers shall be delineated on recorded plats along with enumeration of maintenance requirements as defined in this division. 
c.  Plant materials in the buffer. The plant material in the buffer must be either retained in a natural, minimally disturbed condition, or properly managed in accordance with the management standards set forth in this division. In cases where vegetation does not exist within the buffer, the city shall require restoration efforts, including but not limited to, replanting of the vegetated buffer with plant species as recommended in the City of Wilmington Technical Standards and Specifications Manual. 
d.  Development activities within the buffer. Development activities within the buffer are limited to water dependent structures, except as otherwise provided in this division. Examples of water dependent structures include docks, piers, boat ramps, navigation markers, and access channels. Shoreline stabilization structures may be allowed no closer than the upland edge of the buffer except that properly designed and permitted living shoreline stabilization features may be allowed within the conservation resource or associated buffer. In order to maintain the functional value of the buffer, excavation, grading, filling and ditching are not permitted except as otherwise provided herein. 
e.  Public recreational facilities within the buffer. Passive public recreational facilities such as pervious trails and pathways, where owned by public entities or property owners' associations, or where public access easements have been granted, may be permitted within the buffer.

i.  Shoreline access paths: Pathways which provide access to the shoreline are permissible provided they are a maximum average of six (6) feet in width and follow a path that minimizes erosion within the buffer. Pathways may be vegetated with grasses and mowed, or may be surfaces such as crushed stone, shell, or mulch. Elevated wooden walkways and stairs up to six (6) feet in width may also be used, as long as there is spacing between decking boards and the walkway is elevated a minimum of two (2) feet to provide for light penetration and rainwater to drip through to allow for continued vegetation growth. 
ii.  View corridor: Selective thinning and pruning of natural vegetation within the buffer may be allowed to provide for site lines and vistas of the shoreline. Alteration of the natural vegetation as provided in this division is permitted. Removal of native vegetation for planting of nonnative grasses or other exotic or invasive species is prohibited. 
iii.  Safety and welfare: Selective tree removal and thinning and pruning of natural vegetation within the buffer zone will be allowed for safety and welfare concerns (e.g., removal of damaged tree(s) close enough to a dwelling that it poses a strike hazard). A permit shall be required for the removal of any tree(s) within the buffer or the conservation resource. 
iv.  Shoreline erosion control: For necessary shoreline erosion control projects, trees and woody vegetation may be removed and the erosion control measure employed in a manner that is consistent with the purpose and intent of this division. Areas cleared for erosion control measures may be required to be revegetated with plant species as recommended in the City of Wilmington Technical Standards and Specifications Manual. 
v.  Habitat and species management: Management of natural vegetation within the buffer to enhance wildlife habitat and to remove nuisance and non-native invasive species may be allowed. 
g.  Buffer encroachments. Buffers may be encroached upon by public roads, bridges and utilities where no practical alternative exists. These structures shall be designed consistent with the purpose and intent of this division employing best management practices to minimize impacts to the resource and shall require post-construction restoration. 
(f)  Savings provision. The conservation resource regulations in this division shall not affect any pending litigation or appeals involving the city's former conservation overlay district regulations (prior LDC section 18-215 et seq.). The conservation resource regulations shall not apply to any site plan application accepted by the city at the time of the adoption of this division; provided, however, the applicant submits all documentation required for approval within two (2) years of the date of the completion of any pending litigation or the date of the site plan acceptance, whichever is the later date.

All proposed streets which have been designated as public streets in accordance with paragraph (b) above shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual. Streets which are proposed for inclusion on the state system shall, in addition, require approval of the NCDOT in accordance with the provisions of G.S. § 136-102.6. 
(d)  Private streets. Streets designated as private in accordance with paragraph (b) above may be allowed in subdivisions when, in the opinion of the subdivision review board, they provide adequate ingress and egress onto collector streets, and they provide sufficient assurance through legally established homeowners or similar owners' associations, deed restrictions, and/or covenants, or other maintenance agreements, that said street shall be properly maintained and said agreements perpetually carried with the land. The subdivision review board shall reserve the authority, when the public welfare and safety warrant, to require the public dedication of street rights-of-way within developments. All private streets shall be designed and constructed to meet or exceed the public street standards as specified by the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual. 
(e)  Subdivision street disclosure statement. Prior to entering any agreement regarding the sale of a house or lot in a subdivision, the buyer must receive a subdivision street disclosure statement. Said disclosure statement shall fully and completely disclose the status (whether public or private) of the street upon which the house or lot fronts. If the street is designated by the subdivider as a public street, the statement shall certify that the design and construction of said street meets or exceeds city standards and, if applicable, has been approved by the district highway engineer. If the street has been designated as a private street by the subdivider, the statement shall, in addition to certifying the compliance with city standards, explain the consequences and responsibility as to maintenance of private streets and shall fully and accurately disclose the individuals upon whom responsibility for maintenance of such streets shall rest. Written acknowledgement of receipt of the disclosure statement by the buyer shall be conclusive proof of delivery thereof. 
(f)  Street classification. Streets shall be installed in accordance with the appropriate design standards for their street class, as specified in the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual. Use of the "local street" class within subdivisions for access to individual lots is recommended and in most instances will be desirable to the subdivider by providing an adequate, yet economical, facility for access. Local street systems shall be designed to accommodate their use by through traffic. However, design of streets shall be such to discourage excessive use of residential streets for through traffic. Excessive shall be interpreted to be only those instances where a local street would carry a volume of cars per day greater than one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of its estimated capacity. However, when, in the opinion of the subdivision review board, the design of a local street, as delineated on the subdivision plat, will encourage and/or increase through traffic beyond the capacity of a general local street, the street shall be reclassified to the appropriate higher classification and said street shall be designed and constructed to meet the standards of the reassigned classification. 
(g)  Subdivisions within planned thoroughfare or collector street corridors. In order to minimize the impacts of thoroughfare and collector street development and in order to facilitate a collaborative design process for the alignments of thoroughfares and collector streets, the owner or subdivider of a property that is associated with (e.g., adjacent to or contains) a proposed major thoroughfare or collector street, must prepare a sketch plan for review and approval prior to the submission of a preliminary plat. In addition to the standard requirements for sketch plan the subdivider shall request in writing a meeting at least sixty (60) days prior to the scheduled sketch plan review. 
(h)  Reserved. 
(i)  Access to adjacent properties. The arrangement of streets in proposed subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of existing streets in adjoining areas or their proper projection where adjoining land is not subdivided and where they may be deemed necessary for public requirements. For large subdivisions adjacent to large tracts of unsubdivided property, street projections shall be required into the adjacent unsubdivided tracts at a maximum distance of every one thousand (1,000) feet. The street arrangement shall be such as not to cause a hardship to owners of adjoining property when developed and when they seek to provide for convenient access thereto. The use of residual strips of land in order to prevent the extension of proposed or existing streets or access thereto is prohibited. 
    Street projections shall be designed and constructed as follows: 
(1)  Where there are lots fronting street projections to adjacent properties and services are required, a temporary turnaround shall be constructed at the end of the street at the property line, said turnaround to be constructed in accordance with the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual. 
(2)  Where there are no lots fronting street projections to adjacent properties and sight distance is adequate to forewarn a driver of a dead-end street, and where no services are required along the frontage, the frontage being more or less one (1) side lot length, the street may be constructed to the property line and dead-ended with no cul-de-sac required in accordance with of the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual. 
(3)  The subdivision review board shall reserve the right to require or not to require the partial or total initial construction of street projections to adjacent properties, or to require guarantee of construction of all or part of such street projections at a later time by provision of surety in the form of cash, letter of credit or other method acceptable to the city. 
(4)  In any and all cases, the developer shall be responsible for the cost of and placement of all required dead-end barricades and signs. 
(5)  Additional rights-of-way needed for a temporary turnaround at the end of the street projections to adjacent properties shall be in the form of temporary easements or rights-of-way granted to the city by proper instrument as approved by the city attorney. It is the intention that upon extension of the street into the adjacent property the requirement for a cul-de-sac will cease and that the temporary right-of-way granted for the cul-de-sac construction will revert to the adjacent property owner. 
(j)  [Vehicle turnarounds.] In phasing the construction of street improvements within approved subdivisions, the developer must make provision for vehicle turnarounds at the end of street construction for each phase. If the street end of a particular planned phase of development is within a distance of two hundred fifty (250) linear feet, more or less, from the next planned intersection in a succeeding phase, the developer will be required to construct the street to, and complete all improvements within, the intersection in accordance with requirements for completed intersections, including barricades, as specified in the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual. The completed intersection will then serve as a vehicular turnaround. 
(k)  Street connectivity requirements. The City of Wilmington hereby determines and recognizes that an interconnected street system is necessary in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, in order to ensure that streets will function in an interdependent manner, in order to provide adequate access for emergency and service vehicles, in order to enhance nonvehicular travel such as pedestrians and bicycles and in order to provide continuous and comprehensible traffic routes. For reference, see Institute for Transportation Engineers, ITE Transportation Planning Council Committee 5P-8, Traditional Neighborhood Development Street Design Guidelines (June 1997). 
    All proposed streets shall be continuous and connect to existing or platted streets without offset with the exception of cul-de-sacs as permitted and except as provided below. The street network for any subdivision shall achieve a connectivity ratio of not less than 1:40. The phrase "connectivity ratio" means the number of street links divided by the number of nodes or link ends, including cul-de-sac heads. A "link" means and refers to that portion of a street defined by a node at each end or at one (1) end. Approved stubs to adjacent property shall be considered links. Alleys shall not be considered links. 
    A "node" refers to the terminus of a street or the intersection of two (2) or more streets, except that intersections that use a roundabout shall not be counted as a node. For the purposes of this section, an intersection shall be defined as: any curve or bend of a street that fails to meet minimum curve radius in accordance with the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual, or any location where street names change as reviewed and approved by the technical review committee. 
    For purposes of this subsection, the street links and nodes within the collector or thoroughfare streets providing access to a proposed subdivision shall not be considered in computing the connectivity ratio. 
    Residential streets shall be designed so as to minimize the block length of local streets, to provide safe access to residences with minimal need for steep driveways and to maintain connectivity between and through residential neighborhoods for autos and pedestrians. 
    Where necessary to provide access or to permit the reasonable future subdivision of adjacent land, rights-of-way and improvements shall be extended to the boundary of the development. A temporary turnaround may be required where the dead end street exceeds five hundred (500) feet in length. The platting of partial width rights-of-way shall be prohibited except where the remainder of the necessary right-of-way has already been platted, dedicated or established by other means. 
    New subdivisions may be exempt from the connectivity ratio standard as set forth in this section, provided the appropriate reviewing agency determines there is no option for providing stub streets or connectivity due to existing documented environmental features such as wetlands or natural water bodies or existing adjacent developed property. 
(Ord. No. 0-2008-25, 4-8-08) 
Sec. 18-379. - Street names and signs; subdivision names. 
(a)  Street names shall not duplicate nor be phonetically similar to existing street names or development names throughout New Hanover County. New streets passing through subdivisions and minor intersections that are in alignment with other existing named streets shall bear the name of the existing street. Street names shall not contain special characters, including, but not limited to, hyphens, apostrophes, periods or abbreviations. The city manager, or designee, may deny any street name that is difficult to pronounce, has an unconventional spelling or may be considered profane or offensive. All street names shall be consistent with any additional rules and regulations set forth in the Address Standards and Procedures Manual for New Hanover County and the City of Wilmington. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to erect official street name signs at all intersections associated with the subdivision in accordance with the Technical Standards and Specifications Manual. The subdivider may acquire and erect official street name signs or may choose to contract with the city to install the street signs and the subdivider shall pay the cost of such installation. 
(b)  Subdivision names shall not duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing development or subdivision names within the city or county, except where existing developments are expanded. 
(Ord. No. O-2010-40, § 1, 6-1-10) 
Sec. 18-380. - Street lights. 
    The city shall install street lights within subdivisions in accordance with the standards of the city. In instances where underground wiring is specified, the subdivider shall reimburse the city for the initial contribution required under the utility company's street lighting service schedule (customer participation) at the time of installation. 
Sec. 18-381. - Traffic-control devices. 
    The subdivider shall install traffic signals, traffic signs, street name signs at all intersections associated with the subdivision, dead-end barricades and markings, and other required traffic control devices in accordance with the city's Technical Standards and Specifications Manual. 
(Ord. No. O-2012-85, Exh. A, § 19, 12-4-12) 
Sec. 18-382. - Water supply. 
    The subdivider within the city limits shall connect to the water system of the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority in order to provide water to every lot within the subdivision. Mains shall be constructed in accordance with Cape Fear Public Utility Authority standards and policies. Water connections shall be constructed under the supervision and approval of the city manager and the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority. 
(Ord. No. 0-2008-41, § 12, 6-3-08) 
Sec. 18-383. - Recreation space. 
(a)  General provisions. Every subdivider of land for residential purposes, shall dedicate a portion of such land, as set forth herein, for the purpose of providing active and passive recreation areas to serve the residents of the immediate neighborhood within the subdivision. 
(b)  Active and passive recreation space dedications. 
(1)  Recreation areas shall be defined for active or passive recreation use as follows: 
a.  Active recreation consists of areas such as park land chosen without regard to natural features for the explicit purposes of enhancing design, such as village commons, or providing space for outdoor recreation activities which may include, but are not limited to, tennis courts, ball fields, swimming pools, and tot lots with play equipment. No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the required active recreation may be located in an indoor facility such as, but not limited to, exercise rooms, clubhouses, and gymnasiums. Parking spaces associated with these uses, whether required or not, shall not be counted towards satisfying the required active recreation space provision. 
b.  Passive recreation areas shall consist of undisturbed, unique and sensitive natural features when available, that may include streams, floodplains, wetlands (excluding tidal marsh) conservation resources, and natural heritage areas, if identified. These natural spaces will be characterized by undisturbed soils and natural vegetative cover for wildlife habitat. Passive recreational space may become part of designated city and county greenways. Amenities such as walking paths, piers, picnic areas and other passive recreational uses will be allowed with minimal disturbance of the vegetation. 
(c)  Required recreation space. 
(1)  All new residential subdivisions shall provide recreation space in the amount of 0.03 acres per dwelling unit within the subdivision. No more than fifty (50) percent of the required recreation space can be designated as either active or passive recreation areas. Natural areas set aside as contiguous undisturbed open spaces can be used to satisfy passive recreation area requirements and can exceed fifty (50) percent of the total provided the basic requirements of active recreation are met. 
(2)  Recreation space areas shall be of such minimum dimensions as to be functionally usable and maintainable. Residential subdivisions that are small enough so that the amount of required recreation space area does not exceed twenty thousand (20,000) square feet shall be exempt from providing such space when the board determines that: 
a.  Recreation space area cannot be combined with such areas serving adjacent property to form a functionally usable and maintainable area; or 
b.  The recreational needs of the development can be adequately met by existing or planned city-owned park, recreation or open space areas located close enough to such development to reasonably serve its residents. In determining the size of a subdivision for the purposes of this subsection, the board shall consider the entire project developed on a single tract or contiguous multiple tracts under common ownership, regardless of whether the subdivision is constructed in phases or stages. The developer of any subdivision that is exempt from providing on-site recreation or open space shall pay a fee to the city in lieu thereof, to be used by the city to acquire recreation areas serving the development within the immediate area of the subdivision. Such fee shall be determined and paid as provided in the "Payments in Lieu of Dedication" provisions of this section; or 
c.  The subdivision review board may allow the development to provide a combination of some open space and pay a fee to the city in lieu thereof when conditions exist where providing the entire amount of required open space is not reasonable and the recreational needs of the development can be adequately met. The maximum amount of open space that can be considered for payment in lieu is twenty thousand (20,000) square feet. The developer of any subdivision permitted to develop under this option shall pay a fee in lieu thereof, to be used by the city to acquire recreation areas serving the development within the immediate area of the subdivision. Such fee shall be determined and paid as provided in the "Payments in Lieu of Dedication" provisions of this section. 
(d)  Standards for park, recreation and open space areas. Except as otherwise approved by the appropriate governing body, all park, recreation and open space areas shall meet the following criteria: 
(1)  Unity. The dedicated land shall form a single parcel of land, whether or not the subdivision is developed in phases or sections, except where it is determined by the board, that two (2) or more parcels would be in the best interests of the residents of the subdivision and the public; and in such case, the board, may require that such parcels be connected. 
(2)  Usability. At least one-half (1/2) of the total land dedicated must be outside of wetland areas under the jurisdiction of the federal and state regulatory agencies and usable for active recreation. Areas set aside to meet the requirements of the conservation resource regulations can only be credited for one-half (1/2) of the area required for passive recreation. Tidal marshes may not be counted to satisfy the recreational space requirements. 
(3)  Shape. The portion of dedicated land to be used for active recreation shall be of such a shape to be usable for active recreational facilities including, but not limited to, tennis courts, racquetball courts, swimming pools, exercise rooms, clubhouses, athletic fields, basketball courts, swings, slides and play apparatus. 
(4)  Greenways. If open space is a greenway, the land shall be a continuous linear parcel through the subdivision of at least thirty (30) feet in width. 
(5)  Location. The dedicated land shall be located so as to reasonably serve the recreation and open space needs of residents of the immediate neighborhood within the subdivision for which the land dedication is made and can be combined with an adjacent park. The location of dedicated land shall be in conformance with any adopted open space plans. 
(6)  Access. All dwelling units in the subdivision shall have free, easy and convenient ingress and egress to and from the park, recreation and open space areas provided within the development by means of improved streets or dedicated walkways. Rights-of-way for such access shall be shown on the preliminary plans and final plats. 
(7)  Topography. The average slope of the portion of dedicated land deemed usable for active recreation shall not exceed the average slope of the entire subdivision to be developed, and in no case shall the slope of the land dedicated be greater than fifteen (15) percent. 
(8)  Required stormwater detention/retention facilities. Required stormwater detention/retention facilities that are not designed, landscaped, and maintained as naturalized amenities integrated into preserved natural areas shall not be accepted to fulfill the requirements set forth by this section. Actual space devoted towards amenities, such as walking paths, piers, picnic areas, and other passive recreational space that are associated with stormwater management facilities (i.e., wet ponds) shall receive credit towards the calculation of open space if such amenities associated with stormwater management facilities are designed according to the standards specified in the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual to meet this requirement. 
(9)  Landscaping. Park and recreation areas shall be landscaped and shall contain sufficient natural or manmade screening or buffer areas to minimize any negative impacts upon adjacent residences. Natural open space areas shall be left undisturbed in their natural vegetated condition or revegetated with native plantings if previously disturbed or disturbed during development. 
(10)  Encroachments. The park, recreation and open space areas required by this section shall exclude roadways, parking areas and other accessory uses except recreational facilities. 
(11)  Consistency with master parks plan. If any portion of any subdivision proposed for residential development lies within an area designated on the officially adopted city or county master parks plan as a park, such area shall be included as part of the area set aside to satisfy the requirements of this section. This area shall be dedicated to public use. 
(12)  Recreational facilities. The board may require the installation of recreational facilities after considering the: 
a.  Character of the park, recreation and open space area; 
b.  Estimated age and the recreation needs of person likely to reside in the development; 
c.  Proximity, nature, and excess capacity of existing municipal recreational facilities; 
d.  Cost of the recreational facilities. 
(e)  Procedure for dedication of land. 
(1)  Designation of land to be dedicated. Subdividers shall designate on the preliminary subdivision plan, the area or areas to be dedicated pursuant to this section. 
(2)  Review of land to be dedicated. Upon receipt of the preliminary subdivision plan, the planning division shall submit a copy thereof to the city manager for review. The city manager shall submit any and all recommendations concerning the land to be dedicated to the subdivision review board at its next scheduled meeting. 
(3)  Ownership. The type of ownership of land dedicated for park, recreation or open space purposes shall be selected by the owner, developer, or subdivider, subject to the approval of the board; provided, however, any of such areas included in the master parks plan shall be dedicated to the city. The type of ownership may include, but is not necessarily limited to, the following: 
a.  The city, subject to the acceptance by the Wilmington City Council; 
b.  Other public jurisdictions or agencies, subject to their acceptance; 
c.  Property owner, condominium or cooperative associations or organizations; 
d.  Shared, undivided interest by all property owners in the subdivision. 
(f)  Payments in lieu of dedication. 
(1)  General provisions. When the board determines (upon the recommendation of the city manager) that the park, recreation and open space needs of a subdivision may also be adequately met by facilities constructed or to be constructed on city-owned property or property to be acquired by the city within a reasonable time that is located close enough to such subdivision to reasonably serve its residents, the board may authorize the subdivider to make a payment to the city in lieu of dedication of park, recreation, or open space. The board may also authorize a combination dedication and partial payment in lieu of dedication when such is determined to be in the best interest of the citizens of the area to be served. 
(2)  Procedure. The subdivider shall include with the application for preliminary plan approval, a letter requesting approval to make a payment in lieu of dedication. The letter shall include the proposed per acre value and the basis for the determination of such value. Upon receipt of the preliminary subdivision plan, a copy thereof with the letter requesting a payment in lieu of dedication shall be submitted to the city manager. The city manager shall submit any recommendations concerning the request to the board at its next scheduled meeting. 
(3)  Amount of payment. If the board approves a payment in lieu of dedication, the amount of such payment shall be the product of the number of acres to be dedicated as outlined in subsection (b) above, and the average fair market value of the land being subdivided at the time of the submission of the preliminary subdivision plan. The board shall determine the average fair market value of the land based on the value of the land for property tax purposes, the information submitted by the subdivider and other relevant information. 
(4)  Use of payments in lieu of dedication. All monies received by the city pursuant to this section shall be used only for the acquisition or development of recreation, park, or open space areas that will benefit the new subdivision residents. 
(5)  Required payment in lieu of dedication. In the event the board finds that a land dedication does not meet the long range plans of the city it shall require payment in lieu of a dedication. 
(6)  Time of payment. If a payment in lieu of dedication is authorized, such payment shall be made before recording the final plat for the subdivision. If a subdivision is developed in phases, a payment relating to each phase must be made prior to the recording of a final plat for each phase. 
(g)  Flexibility in administration authorized. 
(1)  The requirements set forth in this subsection concerning the amount, size, location and nature of park, recreation and open space areas to be provided in connection with residential developments are established by the city council as standards that preemptively will result in the provision of that amount of recreational facilities and open space that is consistent with officially adopted city or county plans. The city council recognizes, however, that due to the particular nature of a tract of land, or the nature of the facilities proposed for installation, or other factors, the underlying objectives of this section may be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with mathematical precision. Therefore, the board is authorized to permit minor deviations from these standards whenever it determines that: 
a.  The objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them; 
b.  Because of peculiarities in the developer's tract of land or the facilities proposed it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards. 
(2)  Whenever the board authorizes some deviation from the standards set forth in this section, the official record of action taken on the development application shall contain a statement of the reasons for allowing the deviation. 
(Ord. No. 0-2008-25, 4-8-08; Ord. No. O-2009-22, § 7, 3-24-09) 
Sec. 18-384. - Property owner associations. 
(a)  Final plans shall not be approved until the subdivision review board or chairman of the subdivision review board has determined that adequate provisions have been made through legal covenants and restrictions which shall govern a property owners' association, or through other legal agreements, that the responsibility for maintenance of streets, utilities, storm water management facilities, drainage ditches or swales, or other area designated as private areas. 
(b)  Required conditions of property owners' associations. Property owners' associations or similar legal entities that shall own and maintain park, recreation and open space areas, streets, utilities, storm water management facilities, drainage ditches or swales, or other areas designated as private areas or as common areas shall be established in such a manner that: 
(1)  Provision for the establishment of the association or similar entity shall be made before any lot in the development is sold or any building occupied. 
(2)  Membership must be mandatory for each property owner within the subdivision. 
(3)  The association shall be responsible for the liability insurance, property taxes and the maintenance of the areas. 
(4)  Any sums levied by the association that remain unpaid shall become a lien on the individual property owner's property. 
(5)  If all or any portion of the property, held by the association is being disposed of, or if the association is dissolved, the passive and active recreation and open space shall be first offered for dedication to the city. 
(6)  The right of use of the passive and active recreation or open space and all private improvements shall be guaranteed to each resident of the subdivision. 
The declaration of covenants and restrictions that will govern the association shall be submitted for review by the city attorney and recorded prior to the recording of any final plats for the subdivision and reference to the deed book and page provided on the plat. 
(c)  Property owners' associations shall be responsible for continuing upkeep and proper maintenance of all private infrastructure facilities and common areas within the respective subdivision. 
Sec. 18-385. - Reservation of public sites. 
    It is recommended that subdividers reserve sites for public facilities, such as schools and fire stations, and to provide the city an opportunity to buy such sites at the fair market value for a period of six (6) months from the date of approval of the preliminary plat. 
Sec. 18-386. - Transportation plans. 
    All preliminary and final plans for subdivisions should be in compliance with the Greater Wilmington Urban Area Thoroughfare Plan, Wilmington Urban Area Metropolitan Planning Organization Comprehensive Transportation Plan, Wilmington Urban Area Metropolitan Planning Organization Long Range Transportation Plan and all other roadway, traffic management, transit, pedestrian, bicycle, greenway and trail plans that have been adopted by the Wilmington City Council or the North Carolina Board of Transportation. Transportation facilities identified in these adopted plans shall be shown on all plats, preliminary and final.

Sec. 18-399. - Alternate design and construction methods, use and materials. 
    The design and construction standards, as specified herein and in the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual, shall be the minimum requirements. These minimum requirements are not intended to prevent alternate design, construction methods, or construction materials not specifically prescribed herein, provided any such alternate has been approved and its use authorized by the city engineer. The city engineer shall approve any such alternate, provided he finds the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with the minimum requirements as specified herein and that the material, method, or work offered is, for the purpose intended, at least the equivalent of the minimum requirements as specified herein. The city engineer shall require that sufficient evidence or proof is submitted to substantiate any claim that may be made regarding an alternate method, use or material. If, in the opinion of the city engineer, the evidence and proof are not sufficient to justify approval, the alternate shall be denied. 
Sec. 18-400. - Subdivider's responsibility. 
    While the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual has been compiled and published for the convenience of the public, the subdivider shall retain the responsibility to design and construct all improvements in conformance with the standards as they are approved by the city, whether at the level of minimum requirements or greater. 
Sec. 18-401. - Bikeways.

(b)  The subdivision review board may require the subdivider to make provisions for a bikeway, i.e., increased right-of-way, etc., to be installed at the city's expense. 
Sec. 18-402. - Blocks. 
(a)  Generally. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated; zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions; needs for vehicular and pedestrian circulation, control and safety of street traffic; limitations and opportunities of topography; and convenient access to public recreational areas. 
(b)  Block length. Blocks shall not exceed one thousand (1,000) feet in length and through/connecting streets shall be required. 
(c)  Block width. Blocks shall have sufficient width to allow two (2) tiers of lots of minimum depth, except where single tier lots are required to separate residential development from through vehicular traffic, to separate the lots from another type of use, to provide for uncongested traffic flow, to allow for unusual topographic conditions or in instances where said lots are adjacent to subdivision perimeter property lines. 
(d)  Pedestrian access. Where deemed necessary by the subdivision review board, a pedestrian access at least fifteen (15) feet in width may be required through a block or connecting streets or cul-de-sacs to provide convenient public access to a public or common area such as a park, open space area, school or a water area. 
Sec. 18-403. - Emergency services.

(b)  Intersections along a major thoroughfare shall be at least one thousand (1,000) feet apart, as measured from centerline to centerline or as determined by the subdivision review board. 
(c)  Where a street intersects a state-maintained highway, the design standards of the North Carolina Department of Transportation shall apply. 
Sec. 18-406. - Lots. 
(a)  Generally. Lot sizes, shapes and locations shall be made with due regard to topographic conditions, contemplated use and the surrounding area. 
(b)  Subdivisions subject to zoning district regulations. Lots shall conform to the area, dimensional and building setback requirements as prescribed in Article 5 of this chapter for the appropriate zoning district in which the proposed subdivision will be located. 
(c)  Lot access. Each lot of a subdivision shall individually abut or be adjacent to an approved street or private access easement as defined in Article 15 of this chapter. Townhouse-type and conservation tract subdivisions may be exempted from this requirement at the discretion of the subdivision review board; provided, however, in all cases, each individual lot shall be assured safe and reasonable vehicular access to and from an approved street. 
(d)  Double frontage. Double frontage or reverse frontage lots shall be avoided. Whenever the exception of such lots is permitted, the provisions of this chapter in subsection 18-369(d) and section 18-402 shall be provided by the subdivider. 
(e)  Corner lots. Corner lots are recommended to be increased one and one-half (1.5) times the minimum required lot size since corner lots normally have less building area due to the front setback line being applicable to two (2) or more sides. 
(f)  Side lot lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines. Where side lot lines intersect at the rear of the lot, the angle of intersection shall not be less than sixty (60) degrees. 
(g)  Maximum depth. Lots may not have a depth greater than four (4) times the mean width. 
(h)  Floodplain lots. Any portion of a subdivision subject to flooding and other hazards deemed by the subdivision review board to make the property uninhabitable shall be prohibited for occupancy or other uses that may jeopardize life, health or property. All subdivisions shall conform with the floodplain regulations of Article 13 of this chapter. Lots known to be within the 100-year FEMA floodplain or any area known to be subject to flooding shall be so identified on the preliminary plat and final subdivision plat.

Secs. 18-422-18-430. - Reserved. 
DIVISION V. - CLUSTER SUBDIVISION 

Sec. 18-431. - Purpose. 
    Cluster development is a form of subdivision development for single-family units that permits flexibility in dimensional requirements, such as reducing lot size and setbacks, in order to allow more flexible design than is permissible under the conventional subdivision process. Cluster development preserves natural open space and provides common open space for active and passive recreation use. Such subdivisions are allowed only in the R-20, R-15, R-10 and R-7 zoning districts. 
    The cluster development option shall not be permitted for properties located within the boundaries of designated National Register or Local Historic Districts or the 1945 corporate limits. 
Sec. 18-432. - Permitted uses. 
    The uses allowed in each district as described elsewhere are allowed in the cluster option of the R-20, R-15, R-10 and R-7 with the following modifications: 
Housing Type 
R-15: Single-family detached townhouses Single-family attached townhouses (maximum of four (4) units per structure) R-10: Single-family residential, duplex Single-family detached townhouses Single-family attached townhouses (maximum of four (4) units per structure) R-7: Single-family residential, duplex Single-family residential, triplex Single-family detached townhouses Single-family attached townhouses (maximum of four (4) units per structure) (1) The following shall be permitted only on parcels of that certain size described below: dwellings, attached (including townhouses) or multifamily buildings, of up to twelve (12) units per structure. For purposes of this section 18-432(1), the twelve-unit allowance per structure shall only be permitted if that parcel upon which the structure is constructed is at least three hundred (300) acres, and parcels of less than three hundred (300) acres cannot be combined after January 1, 2009, to satisfy the 300-acre requirement.  
Accessory apartments are only allowed with single-family detached homes. 
(Ord. No. 0-2008-25, 4-8-08; Ord. No. O-2009-4, § 1, 1-6-09) 
Sec. 18-433. - Development standards. 
(a)  Acreage minimum. The minimum site area for a cluster residential development shall be three (3) acres. 
(b)  Density. The net density of the development shall not exceed the following: 
R-20: 2.2 u/ac 
R-15: 3.0 u/ac 
R-10: 4.4 u/ac 
R-7: 6.2 u/ac 
Primary Conservation Areas, as defined below, which do not include CAMA designated areas of environmental concern (AECs) or areas of the floodplain, wetlands, streams, or natural ponds in which development is prohibited, may be included for calculation of net density. 
    Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) resource protection areas: Residential units shall not be clustered at a density greater than two and one half (2.5) units per net tract acre in areas classified Conservation, or Resource Protection in the Wilmington-New Hanover CAMA plan, except if the standards for exceptional development, as listed in Article 10 of this chapter, are followed. When calculating the net density for a site that includes portions that are in Resource Protection or Conservation Areas and portions that are outside those designated areas, the net density for the entire site is calculated by determining the number of allowed units for each portion separately and then summing the number of units permitted for each portion to determine the total number of allowed units for the entire site. For any portion of the site within the Conservation and Resource Protection Areas, the maximum density of two and one-half (2.5) units per acre shall be used and for the portion of the site outside the Conservation and Resource Protection Areas, the maximum density for the underlying zoning district shall be used. This formula is used even when all or most of the development occurs on the areas outside the Conservation and Resource Protection Areas due to the cluster design. To the extent that the development uses the standards for exceptionally designed projects as listed in Article 10 of this chapter, allowable density in Resource Protection Areas may be allowed to increase up to the maximum allowed in the underlying zoning district as described in subsection (b) above. 
(c)  Dimensional requirements. The following alternative dimensional requirements may be followed instead of the standards outlined in each district of Article 5 of this chapter. 
(1)  No minimum lot size. 
(2)  No minimum lot width. 
(3)  No structures within ten (10) feet of right-of-way. With respect to developments zoned R-7 and utilizing the cluster subdivision regulations, no structures shall be permitted within five (5) feet of the right-of-way excluding fences, site walls, and steps (to dwelling units) not exceeding six (6) feet in width. In instances where a ten-foot nonmunicipal easement is required, the structure setback from rights-of-way in all districts shall be no less than ten (10) feet. 
(4)  Minimum roadway frontage per parcel, thirty (30) feet. 
(5)  Minimum ten (10) feet between structures, or as required by the building code, whichever is greater. 
(6)  Perimeter buffer of twenty-five (25) feet shall be maintained in a natural state except for hand clearing of underbrush. This buffer shall not count towards the open space requirements. Essential site improvements as governed in this article, may encroach in this area. In the R-7 District, the 25-foot perimeter buffer may be waived when the adjoining zoning district is part of (1) the subject development and (2) contains compatible uses as determined by the technical review committee. 
(7)  Zero lot-line subdivisions are permitted under this option. 
(8)  With respect to developments zoned R-7 and utilizing the cluster subdivision regulations, all attached dwellings or multifamily buildings exceeding four (4) units per structure shall not be located within four hundred (400) feet from existing residential uses or platted residential lots. 
(9)  With respect to developments zoned R-7 and utilizing the cluster subdivision regulations, maximum height may be increased for attached or multifamily buildings, up to forty-five (45) feet, if the side and rear yard setbacks are increased an additional five (5) feet. 
(d)  Primary Conservation Areas. Each cluster development shall protect Primary Conservation Areas. Developments shall not disturb these areas. Primary Conservation Areas include: 
(1)  All wetlands, natural lakes, ponds, rivers, creeks or marshes. 
(2)  All areas of Class IV soils as defined in "A Classification of Soils in New Hanover County for Septic Tank Suitability," which includes soil types designated in the "Soil Survey of New Hanover County" as Johnston (Jo), Dorovan (Do), Pamlico Muck (Pm), and Tidal muck (Tm). 
(3)  Areas within the 100-year floodplain and floodways. 
(4)  Protected species habitat. 
(5)  A thirty-five-foot buffer around all natural ponds and wetlands and on both sides of streams measured from the top of the bank. When the required buffer is located on a stream or pond or wetland greater than five (5) acres, the buffer requirement may be met by providing an average buffer of thirty-five (35) feet, provided the following criteria are met: 
a.  Calculations are provided that show that the net buffer area provided is overall greater than would be achieved by a consistent thirty-five-foot buffer. 
b.  Wetland buffer areas may not be reduced to less than thirty-five (35) feet where the wetland narrows to a width of less than seventy-five (75) feet. 
c.  Buffer width of thirty-five (35) feet shall be maintained along each side of streams. 
d.  In no case may the buffer width be reduced to less than twenty (20) feet. 
e.  The buffer width may not be reduced along more than fifteen (15) percent of the perimeter of the wetlands. 
(6)  Forested areas and significant tree clusters as defined in this chapter. 
(e)  [Allowed disturbances.] The following disturbances may be allowed in Primary Conservation Areas: 
(1)  Improvements that would either protect or enhance the enjoyment of the conservation area. Such measures not causing significant impact include, but are not limited to, walkways, self-guided trails, and protective fences. 
(2)  Access to other parts of the parcel. If a part of the parcel may be developed but would be inaccessible due to the existence of a conservation area, a road and/or utilities may be constructed through the conservation area. The road and/or utilities shall be designed to minimize the impact to the conservation area to the greatest extent practical. 
(3)  Access to the waterfront. If the entire waterfront along a parcel is inaccessible due to the existence of required conservation area, a boat ramp or pier may be built for boating facilities in the conservation area, subject to relevant state and federal permits. The facilities shall be designed to minimize impact to the conservation area to the greatest extent practical. 
(f)  If less than forty (40) percent of the total area is designated as Primary Conservation Area, then developments are subject to additional open space requirements as defined in this section to reach a total of forty (40) percent open space. 
(g)  Open space. 
(1)  A minimum of forty (40) percent of the total land area shall be reserved as common or public open space including, at minimum, all of the area delineated as Primary Conservation Areas. 
(2)  No more than twenty-five (25) percent of that land reserved for common open space shall be improved for passive or active recreation. Such improved common open space must be located so that access is convenient to all residents of the cluster development. Improvements shall not be made that impact the resource intended to be protected in Primary Conservation Areas. 
(3)  Stormwater facilities that are not designed and maintained as amenities integrated into the improved common open space shall not count towards open space requirements. 
(4)  Open space shall not be isolated in one (1) portion of a parcel. Open space shall be contiguous, with a minimum width of fifty (50) feet, and be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots. For developments over ten (10) acres, open space may be designated as separate, noncontiguous parcels, but no such parcel shall be less than one (1) acre nor have a length-to-width ratio greater than four to one (4:1) except for buffers or primary conservation areas. A green trails system shall connect all such noncontiguous open space. Primary Conservation Areas are not subject to this requirement as their location is predetermined through existing conditions.

The inventory and identification shall be performed by a qualified professional and the location of existing vegetation shall be performed and certified by a professional land surveyor, and submitted as part of the site plan application. The inventory must include the size and species of each protected tree. The inventory must clearly indicate trees that are to be retained, and those for which removal is proposed. Areas that are designed as tree protection areas and that will not be disturbed can be delineated as such and do not require inventorying individual trees. 
(Ord. No. O-2008-25, 4-8-08; Ord. No. O-2010-91, § 29, 12-7-10) 
Sec. 18-456. - Protected trees. 
    The following categories of existing vegetation shall be considered protected and shall be retained as indicated: 
(a)  Regulated trees. Hardwood trees at least eight (8) inches DBH, all conifer trees at least twelve (12) inches DBH, and all dogwoods, magnolias, other ornamental flowering trees, and American hollies at least four (4) inches DBH anywhere on the site shall be considered regulated and protected, and shall be preserved according to this chapter and incorporated into required landscaping. If these trees are removed, regardless of location on the site, they shall be mitigated with replacement trees in accordance with section 18-460, or by use of credits in accordance with section 18-448, unless the trees are shown to be dead, dying or greater than fifty (50) percent damaged or diseased as a result of natural factors, or are otherwise exempted from mitigation. The total number of replacement trees shall be determined pursuant to section 18-460. 
(b)  Significant trees.

(Ord. No. 0-2008-25, 4-8-08; Ord. No. O-2012-85, Exh. A, § 26, 12-4-12) 
Sec. 18-457. - Retention standards for protected trees. 
    Protected trees may be removed only if essential site improvements, as defined in Article 15 of this chapter, cannot be accommodated elsewhere on the site. If any protected trees are to be cleared from the site for essential site improvements, the proposed removal must be indicated, the reasons for doing so shall be clearly stated on the tree survey, and a tree removal permit must be obtained pursuant to Division III of this article. Such factors as nonselective clearing by bulldozer is less expensive than selective clearing by chainsaw or removal to accommodate nonessential site improvements shall not be valid reasons for removal of protected trees. Clearing of sites shall be limited to areas approved for construction. 
(a)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and retain existing trees and shrubs not actually lying in planned roadways, drainage ways, building foundation footprints, and construction activity areas. Applicants shall contact the reviewing agency and the reviewing agency will determine whether a meeting is required prior to site plan development to evaluate the site and tree retention opportunities. Roadways and building sites should be planned to minimize the removal of protected trees. 
(b)  No land disturbance, including removal of any trees, is permitted on areas outside of necessary grading limit for essential site improvements other than necessary to tie back into the existing contours, or to meet landscaping requirements. 
(c)  Significant trees must be preserved inside the limits of disturbance where possible. Trees requiring removal will be mitigated pursuant to section 18-460. 
(d)  Land clearing and construction contractors shall receive adequate instruction on tree protection requirements and methods. 
(e)  The following may be required or permitted by the reviewing agency to accommodate protected trees: 
(1)  Site sensitivity in location and designing parking, stormwater facilities, utilities, streets, and buildings in relation to existing topographic features and vegetative cover. Adjustments to the location or positioning of essential site improvements that do not compromise the intended use may be required. 
(2)  Reduction of parking to the minimum required per the zoning ordinance for the appropriate use. 
(3)  Reduction in required street yards, landscape islands, foundation plantings, or setbacks for the purpose of retaining trees. 
(f)  Wooded sites shall be developed with careful consideration of the natural characteristics of the site. Forested areas and vegetated areas unsuitable for development shall be preserved to the greatest extent practical and set aside as conservation areas, stormwater treatment areas, or open space. 
(g)  A minimum of fifteen (15) trees at least two (2) inches DBH shall be retained or planted on the parcel for each acre or proportionate area disturbed by development.

Sec. 18-458. - Tree protection during construction. 
(a)  To preserve existing trees specified on the required landscape plan to remain on the site as a function of fulfilling purposes of this section, the critical root zone shall be protected by proper installation of barricades and signage from vehicular movement, material storage, compacting, grading, excavating, and other development related activities during construction and in the final landscape design. 
(b)  The critical root zone (CRZ) shall be protected during construction by approved tree protection fencing and practices. Tree protective fencing shall be shown on site plans and grading plans around each tree, cluster of trees, at perimeter of tree-save areas, and at limits of disturbance. No equipment is allowed on the site until all tree protection fencing and silt fencing has been installed and approved. Tree protective fencing shall remain in place through completion of construction activities. 
(c)  If the entire CRZ cannot be preserved, the disturbed area shall extend no closer to the protected tree trunk than one half (1/2) the radius of the CRZ. In no case can more than forty (40) percent of the CRZ be disturbed. 
(d)  Disturbance of the CRZ will only be allowed on one (1) side of the retained tree and only with prior approval by the appropriate reviewing agency. 
(e)  Prior to grading, tree roots shall be pruned using appropriate arboriculture pruning tools and practices. 
(f)  Disturbance other than that allowed on the approved plan, including incorrectly placed tree protection fencing or improper root pruning constitutes negligence and will require the owner to post an irrevocable letter of credit or other means of financial assurance approved by the reviewing agency for three (3) years to provide for mitigation of the tree per section 18-460 to be released if determined by the reviewing agency that the tree is not at risk of dying due to the disturbance. 
(g)  Any person who is responsible for failing to properly install or maintain protection measures pursuant to this article shall be subject to a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day and a stop work order shall be placed on the project. The owner of the property shall also be a jointly and severally responsible party if the improper practices are conducted by an employee, agent, or other person under the control, employ, or direction of the property owner.

Sec. 18-459. - Negligence. 
    If a tree required to be protected is destroyed, substantially damaged, or dies as a result of negligence or failure to comply with the requirements of this section on the part of any property owner and/or agent of the owner, within three (3) years after completion of construction, then replacement trees of a similar species shall be planted on the site pursuant to section 18-460. 
Sec. 18-460. - Mitigation. 
(a)  Protected trees. Protected trees shall be mitigated on the site using trees of equal or higher value in Table IV and of the size specified in section 18-448. 
(b)  Significant trees. The total number of replacement trees shall be determined by multiplying the total DBH of the removed significant trees by two (2) times the percentage for the type of tree in Table IV and dividing by three (3). 
(c)  Regulated trees. The total number of replacement trees shall be determined for regulated trees removed by multiplying the total DBH of the removed regulated tree(s) by the percentage for the type of tree in Table IV and dividing by three (3). 
(d)  A minimum growing area of one hundred forty-four (144) square feet of pervious surface shall be provided for each replacement tree. 
(e)  Pines may be mitigated on site with long-leaf pine plugs spaced ten (10) feet apart at a rate of one (1) plug per inch DBH of the removed tree multiplied by the percentage in Table IV divided by three (3). Alternatively, up to one-half (1/2) of the pine plugs required for replacement may be substituted with replacement hardwoods of equal or higher value in Table IV at the rate of one (1) hardwood per pine plug required. 
(f)  If in the determination of the city manager, the site cannot accommodate the required numbers of trees or pine plugs, then only the amount of trees or pine plugs which can be accommodated on the site will be replaced and the remainder of caliper inches shall be mitigated through a payment in lieu of providing on-site trees. This payment shall be made into the City Tree Improvement Fund to be used for plantings of public spaces in the general vicinity of the project. The amount of the payment shall be in accordance with the pricing standards of the respective jurisdiction. 
(g)  Mitigation payment in lieu will not be required if in the judgment of the reviewing agency trees are retained on the site to the maximum extent practical, and the following conditions are met: 
(1)  The site has a definable street yard with canopy that exceeds the standard width made up at least in part by retained tree clusters; 
(2)  The site exceeds the buffer requirements, at least in part by retained trees, tree clusters, and vegetation; 
(3)  The site exceeds the interior parking area landscaping minimum percent coverage requirements, at least in part by retained trees and tree clusters; and 
(4)  A minimum DBH of one hundred seventy-five (175) inches per acre of trees of two (2) inches DBH or greater is retained on the site in natural clusters. 
(h)  Any mitigation trees required as a result of the removal of protected tree(s) shall not be counted to meet the requirements of the street yard, buffers or interior parking requirements. These trees must be provided in addition to any tree required by this ordinance.

(4)  No more than fifteen (15) percent of the required street yard shall be covered with an impervious surface. This portion of the street yard may be used for walkways, fountains, walls or fences but no parking areas shall be permitted in these designated areas. 
(c)  If there are existing trees in the proposed street yard area, the city manager may grant credit toward meeting tree preservation requirements, provided their caliper is at least two (2) inches or more. In addition, the city manager may require the saving of any protected tree in the street yard area. 
(d)  The street yard is calculated by multiplying the designated street yard factor in accordance with the zoning designation of the property by the linear street frontage of the subject property minus the width of all approved driveways. The resultant square footage is required to be installed as the minimum street yard amount. The applicant may install the street yard in any configuration that provides the required amount of street yard square footage between the property line and any site improvements. The maximum and minimum widths as listed in Table II may not be exceeded in any portion of the street yard.

(e)  The applicant may choose to increase the street yard multiplier up to twenty-five (25) percent above the stated multiplier in Table II, and receive an equivalent reduction in the building's front yard setback. 
(f)  For all lots of record prior to the adoption of these requirements of two (2) acres or less, if the city manager determines that the essential site improvements cannot be accommodated under the current requirements, then the required street yard square footage may be reduced up to one-half (1/2), but in no case shall be less than one-half (1/2). 
(g)  Street yards shall be required along all street frontages. For sites with two (2) or more street frontages, only the primary street frontage must contain the full amount of street yard as indicated in Table II; all secondary street frontages shall contain one-half (1/2) the required square footage amount as indicated in Table II. 
(h)  [Buffer strips may] be required along all street frontages. When reviewing the development plan, the city manager, may require buffer strips, as regulated in Division VII of this article, along the street frontage to protect adjoining land uses, particularly residential, from the impacts of more intense developments

DIVISION V. - PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING 

Sec. 18-481. - Interior area landscaping. 
    The interior area of a parking facility shall be shaded by canopy trees either planted or retained to provide twenty (20) percent or greater canopy coverage at maturity. For purposes of this section, a parking facility shall include any areas of a development devoted to pedestrian or vehicular use, including, but not limited to, parking areas, loading spaces, automobile sales lots, driveways and internal drive aisles. The following standards shall apply to interior parking area landscaping: 
(a)  All single planting islands measuring twelve (12) feet by eighteen (18) feet or having the equivalent square footage shall have at least one (1) tree. All double planting islands measuring twelve (12) feet by thirty-six (36) feet or having the equivalent square footage shall have at least two (2) small mature shade trees or one canopy tree. All larger planting islands will have additional trees in increments of one (1) tree for each additional two hundred (200) square feet if installing small shade trees or one (1) tree for every four hundred (400) square feet if installing canopy trees. All planting islands shall have additional ground cover or shrubbery from the approved plantings list to cover the entire landscaped island, subject to the walkway allowance as indicated below. At least seventy-five (75) percent of the trees required hereunder shall be of a large shade/canopy species as defined in the approved plantings list that have or will have at maturity a DBH of at least twelve (12) inches. Small maturing shade trees may be planted where overhead power lines would interfere with normal growth or for site design considerations, if trees are maintained in their natural form. 
(b)  Interior landscaping within automobile sales lots may be distributed so that smaller shade trees are utilized toward the interior of the lot, and larger shade trees are placed toward the perimeter, provided the twenty (20) percent canopy cover of the parking facility is achieved. In no case shall any merchandise from these uses be displayed within a required landscape area. 
(c)  Up to fifteen (15) percent of a landscaped island may be devoted to pedestrian walkways, as needed. 
(d)  The planting size for interior trees shall be as specified in section 18-448. 
(e)  All plantings shall be evenly distributed throughout the parking facility unless reconfiguration has been allowed pursuant to this article to retain existing vegetation and provided the twenty (20) percent canopy cover is achieved. 
(f)  All interior plantings shall be curbed or otherwise physically protected such as by wheel stops. If curbing is used, however, curb openings shall be installed to allow passage of stormwater into landscaped areas designed with depressed contours for infiltration. 
(g)  Consecutive parking spaces shall incorporate landscaped islands at the ends of all parking rows and within the rows, such that no parking space is located more than one hundred twenty (120) feet from a planting island or peninsula unless reconfiguration has been allowed pursuant to this Article to retain existing vegetation and provided the twenty (20) percent canopy cover is achieved. Islands shall contain at least two hundred sixteen (216) square feet in area and be at least twelve (12) feet in width, measured from back of curb barrier to back of curb barrier. Depressions in interior and perimeter landscaping in combination with curb openings, grading to deliver runoff from parking lot to landscaped areas, and overflow control shall be used where feasible and where soils permit for creating bio-retention and infiltration areas for water quality protection and groundwater recharge. 
(h)  Interior landscaping requirements may be waived to allow reconfiguring of designs to retain existing trees in or adjacent to parking areas. Barriers are still required at the ends of parking lanes where necessary to aid safe flow of traffic. 
(i)  Parking facilities landscaping for the O&I and NB Districts shall include the following additional shading requirements reflecting the amount of impervious surface which is proposed: 
Impervious Surface 
(square feet) Required Interior Shading 
(percent) 0-10,000 20 10,000-25,000 25 25,000-50,000 30 50,000-100,000 35 100,000+ 40  
(j)  For purposes of determining if the landscape plan meets the shading requirements of this section, each canopy tree of the type described in this section shall be presumed to shade a circular area of seven hundred and seven (707) square feet (based on having a canopy radius of fifteen (15) feet with the trunk of the tree as the center). When smaller shade trees are planted, each tree shall be presumed to shade a circular area of three hundred and fourteen (314) square feet (based on having a canopy radius of ten (10) feet). Perimeter trees shall be given credit for that portion of the area of the canopy that overlays the parking area. Using this standard, twenty (20) percent of the parking facility area must have canopy coverage. For existing trees, credit shall be given for the actual canopy overhanging the parking facility. The trees counted toward meeting the shading requirement shall be indicated and calculations shall be shown on the landscape plan.

Sec. 18-482. - Perimeter landscaping. 
(a)  A landscaped yard ten (10) feet in width shall be required along any side of a parking lot abutting a separate parking lot, driveway, or residentially-zoned property. Plantings shall consist, at a minimum of one (1) tree of the size specified in section 18-448 every eighteen (18) to twenty seven (27) feet. If a buffer yard or street yard is required in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance then the ten (10) foot width may be included as part of the buffer yard or street yard. The landscaped yard may be interrupted by driveway connections between parking lots. If adjacent parking lots are developed concurrently then both properties can install a minimum of five-foot yard or any multiple agreed upon in writing by the two (2) property owners that would equal ten (10) feet of planted area between the parking lots. Adjacent lots that choose to share a double parking row split down the middle of a drive isle are exempt from this requirement. Perimeter landscaping areas shall be designed with depressed contours and curb openings to receive surface flow directed from parking lot runoff where feasible for creating bioretention and infiltration areas for water quality protection and groundwater recharge. 
(b)  For redevelopment of nonconforming parking facilities containing five (5) to twenty-five (25) parking stalls inclusive, a perimeter landscape yard may be provided in lieu of interior landscaping, subject to the following requirements: 
(1)  The minimum width of such yard shall be ten (10) feet. 
(2)  For every forty (40) linear feet or fraction thereof, the perimeter landscape yard shall contain one (1) canopy tree or three (3) understory trees of the size specified in section 18-448 and a continuous row of evergreen shrubs at least eighteen (18) inches in height. 
(3)  Where a perimeter landscape yard overlaps a streetyard or buffer yard required elsewhere in this chapter, the more stringent or higher standard shall control over the less stringent or lower standard.

Sec. 18-483. - Parking area screening. 
    When a parking facility is within fifty (50) feet of a right-of-way, if the buffer yard provisions of this ordinance do not call for a planted buffer, a low buffer shall be incorporated into the street yard to provide protection from vehicle headlights within the parking lot. The buffer shall consist of shrubbery, a grade change or planted berm or any combination thereof that serves to shield traffic on the right-of-way from headlights within the parking lot. The buffer shall be a minimum of three (3) feet in height and five (5) feet in width and may be incorporated in a street yard, provided the street yard is fifteen (15) feet or more in width. Depressions and curb cuts shall be allowed for water quality protection. 
Sec. 18-484. - Waivers. 
(a)  The city manager may waive all or part of the requirements of this division for any facility which is limited to periodic or intermittent use for vehicular parking lots for churches or recreational facilities, provided the facility is completely covered by grass or otherwise presents a landscaped effect.

DIVISION VII. - BUFFER YARDS 

Sec. 18-496. - Purpose. 
    Buffer yards are designed to protect adjoining land uses, particularly residential, from the noise, heat, dust, lights, threats to privacy, and aesthetic impacts from more intense land uses. Buffer yards shall be required along all property lines adjacent to a residential use or district, except where a reduced building setback precludes placement of a buffer yard in situations where the adjoining property contains a nonresidential use of residentially zoned property, such as a church or school. The more intense land use shall be required to provide the buffer as part of its yard requirements. The following requirements shall be met for buffer yards and the yards in which buffers are required. 
Sec. 18-497. - Location of buffer yards. 
    Buffer yards shall be required to screen any residential use from any nonresidential uses or districts. Buffer yards shall also be required to screen any residential use or district from any attached housing development or mobile home park or high-density development or Planned Development. However, no buffer yard will be required for high density detached lots provided lots equal or exceed five thousand (5,000) square feet. 
(a)  The exact location and arrangement of materials and plantings in the buffer yards will be determined based upon an analysis of site topography and sight lines from public spaces or private properties which are to be protected. 
(b)  Where practical, buffer strips will be designed to facilitate stormwater management objectives, including bio-retention, constructed wetlands, and infiltration except where it would result in damage or removal of existing vegetation otherwise required to be preserved. 
Sec. 18-498. - Width of buffer yards. 
    Buffer yards shall have a base width equal to at least fifty (50) percent of the required setback. In all cases the base of the buffer yard shall be equal to or greater than twenty (20) feet, except as allowed in this article. Where a utility easement occupies a portion of the buffer yard, sufficient buffer width must be provided outside the utility easement to meet the required opacity standards. 
Sec. 18-499. - Site constraints. 
    In the event that preexisting conditions on an infill, redevelopment or expansion project within the city limits result in site constraints (i.e. small lot, drainage swale, etc) that prevent meeting the standard options for buffer yards as required in this section, the city manager may alter the buffer yard requirements to no less than ten (10) feet with a solid eight (8) to ten (10) foot fence provided the spirit and intent of this section is met. Such an allowance will only be made at the request of the applicant, who shall submit a plan showing how the proposed buffer would screen the intended use. The allowance will not be granted without documenting to the satisfaction of the city manager that constraints on the site prohibit otherwise meeting the requirements of this section. 
Sec. 18-500. - Allowance for a decreased setback width and increase in buffer width. 
    The setback for structures may be decreased if the base width of the buffer yard as determined by this article is increased by the same amount. 
Sec. 18-501. - Uses in the buffer. 
    No activities shall occur in the buffer except for maintenance of the buffer and the installation and maintenance of water, sewer, electrical and other utility systems where the installation causes minimal disturbance of existing vegetation. No buffer yard required by this section may contain any building or structure, or extension of any building or structure mechanical system. This prohibition shall apply at the time of issuance of a certificate of occupancy and at any time thereafter, and shall include, but not be limited to, porches, decks, patios, HVAC system components, waste containers, storage buildings or any other fixture or structure, whether temporary or permanent. 
Sec. 18-502. - Uses in the rear and side yards abutting a residential use. 
    The following uses shall be shielded from view from the property line of the residential use or district by means of a one hundred (100) percent opaque solid wall: 
(a)  Dumpsters or other trash holding areas. 
(b)  Outside storage areas. 
(c)  Loading/unloading areas. 
(d)  Heating/air-conditioning units including roof-mounted units. 
Sec. 18-503. - Types of buffer yards. 
    Buffer yards shall provide approximately one hundred (100) percent opacity with plantings as specified in the approved plantings list. Buffer yards may be occupied only by natural and/or planted vegetation, berms, and fencing as specified below. For all types, however, the planted material shall be a combination of trees and shrubs. 
(a)  Natural vegetation must be retained in accordance with Division II of this article. 
(b)  One (1) or more of the following means shall be used to supplement the natural vegetation as necessary or to provide an adequate buffer where no natural vegetation exists: 
(1)  Planted buffer yards-The planted buffer yards shall perform as "opaque screens" achieving one hundred (100) percent opacity from the ground to a height of six (6) feet, with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least twenty (20) feet, within three (3) years of planting. Trees shall be of the size specified in section 18-448 at planting, and should be selected from the screening tree list. Shrubs shall be a minimum of three (3) feet high at planting. To provide a variety of height and depth, at least one (1) tree on average will be planted for every thirty (30) linear feet of screen. Spacing of trees should be varied from straight lines and equidistant spacing where practical. Clustering and/or random spacing of plants and trees is encouraged to produce a natural appearance in the landscape to the extent that the planting meets the screening and opacity intent of this section. Trees should be placed and spaced to provide visual aesthetic appeal; to accommodate specific growth habits of species used; to incorporate existing trees into the screen; and clustered where appropriate to provide the maximum visual buffering protection to the adjacent use. 
(2)  Compliance of planted vegetation screens or natural vegetation will be determined on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstruction should not leave any completely unobstructed openings of more than ten (10) feet wide where it is providing screening of structures. The portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants. 
(c)  Combination planted buffer yard with artificial fencing: 
(1)  Artificial fencing shall be between six (6) and ten (10) feet in height 
(2)  If solid artificial fencing is used two (2) rows of planted materials consisting of a combination of trees and shrubs shall be provided at a minimum height of three (3) feet at initial planting and give at least fifty (50) percent visual opacity of the fence at planting; 
(3)  If permeable artificial fencing is used, two (2) rows of planted materials shall be provided which give approximately one hundred (100) percent visual opacity of the fence within three (3) years of planting. 
(4)  The buffer vegetation shall be located between the fence and the common property line. 
(d)  Combination berm with vegetation: 
(1)  An earthen berm may be used in conjunction with planted vegetation provided that the combined height of the berm and planted vegetation shall be at least six (6) feet and provide approximately one hundred (100) percent opacity within three (3) years of planting. 
(2)  The slope of the berm shall be stabilized with vegetation and no steeper than 3:1. The height of the berm shall be six (6) feet or less with a level or rounded area on top of the berm. The berm shall be constructed of compacted earth. 
(3)  The berm shall be designed to prevent standing water or to impede the flow of stormwater from adjacent properties. 
(4)  Any berm shall be substantially planted and covered with live vegetation. No berm shall be vegetated entirely with Turf grass or ground cover. 
(5)  For berms greater than two (2) feet in height, all trees shall be planted within two (2) vertical feet of natural grade and shall be species that have no-to-low irrigation requirements, unless on-site surface water is used for irrigation. 
(6)  Berms are not permitted where installation will destroy or damage trees that are required to be retained under this section, or existing trees and other vegetation that functionally meet or partially meet the buffer requirements of this section. 
Sec. 18-504. - Screening for dumpsters and outside storage areas. 
    For any of the following uses located within the view of any adjacent property or right-of-way, a visual screen shall be required to shield the use from the view of any adjacent property or right-of-way. Screening shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in height along the front or corner side of any lot and eight (8) feet in height along any side or rear property line. Chain link fencing shall not be permitted as a screening alternative. The screening shall consist of living and nonliving material as specified in this article. No screening shall be required along any side and/or rear property line that is adjacent to any manufacturing or industrial use, or when adjacent to any business which operates a towing service or whose principal use is "automotive repair". 
(a)  The rear side of a building where that side abuts a street right-of-way, or any dumpster or trash receptacle storage area, or service entrances and loading docks used in connection with any business establishment. 
(b)  Any outside storage area for vehicles awaiting repair in connection with any automotive or towing business. 
(c)  Any outside storage area for any equipment used in excavation, building site preparation, or construction. No part of any equipment stored in such area may project above the screen. 
(d)  Any ground level mechanical equipment such as HVAC, Electrical panels and similar mechanical equipment. 
Sec. 18-505. - Exceptions to buffer yard requirements. 
    For developments located in the CBD, Central Business District or for lots of record in the HD-MU, MS-MU, and the 1945 corporate limits of the City of Wilmington: When in the determination of the city manager or designee, conditions exist peculiar to the site that prevent the full width of the buffer from being installed, the buffer width requirements may be reduced up to and including full exemption. Applicable conditions would include but not be limited to: essential site improvements; providing for safe ingress, egress, and circulation for the site and when structures exist within the required buffer yard. In these events, the buffer yard shall only be reduced to that width which is necessary to accommodate such needs.

Secs. 18-521-18-525. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE 9. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING; DRIVEWAYS 

Sec. 18-526. - Off-street parking standards. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide off-street parking standards that will alleviate congestion in the streets and allow for the efficient storage of motor vehicles while, concurrently, reducing any adverse environmental impacts to the urban area. By reducing glare, noise levels and air pollution to occupants and residents of adjoining properties, and by controlling storm water drainage and soil erosion, these standards will generally contribute to the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizenry and will create a more aesthetically pleasing living environment in the City of Wilmington. 
(b)  [Parking must be provided.] Parking must be provided for new construction of principal buildings and certain instances of alterations to existing sites and conversions of buildings from one (1) district use or occupancy to another district or district use. No lands or buildings, or any part thereof, shall be occupied or used for any purpose, nor shall any building permit be approved, until the owner of the real estate involved provides off-street motor vehicle parking and driveways in accordance with the minimum requirements set forth herein and in the sections for off-street truck loading (section 18-527), off-street parking spaces (sections 18-528 and 18-532), off-street parking design (section 18-529), and driveways (section 18-530). No additional parking shall be required for the issuance of a building permit under subsection 18-142(h) of this chapter (reconstruction of nonconforming uses). When an existing building or use on the same lot is altered or expanded to increase its gross floor area by fifty (50) percent or more, or whenever a conversion of buildings from any district use to another district use requires additional off-street parking, all parking lot design requirements of this article shall be met. Other off-street parking facilities for which a plan is required under section 18-529 shall meet only those standards which the city manager determines to be necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare; except that this waiver shall not apply to expansions that occur within two (2) years of each other as noted by the dates the building permits were issued and that together would otherwise require all off-street parking improvements to be made. (See Article 8 for application of the landscaping requirements to building or use expansions.) 
(c)  Vehicle movement. All off-street parking areas, except those serving a single-family or two-family housing unit, shall be arranged so that ingress and egress is by the forward motion of the vehicle. 
(d)  Location on other property. If the required automobile parking space cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot as the principal use, it may be provided on a lot within two (2) city blocks or six hundred fifty (650) feet (whichever is greater) of the principal use structure. This parking area shall be held in fee simple by the owner of the use served, or in another manner that assures continued availability for required parking, provided the form of tenure shall be approved by the city attorney before such use is issued a certificate of occupancy. 
(e)  Nonresidential off-street parking in residential district. Such parking may be provided in residential districts upon issuance of a special use permit as required in Article 3, Division IV, subject to its prerequisites required in Article 6, Division I. 
(f)  Parking space in private driveways. Private driveways serving detached single-family and two-family housing units of sufficient size to meet the requirements of this section shall be considered as providing the required off-street parking space. 
(g)  Safety barriers. All service stations, parking lots, display or sales areas for motor vehicles of any type shall erect a safety barrier inside the street yard exclusive of driveway entrances. Such barriers shall be at least seven (7) inches in height and six (6) inches in width, and shall be of approved construction and otherwise designed to prohibit any overhang of motor vehicles in any public right-of-way. 
(h)  Combination of parking spaces on a lot. Required parking spaces for any number of separate buildings or uses may be combined in one (1) parking lot, but the required spaces assigned to one (1) use may not be assigned to another use if the uses normally operate at the same time. 
(i)  Exception to off-street parking standards. 
(1)  Central Business District. The provisions of subsection 18-526(b) shall not apply to the Central Business District, except section 18-529 and section 18-530 shall be applicable to new construction of off-street parking areas. 
(2)  Historic Districts. The provisions of subsection (b) shall not apply to properties in the Historic District Mixed Use (HDMU). The provisions of subsection (b) shall also not apply to properties in the Historic District (HD) and located within one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) feet of a government-owned parking facility where public parking is available. Conversions of residential structures resulting in increased residential density in the Historic District (HD) and Historic District-Residential (HD-R) shall meet the parking requirements for new construction in these areas. Conversions shall not be exempt from off-street parking requirements. 
(3)  Hemenway. Residential uses located within the Hemenway Redevelopment Area of the City of Wilmington shall provide one (1) parking space per unit. The required parking can be provided either off-street, or on-street, if adequate off-street parking area is not available. The city manager will determine the capability of providing off-street parking on the residential lot in order to determine if on-street parking is needed. Maps identifying the boundaries of the Hemenway Redevelopment Area may be viewed at the development services department. 
(4)  Historic mixed use buildings located in the 1945 corporate limits. The provisions of subsection (b) shall not apply to existing structures. Off-premises parking shall be encouraged through subsection 18-526(d) of this chapter. 
(5)  Religious institutions located in the 1945 corporate limits. The provisions of subsection (b) shall not apply to religious institutions that require fifty (50) or fewer parking spaces if on-street parking is available within a two-block radius. Off-premises parking shall be encouraged through subsection 18-526(d) of this chapter. 
(j)  Use of parking facilities. 
(1)  Limitations on use of required parking facilities. 
a.  Permitted use. Required parking spaces approved in accordance with this chapter shall only be used for the intermittent parking of licensed motor vehicles of employees, occupants, owners, tenants or customers utilizing the building served by said required parking space. 
b.  Storage, repair or display of any equipment or merchandise, shall not be permitted. Storage of vehicles for sale at an automobile dealership may be permitted. 
c.  All parking areas not in compliance with these requirements shall be rendered in compliance prior to September 1, 2000. 
(2)  Limitations on use of supplemental parking facilities. 
a.  Supplemental parking (parking facilities provided but not required) shall only be used for the intermittent parking of licensed motor vehicles of employees, occupants, owners, tenants or customers utilizing the building served by said parking space with exceptions described below. 
b.  Storage or repair of any equipment or merchandise shall not be permitted. Storage of vehicles for sale at an automobile dealership may be permitted. 
c.  Display and sale of any merchandise shall not be permitted except as may be approved by the city through a temporary use permit. 
d.  All parking areas not in compliance with these requirements shall be rendered in compliance prior to September 1, 2000. 
(Ord. No. O-2008-25, 4-8-08; Ord. No. O-2010-91, § 31, 12-7-10; Ord. No. O-2011-62, § 1, 8-2-11) 
Sec. 18-527. - Off-street loading. 
(a)  Location. All required loading spaces shall be located on the same lot and shall have the same zoning as the use it is to serve. No off-street loading space shall be located in a required front yard or within a triangular sight distance. Loading facilities shall be constructed so that all maneuvering will take place entirely within the property lines of the facility. Interior off-street loading spaces may be located inside the structure it serves provided the other provisions of this section, such as size and access, are met. 
(b)  Size. For uses handling goods in quantity as described in subsection 18-527(h)(1), off-street loading spaces shall have a minimum width of twelve (12) feet and a minimum length of forty-five (45) feet. For uses not handling goods in quantity as described in subsection 18-527(h)(2), off-street loading spaces shall have a minimum width of twelve (12) feet and a minimum length of twenty-five (25) feet. In all cases loading spaces shall have a minimum vertical clearance of fifteen (15) feet. 
(c)  Surfacing. All off-street loading spaces shall be paved with asphalt or concrete material, or with alternative paving material (e.g. concrete pavers, brick, "turfstone" or similar material) determined to exhibit equivalent wear resistance and load bearing characteristics as asphalt or concrete, of a type and thickness capable of carrying, without damage, the heaviest vehicle loads reasonably anticipated on such surface. Loading spaces associated with parking facilities which are exempted from the paving requirements of this chapter (see subsection 18-529(c)(4)e.) shall likewise be exempted from these paving requirements. 
(d)  Repair and service. No motor vehicle repair work or service of any kind shall be permitted in conjunction with loading facilities, except emergency repair service necessary to relocate a vehicle to a normal repair facility. 
(e)  Utilization. Off-street loading space shall not be used to satisfy the space requirements for off-street parking facilities or portions thereof, nor vice versa. 
(f)  Similar use applicable. The city manager shall apply the off-street loading requirements for the most similar use listed herein to an unspecified use. 
(g)  Access. Each off-street loading space shall be provided with unobstructed ingress and egress to a public or private street. 
(h)  Off-street loading requirements. 
(1)  Uses handling goods in quantity. Uses which normally handle large quantities of goods including, but not limited to, industrial plants, wholesale establishments, storage warehouses, freight terminals and hospitals or sanitariums, shall provide off-street loading facilities in the following amounts: 
Gross Floor Area of Establishment 
in Square Feet Required Number of Loading Spaces Less than 5,000 N/A 5,000 to 24,499 1 25,000 to 49,999 2 50,000 to 99,000 3 100,000 4  
For each additional one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of gross floor area, at least one (1) additional loading space shall be provided. 
(2)  Uses not handling goods in quantity. Commercial establishments which do not handle large quantities of goods including, but not limited to, office buildings, restaurants, auditoriums, convention halls, coliseums, exhibition halls, funeral homes, hotels and motels shall provide off-street loading facilities in the following amounts: 
Gross Floor Area of Establishment 
in Square Feet Required Number of Loading Spaces Less than 19,999 N/A 20,000 to 69,999 1 70,000 to 100,000 2  
For each additional one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of gross floor area, at least one (1) additional loading space shall be provided. 
(3)  Other uses. The city manager or the designated appropriate reviewing agency shall apply the off-street loading requirements for the most similar use listed herein to an unspecified use. 
(Ord. No. O-2012-85, Exh. A, § 35, 12-4-12) 
Sec. 18-528. - Off-street parking space schedule. 
(a)  Unless otherwise required within the following schedule all employers shall provide one (1) space per two (2) employees of the largest shift. Any visitor and/or company vehicle parking shall not be counted to meet the requirements of this provision. 
(b)  Any nonresidential and/or public assembly use that does not provide for fixed seating and/or is not a specifically listed use within any zoning district shall have its off-street parking requirements established by the city manager as follows: 
(1)  The maximum allowable occupancy number shall be determined in accordance with the North Carolina State Building Code for the proposed use; and then, 
(2)  That number for the proposed use shall be divided by three (3). The quotient of the above calculation shall be the minimum amount of off-street parking spaces to be provided. 
(c)  All nonresidential uses shall comply with the requirements of the North Carolina Building Code or General Statutes for off-street parking for the handicapped, the more stringent or higher standard shall control over the less stringent or lower standard. 
(d)  General maximum allowable parking standards. If a parking group does not contain a specific maximum limit on the number of parking spaces, the maximum allowable parking spaces shall be one hundred fifty (150) percent of the minimum parking standard for such parking group. The maximum parking requirement will not be applicable to lots of twenty (20) spaces or less. Parking provided under the footprint of a building shall not count as additional parking above the maximum. Parking provided in stand-alone parking structures shall not count toward the maximum except those spaces on the ground level of the structure. 
    Parking in excess of essential site improvements as defined in Article 15 up to the maximum may be allowed with the options listed: 
(1)  Pervious paving materials used only on sites where soils are suitable for infiltration; and/or 
(2)  Runoff from additional parking area is managed by at least one (1) of the following techniques (refer to: NCDENR Best Management Practices Manual for design criteria): bioretention area; filter strip; sand filter; and or grassed swales. 
    An applicant may apply to the technical review committee or appropriate reviewing body for up to twenty-five (25) percent of parking over the maximum provided that the following conditions are met: 
(1)  All parking in excess of essential site improvements meets the above conditions. 
(2)  The applicant requesting the additional parking above the maximum submits information that justifies the number of parking spaces being proposed, including estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers and/or other reliable data. The information shall document the source of data used to develop the recommendation. 
(3)  The applicant demonstrates that no other parking alternatives exist, including shared parking opportunities with neighboring properties. 
(e)  For manufacturing and warehousing uses containing a minimum (cumulative) structure size of twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet and which are not generally dependent on walk-in trade for their business operations, the parking requirement may be reduced to a minimum of 1:15 parking spaces per employee on the shift of the average greatest employment. 
(f)  Bicycle parking. Each new multifamily, commercial, or office development or major redevelopment requiring twenty-five (25) or more automobile parking spaces shall make provisions for parking a minimum of five (5) bicycles. Each additional one hundred (100) automobile parking spaces above the twenty-five (25) minimum shall require provisions for parking an additional five (5) bicycles up to a bicycle parking system that can accommodate a maximum of twenty (20) bicycles. The bicycle parking provisions shall allow for bicyclists to secure their vehicle against theft. Bicycle parking facilities shall be provided within two hundred (200) feet of the primary entrance to the facility. In the event of multiple entrances, bicycle-parking facilities shall be dispersed for easy access to the multiple entrances. 
(g)  Parking studies. Some land uses have widely varying parking demand characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single off-street parking standard. A developer proposing to develop or expand such a use may be required to submit a parking study that provides justification for the number of off-street parking spaces proposed. The technical review committee shall review this study and any other traffic engineering and planning data relevant to the establishment of an appropriate off-street parking standard for the proposed use. A parking study must include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) and/or other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study must document the source of data used to develop the recommendations. After reviewing the parking study, the technical review committee shall establish the off-street parking standard for the proposed use. 
(h)  Alternative parking plan to meet minimum parking requirements. An alternative parking plan represents a proposal to meet off-street parking and transportation access needs by means other than providing parking spaces on-site in accordance with section 18-532. Applicants who wish to provide fewer off-street parking spaces than required pursuant to section 18-528 and/or section 18-532 shall secure approval by the technical review committee of an alternative parking plan, in accordance with the standards of this subsection. 
(1)  Procedures: 
a.  Plan contents. Alternative parking plans shall be submitted in a form established by the city manager and made available to the public. At a minimum, such plans must detail the type of alternative proposed and the rationale for such a proposal. 
b.  Review and administrative approval. The technical review committee is authorized to review and act on alternative parking plans if the plan proposes a reduction of off-street parking spaces. 
(2)  Eligible alternatives. The technical review committee shall be authorized to consider and approve any alternative to providing off-street parking spaces on the site of the subject development if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed plan will protect surrounding neighborhoods, maintain traffic circulation patterns and promote quality urban design at least as well as a plan that complies with otherwise applicable off-street parking standards. The following alternatives are intended to serve as example s of the types of alternatives that may be approved. 
a.  Bicycle parking. The technical review committee may authorize a reduction in the number of required off-street parking spaces for developments or uses that provide bicycle parking in addition to the required number of bicycle parking spaces or that make special provisions to accommodate bicyclists. Examples of accommodations include bicycle lockers, employee shower facilities and dressing areas for employees. 
b.  Valet parking. The technical review committee may authorize valet parking as a means of satisfying otherwise applicable off-street parking standards. 
i.  An automobile must be retrievable from its parking space with the movement of no more than two (2) additional vehicles; and 
ii.  The technical review committee must determine from the best information available that the valet parking will not cause interference with the public use of streets or ways or imperil the public safety. 
(3)  Transportation management plan. The technical review committee may authorize a reduction in the number of required off-street parking spaces for developments or uses that institute and commit to maintain a transportation management program in accordance with the standards of this section. 
a.  Required study. The applicant must submit a study that clearly indicates the types of transportation management activities and measures proposed. 
b.  Transportation management activities. There are no limitations on the types of transportation management activities for which reductions may be granted from otherwise required off-street parking ratios. 
The following measures are a guide to eligible transportation management activities: 
i.  Transportation coordinator. The appointment of a transportation coordinator with responsibility for disseminating information on ride-sharing and other transportation options may be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. In addition to acting as liaisons, transportation coordinators must be available to attend meetings and training sessions with transit providers. 
ii.  Off-peak work hours. Employers that institute off-peak work schedules, allowing employees to arrive and depart at times other than the peak commute period, may be eligible for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. The peak morning commute period is defined as 7:30 to 9:00 a.m. The afternoon peak period is defined as 4:30 to 6:00 p.m. 
iii.  Preferential parking. The provision of specially marked spaces for each registered car pool and van pool may be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. 
iv.  Financial incentives. The provision of cash or in-kind financial incentives for employees commuting by car pool, van pool and transit may be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable parking requirements. 
(Ord. No. 0-2008-25, 4-8-08; Ord. No. O-2012-85, Exh. A, §§ 36, 37, 12-4-12) 
Sec. 18-529. - Off-street parking design. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect and promote the public health, safety and general welfare by requiring safe and adequate design of parking lots and the landscaping of such facilities which will: 
(1)  Help to reduce wind and air turbulence, heat and noise and glare; 
(2)  Act as a natural drainage system lessening storm water drainage problems and soil erosion, 
(3)  Provide shade; 
(4)  Conserve and stabilize property values and otherwise facilitate the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious community; and 
(5)  Relieve the blighted appearance of parking lots and generally preserve a healthy and pleasant environment. 
(b)  Parking lot plan. 
(1)  Prior to any work being done or any building or driveway permit being issued, all off-street parking facilities of five (5) or more spaces and/or twenty-five hundred (2,500) square feet constructed, reconstructed, revised or enlarged shall have a plan of the facility reviewed by the city manager or his designee for compliance with General Statutes, city ordinances and the provisions of the city's Technical Standards and Specifications Manual. General maintenance such as sealing, repainting, or restriping that does not involve any modifications to the existing parking lot, including drive aisles, driveways, loading spaces, etc. and where the number of parking spaces does not change is not subject to review under this section. 
(2)  The plan shall show the number, size and location of spaces; arrangements of circulation aisles; locations of driveways; provisions for vehicular and pedestrian circulation; locations of sidewalks and curbs on or adjacent to the facility; barriers or wheel stops; interior, perimeter and street side landscaping; locations, legend and details of signs; lighting standards; typical cross-section of pavement; storm drainage facilities; and other pertinent information necessary to indicate compliance with this section. 
(c)  Design criteria. 
(1)  Maneuvering. All parking and loading facilities shall be constructed so that all maneuvering will take place entirely within the property lines of the facility. 
(2)  Barriers. Each parking space located at the perimeter of a parking facility shall be equipped with a curb, wheel stop, or similar device to prevent vehicle encroachment beyond property lines of parking lots and into pedestrian ways or traffic aisles. 
(3)  Vision clearance. Parking lot design shall comply with the vision clearance provisions set forth in section 18-556 herein. 
(4)  [New, enlarged or redesigned parking facilities.] Except as provided in subsection 18-526(b) of this chapter, all new, enlarged or redesigned parking facilities shall comply with the standards set forth in the city's Technical Standards and Specifications Manual and the following: 
a.  A standard parking space shall have a minimum width of eight and one-half (81/2) feet and a minimum length of eighteen (18) feet. 
b.  Parking spaces for small vehicles may be provided in lieu of standard parking spaces for parking decks and for residential, nonmedical office, warehousing, and industrial uses. However, no more than twenty-five (25) percent of the total number of required parking spaces shall be small vehicle spaces. The minimum width of a small vehicle space shall be eight (8) feet and its minimum length shall be sixteen (16) feet. Small vehicle parking spaces shall be designated by proper signage alerting drivers to the limitation of space size. Small vehicle parking spaces are not permitted in conjunction with other uses than those listed above. 
c.  Spaces larger than the standard size are permitted, provided at least the minimum number of spaces required are furnished. 
d.  All nonresidential uses shall comply with the requirements of the North Carolina Building Code or General Statutes for off-street parking spaces for the handicapped, then more stringent or higher standard shall control over the less stringent or lower standard. 
e.  All parking facilities containing twenty-five (25) or more spaces or stalls shall be paved with concrete or asphalt material, or with alternative paving material (e.g., concrete pavers, brick, "turfstone" or similar material) determined to exhibit equivalent wear resistance and load bearing characteristics as asphalt or concrete, according to the parking lot standards of the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual. There are three (3) exceptions to these requirements: Parking facilities in the Historic District (which may be surfaced with other materials, recognized as historical surfacing materials in the Historic District Design Guidelines); "overflow" parking facilities (i.e., parking facilities providing parking in excess of the number of spaces required in section 18-532 of this chapter for the uses for which the parking is provided); and those parking facilities determined by the city manager or designee to serve establishments for which infrequent use of the parking facilities is anticipated (e.g., for certain assembly uses-Churches, recreational areas, etc.). These latter two (2) types of parking facilities may be surfaced with material deemed appropriate for such facilities on a case-by-case basis by the city manager or designee upon consultation with the traffic engineering division and engineering department. 
f.  All parking facilities containing between five (5) and twenty-four (24) spaces or stalls, inclusive, may be paved or surfaced with a stone material in accordance with the requirements set forth in the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual; provided that all spaces set aside for parking by handicapped persons must comply with all applicable codes, ordinances and technical requirements, and paved access to a handicapped-accessible entrance to the principal building must be provided; provided further that all parking facilities surfaced in accordance with this paragraph must otherwise comply with the requirements of the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual. 
g.  Alternative parking surfaces. The city may require that parking proposed in excess of the minimum standard be stabilized grass parking or an alternative permeable surface appropriate to the specific site. Alternative parking surfaces shall be adequately maintained to provide a stable parking surface. 
h.  Shared parking study. Those wishing to use shared parking as a means of satisfying off-street parking requirements must submit a shared parking analysis to the technical review committee that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. The study must address, at a minimum, the size and type of the development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces. A shared parking plan will be enforced through written agreement among all owners of record. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be approved by the city attorney and submitted to the city for recordation on forms made available in the office of the city. Recordation of the agreement must take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. A shared parking agreement may be revoked only if required off-street parking spaces can be otherwise provided, in accordance with section 18-532. 
i.  Water-oriented space size. Water-oriented (boat slip) parking spaces shall have a minimum width of ten (10) feet and a minimum length of sixteen (16) feet. Space adjacent to a floating dock shall have a minimum length of sixteen (16) feet. Water-oriented parking spaces shall be identified by signs. Water-oriented parking shall consist of a minimum of two (2) boat slips but shall not account for more than ten (10) percent of the total number of spaces required for any use. 
(5)  Drainage. No stormwater drainage from a parking facility shall cross the surface of any adjoining public right-of-way to reach a storm water drainage system.

Sec. 18-530. - Driveways. 
(a)  General. 
(1)  Only driveways designed, approved, constructed and surfaced in accordance with the provisions herein shall be allowed to provide motor vehicle access to or from any property upon which a building has been constructed, reconstructed or physically altered. All driveways shall be paved with either asphalt or concrete, or with alternative paving material (e.g., concrete pavers, brick, "turfstone" or similar material) determined to exhibit equivalent wear resistance and load bearing characteristics as asphalt or concrete, according to the standards of the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual for parking lots, except for driveways in the Wilmington Historic District (which may be surfaced with brick as provided in subsection 18-530(e) herein or with other materials recognized as historic surfacing materials in the Historic District Design Guidelines) or for driveways which serve "overflow" parking facilities (i.e., parking facilities providing parking in excess of the number of spaces of this chapter for those uses for which the parking is provided or for parking lots in which other surfacing materials are permitted) (see subsection 18-529(c)(4)e.). 
(2)  Before a building permit is issued for the construction, reconstruction or change in use of any building or land used for purposes other than a single-family or two-family residence, all driveways shall be reviewed and approved by the city engineer. Private driveways serving single-family and two-family dwellings shall not be regulated by the provisions of this article. "Construction, reconstruction or change in use" refers to those improvements made to the site involving overall structure size or to changes in use which would require the addition of one (1) or more parking spaces under the provisions of section 18-532; it is not intended to refer to construction activities which merely involve changes to exterior architectural features (e.g., painting, addition of siding, roofing activities, etc.) as defined in Article 15. An applicant for a driveway connection shall be required to construct in accordance with the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual and dedicate to the public medians, acceleration and deceleration lanes, and/or traffic storage lanes when the city engineer determines that the improvements will serve the traffic of the proposed driveway and the anticipated volume of traffic using the proposed driveway may significantly interfere with the flow of traffic on abutting or surrounding public streets. 
(3)  When the use of any driveway has been permanently discontinued, the property owner of that driveway shall, at his expense, replace all necessary curbs, gutters, aprons, sidewalks, and appurtenances thereto, within sixty (60) days of receipt of a written notice from the city engineer. 
(4)  No driveway shall conflict with any municipal facility such as traffic signal standards, catch basins, fire hydrants, crosswalks, loading zones, bus stops, utility poles, fire-alarm supports, meter boxes and sewer cleanouts or other necessary structures, except with the express approval of the appropriate city officials. Any adjustments to municipal facilities to avoid such conflicts shall be at the expense of the driveway applicant. 
(b)  Permit requirements. 
(1)  A permit must be obtained from the city engineer prior to the removal, alteration or construction of any curb, driveway, gutter and/or pavement or prior to the performance of any other work in any public or private street. Conditions governing the issuance of such a permit are: 
a.  A continuing indemnity bond with sufficient surety acceptable to the city may be required of the party performing the work. All work must be done in conformity with the standards established herein. 
b.  The city shall be indemnified for any damages it might sustain as a result of the breach of condition above. The damages payable to the city shall be the amount required to make such improvement conform to city standards. 
(2)  A fee in accordance with the city's adopted fee schedule shall be paid to the city at the time the application for a driveway permit is made. 
(c)  Submission of plans. 
(1)  Two (2) copies of plans showing the location and dimensions of all proposed improvements shall be filed with the city engineer for his approval prior to the issuance of a driveway permit for uses other than single-family or two-family residential. 
(2)  All design and construction of driveways shall conform to the requirements of the city's Technical Standards and Specifications Manual, except for those driveways within the Historic District which shall conform to the requirements of the Historic District Design Guidelines. (See also subsection 18-530(a)(1) for acceptable modifications to the surfacing requirements of the [city's] Technical Standards and Specifications Manual.) 
(d)  Driveway permit inspection. Once the driveway permit is duly issued, the supervisor of the driveway construction site shall keep the permit available for on-the-job inspection by authorized personnel of the city. The inspector or other authorized representative of the city shall have the authority to require the immediate stoppage of work not performed either in accordance with the approved plans or under the requirements of this chapter and may order the nonconforming installations be corrected and/or blocked. 
(e)  Brick driveways. 
(1)  In the historic districts and Central Business District brick driveways consisting of smooth, hard-burned clay bricks with an appropriate concrete base conforming to the design standards of the city engineer will be allowed. 
(2)  In the event repairs are required after brick driveways are installed due to utility replacement or other construction work, the driveway applicant shall pay that portion of the repair cost which exceeds the cost of repair using standard concrete six (6) inches in thickness. Normal maintenance or replacement will be the responsibility of the driveway applicant.

Sec. 18-533. - Off-street parking and/or storage of certain vehicles. 
(a)  Manufactured housing. The off-street parking or storage of any manufactured housing shall be prohibited in any district except: 
(1)  The MHP, Manufactured Housing Park District approved under this Land Development Code or the New Hanover County Mobile Home Parks Ordinance; or 
(2)  An establishment for sales, servicing, maintenance and/or manufacturing of mobile homes. 
(b)  Trailers. Any trailer over twenty-five (25) feet in length shall not be parked or stored in any residential, O&I, or CB District except in an enclosed building. Trailers less than twenty-five (25) feet in length shall only be parked behind the plane of the front facade of the principal building on any residential lot. A maximum of two (2) trailers are permitted on any such lot, only one of which may be parked between the front and rear facades of the principal building. If the trailer and/or any equipment loaded on the trailer exceeds six (6) feet in height, it shall only be parked behind the plane of the rear facade. This regulation shall not be interpreted to prohibit the loading and unloading of commercial trailers in any such district. 
(c)  Commercial vehicles. One (1) commercial vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of not more than ten thousand (10,000) pounds may be parked on any residential lot containing a principal building, provided that such vehicle is parked off the street, is parked in a delineated parking area (e.g., a driveway or a garage), and is used by a resident of the premises. In all other cases, the parking of a commercial vehicle in any residential district is prohibited. This regulation shall not be interpreted to prohibit commercial vehicles from loading or unloading in any residential district. 
(d)  Recreational vehicles. Parking or storage of recreational vehicle(s) shall be permitted as accessory to a principal residential use only in accordance with the following conditions: 
(1)  Unless stored in a garage, carport, or accessory building, recreational vehicles shall be parked or stored behind the portion of the principal building closest to the street; provided, however, that parking shall be permitted anywhere on the premises or on an adjacent street (if otherwise lawful), not to exceed twenty-four (24) hours. 
(2)  In any side yard not adjacent to a street, no such recreational vehicles may be parked or stored if it exceeds six (6) feet in height above the ground; provided, however, masts, antennas, vent stacks, windshields or other minor accessories may exceed this height limit. 
(3)  Recreational vehicles exceeding the limitations set forth in subsection (2) above, shall be parked or stored outdoors only in the rear yard. Any equipment so stored shall be subject to the accessory building requirements in Article 6. 
(4)  No recreational vehicles parked or stored on a residential lot shall be in such location for living, sleeping, housekeeping or business purposes. 
(5)  The city manager may conditionally allow front yard or side yard storage of recreational vehicles if all of the following conditions are present: 
a.  The recreational vehicle cannot be stored in the rear yard due to dimensional restrictions, such as those created by existing trees or structures blocking access. The applicant shall provide photographic and dimensional evidence to the city manager. 
b.  The recreational vehicle is stored at a minimum of two hundred (200) feet from the frontage line. 
c.  Sufficient vegetation or screening exists to screen the recreational vehicle from adjacent property. Sufficient vegetation or screening is defined as fifty (50) percent opacity to a minimum height of six (6) feet.

Secs. 18-534-18-540. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE 10. - EXCEPTIONALLY DESIGNED PROJECTS 

Sec. 18-541. - Purpose. 
    This article applies to development within areas classified as Watershed Resource Protection or Conservation Areas in the Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) Land Classification Map, and will be used to determine density increases under Article 5 of this chapter. In areas identified as Watershed Resource Protection or Conservation on the most recently adopted CAMA Land Classification Map, impervious surface area for any residential development is limited to twenty-five (25) percent of the total buildable area with allowable increases subject to the conditions in this article. In the conservation land class, residential density is also limited to two and one-half (2.5) units per acre with increases as allowed under this article and applicable zoning district. Impervious surface area for any redevelopment project that meets all current LDC standards is limited to the existing impervious area, with allowable increases in density and/or coverage subject to the conditions in this article. 
(Ord. No. 0-2006-112, § 1, 11-21-06) 
Sec. 18-542. - General. 
    This provision specifies the development practices criteria necessary to increase density on lands classified as Watershed Resource Protection or Conservation. Greater development density shall be allowed if certain conditions are met. These "development bonuses" are intended as incentives for developers to practice environmentally preferred design techniques. An incremental bonus of additional dwelling units per acre and additional impervious surface will be allowed for projects that reach the threshold points earned through adding features of an "exceptionally designed project", provided the baseline criteria are met. The provisions of this article do not apply to sites zoned MX. 
(Ord. No. 0-2006-112, § 2, 11-21-06) 
Sec. 18-543. - Baseline criteria. 
    The following are the necessary elements of exceptionally designed projects. These items are the baseline requirements which must be met in order for any development to be considered as an exceptionally designed project. 
(a)  Site assessment. A detailed natural resource inventory and assessment shall be prepared before the conceptual site design is developed to identify and prioritize the natural resources requiring management through project planning. The inventory shall identify high-quality natural areas as part of the site analysis and shall be used to incorporate site sensitivity into the design. 
(1)  The assessment shall involve professionals of the disciplines necessary to adequately assess any aspect to the satisfaction of the city manager. 
(2)  The assessment shall list the names and qualifications of the persons who were primarily responsible for preparing any part of the assessment. 
(3)  The assessment shall provide a concise inventory of existing environmental and natural site attributes and a full and accurate disclosure of the environment as it would be altered by the project under consideration 
(4)  The assessment shall inform decision makers and the public of reasonable alternatives that would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance the quality of the environment. 
(5)  The assessment shall describe the direct and indirect consequences of the proposed project and any conflicts between proposed project development activities and federal, state, and local rules and regulations intended to protect the environment. 
(6)  Site context maps shall be provided to show the relationship of the site to patterns of existing development and/or natural features on other properties within two thousand (2,000) feet radius around outside boundaries of the project site. The map must reflect an awareness of possible incompatibilities and illustrate potential opportunities for creating interconnected networks of streets, trails, habitats, and greenway lands. 
(b)  Development plans. A conceptual site development plan drawn to scale must be submitted to the development services department that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city manager that all the requirements of this section are met. The plan must technically and visually illustrate the development potential achievable for the project site, and demonstrate that the innovative design proposal will achieve a net improvement in the functional value of the streams and wetlands and their buffers over that existing on the subject property and beyond that which is achievable using the provisions of Article 14, Division III herein. The plan must clearly demonstrate how the project meets the criteria in this section to qualify for any density adjustment. 
(c)  Low Impact Development (LID) techniques. The project shall manage stormwater onsite through Low Impact Development (LID) techniques. 
(1)  Definition. LID combines resource conservation, a hydrologically functional site design, and pollution prevention measures to reduce development impacts on water quality and to better replicate natural watershed hydrology. Through a variety of small-scale site design techniques integrated in a series, LID controls runoff discharge, volume, frequency, and quality to mimic predevelopment runoff and hydrologic conditions. 
(2)  The following elements are necessary in order for a project to be considered as including LID design and qualify for any density adjustments in this section: 
a.  Small scale techniques to manage precipitation as close as possible to where it hits the ground. 
b.  Strategic placement of linked lot-level controls that are customized to address specific pollutant load and stormwater timing, flow rate, and volume. 
c.  Use of devices that allow infiltrating rainfall water to groundwater and evaporating rainwater back to the atmosphere (raingardens, cisterns, dry wells, filter strips, etc.) to reduce runoff volume. 
d.  Site fingerprinting (minimal disturbance techniques) to minimize the extent of clearing and grading, thereby minimizing the hydrologic impacts. Site fingerprinting includes restricting ground disturbance by identifying the smallest possible area for disturbance and clearly delineating it on the site. With site fingerprinting, landcover impacts are reduced through minimal disturbance techniques that include the following: 
i.  Reduce paving and compaction of highly permeable soils to preserve absorptive capacity. 
ii.  Minimizing the size of construction easements and material storage areas, and siting stockpiles within the development envelope during the construction phase of a project. 
iii.  Delineating and flagging the smallest site disturbance area possible to minimize soil compaction on the site and restricting temporary storage of construction equipment in these areas. 
iv.  Siting building layout and clearing and grading practices to avoid removal of existing trees of all sizes where possible. 
v.  Minimizing imperviousness of site by reducing the total area of paved surfaces. 
vi.  Disconnecting as much impervious area as possible by breaking it up with pervious surfaces (grass filter strips in parking lots, raingardens, swales, etc.) to increase opportunities for infiltration and reduce water runoff flow. 
vii.  Maintaining existing topography and associated drainage divides to encourage dispersed flow paths. 
Sec. 18-544. - Scaled criteria. 
    The following are scaled development practices criteria, which to the degree they are met may qualify a development to be considered as an exceptionally designed project for the purpose of awarding density bonuses. Specific items are given weighted scores in Table 1. Each level within Table 1 represents an additional five (5) points (e.g., A1 = 5, A2 = 10, A3 = 15, etc.). The overall score shall be determined by adding all points acquired within each Area in Table 1. Incremental increases in density and/or impervious surface area may be permitted pursuant to Table 2, based on the score awarded by incorporating the specific improvements. Scoring shall not credit the same element of the project toward points in more than one (1) area. 
(a)  Wetland function. Ensure the perpetual maintenance of characteristic wetland functions and habitat through preservation of contiguous natural wetlands. To qualify for points, the wetland feature to be preserved must be greater than one (1) acre in size and must be wetland area that is not otherwise subject to protection under some other local, state or federal regulatory provision. Additional bonus points may be earned by enhancing or restoring impacted wetlands or constructing new wetlands. To qualify, wetland restoration, enhancement, and construction must conform to the Stream Mitigation Guidelines published April 2003 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Technical Guide for Stream Work in North Carolina published by the North Carolina DENR Divisions of Water Quality and Land Resources in April 2001, or subsequent revisions. 
(b)  Shoreline/riparian/wetland buffers. Increase the setback of buildings, improvements, and new structures such as houses, sheds, and other buildings and hardened surfaces, etc. from lakes, streams, and wetlands. Increase protected areas, or vegetated buffers, around aquatic resources. The buffer and setback is measured perpendicularly from the most landward limit of the top of the stream bank (or from the normal pool elevation of reservoirs or the edge of the wetland resource as determined by the jurisdictional line for 404 wetlands or the delineation of the applicable conservation resource(s) on the site inventory). To qualify for any density bonus consideration, the setback or vegetated buffer must be beyond that which is otherwise required by local, state or federal regulatory provisions as set forth in Table 1 of this chapter. 
(c)  Impervious surfaces. Limit the amount of imperviousness of the development by use of reduced pavement width and length in streets and driveways, planted strips between parking lot rows and other methods which may be submitted for approval to the city manager. Reduce impervious surface from building and parking footprints by use of multistory buildings and structured parking, shared parking, and grassed overflow parking. 
(d)  Porous pavement. Decreased imperviousness of hardened surfaces through use of porous pavement surfaces. To qualify, soil evaluations must show that permeability is suitable for pavement to properly function to infiltrate water from rainfall into the underlying soils. Only those surfaces that are not required to be made pervious by the parking standards are considered in calculating the percentage pavement in this category. 
(e)  Flood zone storage capacity. Credit may be given to projects that maintain floodplain storage capacity and reduce uses in the floodplain that are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards. To qualify, projects may not include filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or decrease floodplain storage volumes. 
(f)  Constructed wetlands. Development of constructed wetlands for replacement of lost wetland functions and habitat and for use in stormwater quality control. To qualify, the constructed wetlands must be constructed in accordance with North Carolina Division of Water Quality Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual or some other design approved by the city manager and must be planted with appropriate native vegetation. Project plans must demonstrate that the hydrology, soils, and vegetation are appropriate to support the wetland feature proposed. 
(g)  Stormwater controls. Reduce total pollutant load leaving the site and minimize changes in overall site hydrology by use of LID techniques, or a combination of LID and conventional techniques. To qualify for bonus points in this category, the following guidelines shall be met: 
(1)  Site design and impervious cover reduction practices shall be used to the maximum extent practicable to minimize runoff volume; 
(2)  Serial combinations of the following techniques shall be used to result in a post-development time of concentration (Tc) equal to the predevelopment Tc: 
a.  Vegetated swale conveyance of runoff; 
b.  Disconnecting impervious surfaces; 
c.  Lengthening of flow pat; 
d.  Increasing resistance (roughness) of flow path; 
e.  Maximize use of sheet flow over vegetated surface; 
f.  Increase flow over pervious soils to increase filtration; 
g.  Flattening grades; 
h.  Use of decentralized bio-infiltration, and infiltration, and storage (cisterns); 
i.  Iterations and combinations of the above as approved by the city manager. 
(3)  The entire retention storage volume must be retained and infiltrated. 
(4)  All added landscaping areas shall be made hydrologically functional for retention. 
(5)  The stormwater management plan shall include an approved maintenance plan and schedule. 
(h)  Undeveloped open space. Conserve in perpetuity at least ten (10) percent of the site (minimum of one (1) acre) in undeveloped, undisturbed natural open space. This area must be protected from disturbance during the construction process (e.g., not graded, driven upon, nor used for construction storage, staging, nor parking) and must be permanently protected by dedicating to the city or third party approved by the city manager, by restrictive covenants, by a conservation easement, or by some other method approved by the city. Areas that are required to be set aside for conservation areas, or active recreation or areas that are cleared for utility easement can not be counted to qualify for bonus points in this category. Areas that are required to be protected in a natural state by any provision of the city or other regulatory program will not count toward meeting the qualifications for this category. Previously disturbed areas that are revegetated to predisturbance plant community types may qualify for credit in this category. 
(i)  Greenways. Establish interconnecting greenway corridors and opportunities for future connection. The plans must assure connection and access across the property for any relevant greenway corridor that is part of a greenway network, current or future. The land of this corridor may be dedicated (deeded) to the city or a conservation agency or held in common ownership by a homeowners' association and must be a minimum of thirty (30) feet in width or of a wider width as necessary to be consistent with the intended use, planned use on adjacent properties, or use identified in any city or county greenway plans. The project plan shall include a maintenance plan to be included in the homeowners' association documents if ownership is held by a homeowners' association. 
(j)  Habitat. Preserve and protect blocks of intact native habitat. 
(1)  Qualifying habitat includes: 
a.  Native woodlands; 
b.  Unregulated wetlands; 
c.  Unique habitats as defined by the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program; 
d.  Ecologically highest quality natural areas as identified by the New Hanover County Natural Areas Inventory; or 
e.  Target preservation areas as identified by any City of Wilmington natural areas preservation plan. 
(2)  Areas that are required to be protected by any provision of the city or other regulatory program do not qualify for this category. To qualify, the area must be a minimum of one-half (1/2) acre and must be dedicated to the city or another agency approved by the city manager or must be protected by a conservation easement. 
(k)  Shared facilities/utilities. Provide shared-use (rather than individually owned) facilities, such as shared community boating facilities or water access, whenever possible. To qualify, the facility may only be made available to residents within the subdivision and must be developed in accordance with any other applicable regulations. 
(l)  Resource enhancement. Undertake projects such as bank stabilization, riparian buffer restoration, in-channel habitat improvements, and similar projects that improve or maintain the quality of a significant natural resource or reduce the project's impact. Qualifying projects must demonstrate an improvement in the quality of at least one (1) ecological function or value of the resource, include a monitoring and maintenance plan, and the area must be protected by a covenant or conservation easement. Restoration must be performed in conformance with the Stream Mitigation Guidelines published April 2003 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Guidelines for Riparian Buffer Restoration published by the North Carolina DENR Divisions of Water Quality, and Technical Guide for Stream Work in North Carolina published by the North Carolina DENR Divisions of Water Quality and Land Resources. 
(m)  Xeriscaping. Utilize xeriscaping and drought tolerant landscape plantings on a project to reduce irrigation and fertilizer needs. The term xeriscape refers to a water conservative approach to landscaping using selection of plants native to the area or to similar climates whose growing requirements are appropriate to the local climate, placement of plants to minimize watering requirements, and measures to avoid wasting water to evaporation and run-off. To be considered for points under this category, the project plan shall demonstrate that it is consistent with the seven (7) basic principles of xeriscaping: planning and natural design, limiting turf areas, selecting and zoning plants appropriately, improving the soil, using mulches, irrigating efficiently, and appropriate maintenance. The plan shall include a schedule of maintenance.

DIVISION I. - PURPOSE AND SCOPE 

Sec. 18-566. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article shall be to coordinate the type, placement, and physical dimensions of signs within the different zoning districts; to recognize the commercial communication requirements of all sectors of the business community; to promote both renovation and proper maintenance of signs; and to guarantee equal treatment under the law through accurate record keeping and consistent enforcement. The general objectives of these standards are to promote the health, safety, welfare, convenience and enjoyment of the public, and in part, to achieve the following: 
(a)  Safety. To promote the safety of persons and property by providing that signs: 
(1)  Do not create a hazard due to collapse, fire, decay, collision, or abandonment; 
(2)  Do not obstruct fire-fighting or police surveillance; and 
(3)  Do not create traffic hazards by confusing or distracting motorists, or by impairing the driver's ability to see pedestrians, obstacles, or other vehicles, or to read traffic signs. 
(b)  Communications efficiency. To promote the efficient transfer of information in sign messages by providing that: 
(1)  Those signs which provide messages and information most needed and sought by the public are given priorities; 
(2)  Businesses and services may identify themselves; 
(3)  Customers and other persons may effectively locate a business or service; 
(4)  No person or group is arbitrarily denied the use of the sight lines from the public right-of-way for communication purposes; and 
(5)  Persons exposed to signs are not overwhelmed by the number or size of messages presented and are able to exercise freedom of choice to observe or ignore said messages, according to the observer's purpose. 
(c)  Landscape quality and preservation. To protect the public welfare and to enhance the appearance and economic value of the landscape by providing that signs: 
(1)  Do not interfere with scenic views;

A minimum of one thousand (1,000) linear feet between qualified signs on the same side of the road, unless the relocated and/or reconstructed sign replaces a sign on the same lot that is constructed on multiple poles. A sign is located on the same side of a road as another sign if the sign structures are adjacent to the same side of the road and the sign faces are oriented to the same direction of traffic. 
b.  A minimum of five hundred (500) linear feet from any locally or nationally designated historic district, unless the relocated and/or reconstructed sign replaces a sign on the same lot that is constructed on multiple poles.

ARTICLE 13. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT 
DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 18-636. - Title. 
    This article shall be known as the Floodplain Management Regulations of the City of Wilmington, North Carolina, and may be referred to as the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. O-2018-46, § 1, 7-17-18) 
Sec. 18-637. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to the health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require the uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
    The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of City of Wilmington are subject to periodic inundation that may result in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which may adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards. 
    The objectives of this article are to: protect human life, safety, and health; minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions; minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas; minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding; make flood insurance available to the community through the National Flood Insurance Program; maintain the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas; and ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area.

(a)  The board of adjustment shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this article. The board shall provide appropriate forms and information to person applying for a variance to enable them to furnish all necessary information to the board. The variance request shall be written and shall include information as to all of the factors set forth in subsection (b) and any other pertinent information. 
(b)  In passing upon such applications, the board of adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this section, and the following factors: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and Floodplain Management Program for that area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(c)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on lots of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with an existing structure constructed below the base flood level, providing the factors set forth in subsection 18-649(b) above have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(d)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. 
(e)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for: 
(1)  The reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places upon the determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and that the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(2)  Water dependent facilities if determined to meet the definition as defined in this chapter, provided variances within the floodway will not increase flood levels during the base flood discharge, the requested variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief, such facilities are protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threat to public safety. 
(3)  Any other type of development provided it meets the requirements of this section. 
(g)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and, a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(4)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest flood elevation. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(5)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
(6)  No variance shall be approved for any new solid waste disposal facilities, hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities in the 100-year floodplain except in accordance with the following standards: Provided that a structure or tank for chemical or fuel storage incidental to a use that is allowed under this section or to the operation of a water treatment plant or wastewater treatment facility may be located in a 100-year floodplain only if the structure or tank is either elevated above base flood elevation or designed to be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. The city must notify the Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety of its intention to grant a variance at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to granting the variance.

(e)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in section 18-646, subsections 18-666(c), (d) and (f) of this article with the most current version of North Carolina's "National Flood Insurance Program V-Zone Certification" form. In addition, prior to the certificate of compliance/occupancy issuance, a registered professional engineer or architect shall certify the finished construction is compliant with the design, specifications, and plans for VE zone construction. 
(f)  Fill shall not be used for structural support. Up to two (2) feet of non-compacted and non-stabilized fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping and aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, thereby rendering the building free of obstruction prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. Design plans shall be submitted in accordance with section 18-646 of this article. The floodplain administrator may approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist which demonstrates that the following factors have been satisfied: 
(1)  Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
(2)  Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave deflection to adjacent properties; and 
(3)  Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping. 
(g)  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage. 
(h)  No manufactured homes shall be permitted except in an existing manufactured housing park. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured housing park provided the anchoring and elevation standards are in compliance with this section of ordinance. 
(i)  Recreational vehicles may be permitted in coastal high hazard areas provided that they meet the recreational vehicle criteria of subsection 18-660(e) of this article and the temporary structure provisions of subsection 18-660(f) of this article. 
(j)  A deck that is structurally attached to a building or structure shall have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation and any supporting members that extend below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall comply with the foundation requirements that apply to the building or structure, which shall be designed to accommodate any increased loads resulting from the attached deck. The increased loads must be considered in the design of the primary structure and included in the required V-Zone certification. 
(k)  A deck or patio that is located below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be structurally independent from buildings or structures and their foundation systems, and shall be designed and constructed either to remain intact and in place during design flood conditions or to break apart into small pieces to minimize debris during flooding that is capable of causing structural damage to the building or structure or to adjacent buildings or structures. 
(l)  In coastal high hazard areas, development activities other than buildings and structures shall be permitted only if also authorized by the appropriate state or local authority; if located outside the footprint of, and not structurally attached to, buildings and structures; and if analyses prepared by qualified registered design professionals demonstrate no harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave runup and wave reflection that would increase damage to adjacent buildings and structures. Such other development activities include but are not limited to: 1) bulkheads, seawalls, retaining walls, revetments, and similar erosion control structures; and 2) fences, unless designed and constructed to fail under flood conditions less than the design flood or otherwise function to avoid obstruction of floodwaters.

All persons who may have occasion in the prosecution of their work to place material, machinery or anything else in any street or on any part of any sidewalk in the city may be required to deposit with the director of finance a certified check or cash for such sum as the city engineer may deem sufficient to cover the cost of repairing any damage to the sidewalk, before the commencement of such work. Such check or cash shall be held by the director of finance as a pledge that said contractor or other person will at once repair, or cause to be repaired, any damage to such things or both, and deduct the cost thereof from the amount of such check or cash deposit, and the residue thereof, if any, shall be paid to the person entitled to receive the same. Where the amount deposited is insufficient, the difference due shall be paid by the responsible party. Persons making deposits hereunder, having complied with the requirements hereof, shall upon the final cleaning up of the street or sidewalk area used or the repair of any items damaged, receive a release from the city engineer. 
Sec. 18-703. - Protection of pedestrians by persons constructing or demolishing buildings.

PART 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 18-731. - Title. 
    This division of article 14 of the Land Development Code shall be known as the "Comprehensive Stormwater Ordinance." It is referred to herein as "this ordinance." 
(Ord. No. O-2009-92, § 2, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 18-732. - Authority. 
    The city is authorized to adopt this ordinance pursuant to North Carolina law, including, but not limited to, Article XIV, Section 5 of the Constitution of North Carolina; Article XXIII of the Wilmington City Charter; G.S. §§ 143-214.7, 160A-174, 160A-175, 160A-185; G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 19; and North Carolina Session Law 2004-163. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-92, § 2, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 18-733. - Findings. 
    It is hereby determined that: 
    Increasing impervious surfaces alters the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increases stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge; 
    These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment; and 
    These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites. 
    Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 ("Clean Water Act") and federal Phase II Stormwater rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission promulgated in response to federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas, including this jurisdiction, to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this ordinance. 
    Therefore, the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-92, § 2, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 18-734. - Purpose. 
(a)  General. The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of construction-related and post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure; safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare; and protect water and aquatic resources. 
(b)  Specific. This ordinance seeks to meet its general purpose through the following specific objectives and means: 
(1)  Establish decision-making processes for development that protect the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Require that new development redevelopment and expansion maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable for the two-year, ten-year, and 25-year design storms to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establish design and review criteria for the construction, function, and use of structural stormwater BMPs that may be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encourage the use of better management and site design practices, such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of green space, riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable; 
(6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no threat to public safety; 
(7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval, and disapproval of stormwater management plans, for the inspection of approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance; 
(8)  Coordinate site design plans that include open space and natural areas with the intent and policies of the comprehensive plan and the Wilmington-New Hanover County CAMA Plan. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-92, § 2, 9-15-09; Ord. No. O-2016-35, § 11, 5-3-16) 
Sec. 18-735. - Applicability and jurisdiction. 
(a)  General. Beginning with and subsequent to its effective date, this ordinance shall be applicable to all development, redevelopment, and expansion including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to this section. 
(b)  Applicability. 
(1)  Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this division shall apply to each of the following: 
a.  Any nonresidential development activity that creates a total of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or more of newly constructed impervious surface area irrespective of the condition of the existing surface upon which the impervious surface area is created. 
b.  All new major subdivisions as defined in article 7 of this chapter. 
c.  Any development activity that requires a sedimentation and erosion control plan. 
d.  Any development activity that requires a Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) major development permit. 
e.  Any single-family residential development within one-half (1/2) mile and draining to class SA waters, that has an impervious surface area greater than twelve (12) percent, and that will add ten thousand (10,000) square feet or more of impervious surface. 
(2)  A development activity or project requires a sedimentation and erosion control plan if the activity or project disturbs one (1) acre or more of land, including an activity or project that disturbs less than one (1) acre of land that is part of a larger common plan of development. 
"Common plan of development" is interpreted as an area where construction activities may be taking place at different times, but under a single over-arching development plan. For example, a residential development project that involves subdivision of land, installation of utilities, access roads and other common facilities with the intention of selling or developing lots in the subdivision as home sites. A stormwater permit is required to cover all activities under the common plan of development including future home sites such that the stormwater system is capable of managing runoff from the entire project at complete build-out. 
(3)  In applying the provisions of this article, the cumulative area of the proposed development activity and all development activity on a site within the two-year period immediately preceding the date of application for a stormwater discharge permit shall be considered together. 
(4)  Whenever an existing developed site is modified to create a total of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or more of newly constructed impervious surface area, irrespective of the condition of the existing surface upon which the new impervious surface is created, the modified portion of the site shall comply with this article. Whenever the modification results in placement of newly constructed impervious surface over any existing surface such that the newly constructed impervious area equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the total impervious surface area, then the entire site shall be required to comply with this article. In determining the applicability of this section, resurfacing of existing pavement without demolition is considered maintenance and not placement of new impervious surface. 
(5)  Any area to be paved, or otherwise made impervious to stormwater exceeding two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet shall require an approved drainage plan in accordance with the city technical standards. Site drainage shall be conveyed through vegetated swales or underground pipes of sufficient size to the nearest storm drain or otherwise as provided in the city's Technical Standards and Design Specifications Manual. 
(c)  Exemptions. The following shall be exempt from the requirements of this division: 
(1)  The installation, repair, replacement or maintenance of subsurface utilities by public or private utility operators; 
(2)  Single-family residential unit that does not meet the applicability standards above; 
(3)  Single-structure duplex residential building (one (1) building with two (2) units not part of a larger common plan or subdivision) unless it meets the threshold for applicability set forth in this section; and 
(4)  Any area to be paved, stabilized, or otherwise made impervious to stormwater that does not exceed two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet. 
(d)  Compliance and permit. No land disturbing activity shall occur except in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance or unless exempted. No development for which a permit is required pursuant to this ordinance shall occur except in compliance with the provisions, conditions, and limitations of the permit. 
(e)  Area of applicability. The provisions of this ordinance shall apply within the corporate limits of the city. The official map of the corporate limits being that along with any written description maintained in the office of the city clerk as required by G.S. § 160A-22.

Sec. 18-736. - Interpretation. 
    In the event of a dispute, the applicability of this ordinance to a particular area of land or BMP shall be determined by reference to the North Carolina General Statutes, the North Carolina Administrative Code, and local zoning and jurisdictional boundary ordinances. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-92, § 2, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 18-737. - Design manual. 
(a)  Reference. The city manager shall use the policy, criteria, and information, including technical specifications and standards, in the Wilmington Technical Standards and Specifications Manual as the basis for decisions about stormwater permits. The New Hanover County-Wilmington Low Impact Development (LID) Guidance Manual and the State of North Carolina Manual of Stormwater Best Management Practices may be used as the basis for design, implementation, performance, and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs. When there is a conflict between these manuals, the more stringent standards shall apply. 
    These manuals include acceptable stormwater treatment practices, including specific design criteria for each stormwater practice. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards of the Phase II laws and regulations. 
(b)  Relationship of design manuals to other laws and regulations. If the specifications or guidelines of the design manuals are more restrictive or apply a higher standard than other laws or regulations, that fact shall not prevent application of the specifications or guidelines in the design manuals. 
(c)  Changes to standards and specifications. If the standards, specifications, guidelines, policies, criteria, or other information in the design manuals are amended subsequent to the submittal of an application for approval pursuant to this ordinance but prior to approval, the design manual in effect at the time of submittal shall control and shall be utilized in reviewing the application and in implementing this ordinance with regard to the application, unless the applicant specifically requests review and permitting under the new policies, provided, however, the applicant submits all documentation required for approval within eighteen (18) months of the date of site plan acceptance in accordance with article 3 of this chapter. A combination of policies (old and new) shall be prohibited. 
(d)  Amendments to design manual. The design manuals may be updated and expanded from time to time, based on advancements in technology and engineering, improved knowledge of local conditions, or local monitoring or maintenance experience. 
    Prior to amending or updating the design manuals, proposed changes shall be generally publicized and made available for review, and an opportunity for comment by interested persons shall be provided, except where annual updates are scheduled or changes are deemed by the city manager to be insignificant.

(Ord. No. O-2009-92, § 2, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 18-747. - Review procedures. 
(a)  Stormwater discharge permit required. A stormwater permit is required for all development, redevelopment, and expansion unless exempt pursuant to this article. A permit may only be issued subsequent to a properly submitted and reviewed permit application, pursuant to this section. For phased developments, each phase shall require a separate, stand-alone stormwater permit application unless the original application included sufficient detail to cover subsequent phases and there are no substantial modifications required. 
    No owner or developer of a site shall commence any of the development activities described in this division above without obtaining a stormwater management permit pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance unless explicitly exempted. 
(1)  Issuance. No stormwater management permit shall be issued until the following conditions are met: 
a.  Approval of a stormwater management plan by the city manager. 
b.  Submission and approval of any required easements and stormwater management inspection and maintenance agreements or other documents as required by this ordinance. All documents required by this ordinance shall be fully executed by applicant prior to the recordation of the final subdivision plat or issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
c.  Payment of stormwater management contribution where off-site stormwater management is applicable. 
d.  Payment of all required application fees. 
e.  Compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations. 
(2)  Transferability. Stormwater management permits shall be issued in the name of the applicant(s) and no permit shall be transferred or assigned without the written consent of the city manager. 
(b)  Existing permit modifications. An existing development proposing to make modifications to an existing permit may be subject to permit revision by NCDWQ or the city according to the following scenarios: 
(1)  For an existing subdivision that has an existing NCDWQ permit with some of the lots not yet developed, the developer of an undeveloped lot would continue to be subject to permitting through NCDWQ. 
(2)  For existing developed parcels with existing NCDWQ permit that are redeveloped the following permitting requirements apply: 
a.  Minor modifications which could mean a change to impervious surface area but no change to the BMP(s) would be processed by NCDWQ. 
b.  Major modifications, which means there is a required change to the BMP(s), would be permitted by the city. NCDWQ will rescind their permit after the new city permit is issued. 
(3)  Permit renewals will be coordinated by the originating permitting agency. 
(c)  Effect of permit. A stormwater management permit shall govern the design, installation, and construction of stormwater management and control practices on the site, including structural BMPs and elements of site design for stormwater management other than structural BMPs. 
    The permit is intended to provide a mechanism for the review, approval, and inspection of the approach to be used for the management and control of stormwater for the development or redevelopment of a site consistent with the requirements of this ordinance, whether the approach consists of structural BMPs or other techniques such as low-impact or low-density design. The permit does not continue in existence indefinitely after the completion of the project; rather, compliance after project construction is assured by the maintenance provisions of this ordinance. 
(d)  Authority to file applications. All applications required pursuant to this Code shall be submitted to the city by the land owner or the land owner's duly authorized agent. A separate application shall be required for each permit, but a permit and application therefore may cover any number of lots being developed as a single project. The application shall be filed with the city on a form approved by the city manager, and signed by the applicant, or by the applicant's agent or representative. 
(e)  Submittal of complete application. An application shall be considered as timely submitted and complete only when it contains all elements of a complete application pursuant to the application submittal schedule and this ordinance, along with the appropriate review fee as set forth in the fee schedule. If the reviewer finds that an application is incomplete, the applicant shall be notified of the deficient elements within fifteen (15) working days from the day of submittal and shall be provided with an opportunity to submit a complete application. If the deficiencies are not corrected by the applicant within fifteen (15) working days from the time of notice of the deficiencies, the application shall be considered withdrawn. However, the submittal of an incomplete application shall not suffice to meet a deadline contained in any submission schedule established for the review of applications. To be complete, an application shall include the appropriate fee as set forth in the fee schedule. 
    A complete application shall not be construed as an approved application nor shall it indicate that additional information will not be required for submission as part of the review process. 
(f)  Review. The city manager shall review the application and determine whether the application complies with the standards of this ordinance. For a project of one hundred (100) acres or less, the city manager shall complete the review within sixty (60) calendar days after an application is deemed complete. 
(1)  Approval. The city manager shall approve the application if the application complies with the standards of this ordinance. The city manager may impose conditions of approval as needed to ensure compliance with this ordinance. The conditions shall be included as part of the approval. 
(2)  Conditions of approval. All stormwater management permits are conditioned on compliance with the approved plan and with all relevant laws, ordinances, regulations, and standards of any state or local government or agency, including any standards established by the city relating to stormwater management. Permits are also conditioned on the agreement and obligation of the applicant to save harmless the city, its officers and employees, from any expense incurred through the failure of the applicant, or the applicant's agents to complete any required stormwater management measures, or from any damages growing out of the negligence of the applicant or the applicant's agents in connection with stormwater management measures. 
(3)  Failure to comply. The city manager shall notify the applicant if the application fails to comply with the standards of this ordinance, and shall indicate how the application fails to comply. The applicant shall have an opportunity to submit an application with revisions. (This shall be known as a resubmittal.) 
(4)  Resubmittal. If a revised application is not resubmitted within sixty (60) calendar days from the date the applicant was notified, the application shall be considered withdrawn, and a new submittal for the same or substantially the same project shall be required along with the appropriate fee for a new submittal. 
A complete revised application shall be reviewed by the city manager within sixty (60) calendar days after its timely resubmittal and shall be approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved. 
One (1) timely resubmittal of an application may be submitted without payment of an additional permit review fee. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-92, § 2, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 18-748. - Concept plan. 
    Before a stormwater management permit application is submitted, a stormwater concept plan shall accompany the TRC application. For projects not requiring TRC review, the applicant may schedule a pre-application conference. The purpose of this review is to discuss the post-construction stormwater management measures necessary for the proposed project, as well as to discuss and assess constraints, opportunities and potential approaches to stormwater management designs before formal site design engineering is commenced. Any relevant local watershed plans, the comprehensive plan, the CAMA plan, and other relevant resource protection plans should be consulted in the discussion of the concept plan. 
    To accomplish this goal, the following minimum information shall be included in the concept plan, which shall also be submitted as part of the application: 
(a)  Existing conditions and proposed site plan. Existing conditions and proposed site layout sketch plans, which illustrate at a minimum: existing and proposed topography; existence of any streams or other surface waters; mapping of predominant soils from soil surveys; boundaries of existing predominant vegetation; proposed limits of clearing and grading; and location of existing and proposed roads, buildings, parking areas and other impervious surfaces. 
(b)  Natural resources inventory. The applicant shall submit a written or graphic inventory of natural resources at the site and surrounding area as it exists prior to the commencement of the project based on available site data and available GIS information. This description should include a discussion of soil types, forest cover, significant geologic features, topography, wetlands, and native vegetative areas on the site, as well as the location and boundaries of other natural feature protection and conservation areas such as lakes, ponds, floodplains, stream buffers and other setbacks (e.g., drinking water well setbacks, septic setbacks, etc.). Particular attention should be paid to environmentally sensitive features that provide particular opportunities or constraints for development and stormwater management. This information can be incorporated into the site inventory as required in article 3. 
(c)  Stormwater management system concept plan. A written or graphic concept plan of the proposed post-development stormwater management system including: preliminary selection and location of proposed structural stormwater controls; low-impact design elements; preliminary sizing, location of existing and proposed conveyance systems such as grass channels, swales, and storm drains; flow paths; location of floodplain/floodway limits; relationship of site to upstream and downstream properties and drainages; and preliminary location of any proposed stream channel modifications, such as bridge or culvert crossings.

Sec. 18-749. - Off-site stormwater management requirement. 
    Where a development is within the drainage of a public stormwater management facility or other improvements to the city's drainage system that have been constructed, programmed, or identified for construction in the city's capital improvement program or are reflected on the city's master drainage improvement plan, which have or will have sufficient capacity to accommodate flood attenuation requirements for run-off generated by the development, the city may require the applicant to pay to the city a fee in lieu of construction of on-site stormwater management facilities in accordance with the following formula except in the CBD or RFMU districts where fee in lieu does not apply: 
Fee = [(0.12) (Land value) + (Construction cost) (Site Acreage)] (% impervious) 
    For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: 
(a)  Land value shall be the most recently assessed tax value for the tract of land being developed or the most recent purchase price, whichever is the greatest. 
(b)  Construction cost shall mean the dollar amount per acre of constructing on-site stormwater management facilities based on historical data. On the date of this ordinance, such amount shall be five thousand forty-seven dollars ($5,047.00). Such amount shall be adjusted annually on July 1, based on the construction cost index for the prior year. 
(c)  Site acreage shall be the total area of the tract of land being developed and requiring stormwater management facilities in acres, rounded to the nearest one-tenth ( 1/10 ) of an acre. If partial control of runoff is controlled on site, the acreage will be adjusted on a pro rata basis. 
(d)  Percent impervious shall be the acreage on the site requiring stormwater management facilities that is impenetrable by water divided by the total site acreage, rounded to the nearest tenth of an acre. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-92, § 2, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 18-750. - Stormwater management measures within the NC State Ports area and the CBD and RFMU districts. 
    In the NC State Ports area and the CBD and RFMU districts, stormwater management plans must include on-site measures that meet the performance standards of this section. 
(a)  The following water quality performance standards must be met with use of approved best management practices (BMPs): 
(1)  The project shall control and treat the run-off from the first one and one-half (11/2) inches of rain; or 
(2)  The project shall control and treat the difference in stormwater run-off between the pre-development and post-development conditions for the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm, whichever is greater. 
(b)  The following is a list of BMPs deemed approved if designed and constructed according to the Technical Standards and Specifications Manual, the NC DENR BMP Manual or the New Hanover County-Wilmington LID Guidance Manual, whichever is more stringent: 
(1)  Vegetative roof cover. 
(2)  Permeable pavement. 
(3)  Infiltration devices. 
(4)  Bioretention devices. 
(5)  Other devices in the city Technical Standards and Specifications Manual, NC [DENR] BMP Manual, and New Hanover County-Wilmington LID Guidance Manual. 
(c)  The following BMPs may be considered on a case-by-case basis as approved by the city manager: 
(1)  Proprietary devices with design flow rates that have been approved for use by the city engineer on a case-by-case basis to meet water quality standards; and 
(2)  Cisterns with demonstrated capacity and use-assurance to meet requirements. 
(d)  Redevelopment projects exempt. Redevelopment projects in the NC State Port area and the CBD and RFMU districts that meet all of the following criteria are exempt from the provisions of this section: 
(1)  The redevelopment creates no net increase in total site impervious surface area over existing site conditions; 
(2)  The proposed redevelopment provides stormwater controls that are equal or better than the previous development; and 
(3)  A site plan application for the redevelopment project has been accepted as complete within twelve (12) months of the issuance of any demolition permit for existing structures on the site and an approved site plan is received within twelve (12) months. The city manager may grant an extension of ninety (90) days to receive an approved permit if substantial progress has been made. If a site plan is substantially changed subsequent to the expiration of twelve (12) months from demolition permit issuance, the site plan will be reviewed as a new development application. 
(e)  Redevelopment projects in the CBD and RFMU districts that are part of a larger common plan of development that has previously been permitted as meeting the criteria above for redevelopment shall also be exempt from the provisions of this section. 
(f)  Other considerations. This section does not apply to projects for which a stormwater permit has been issued prior to the adoption of this ordinance (September 15, 2009). No waivers shall be made retroactive to the effective date of this section. No refunds shall be considered for fees assessed prior to the effective date of this section.

Sec. 18-751. - Additional requirements for fee alternative. 
    Fees approved and accepted by the city for off-site stormwater management shall be used by the city for land acquisition (including easements and rights-of-way) and the study, engineering, design, purchase, construction, expansion, repair, maintenance, landscaping, and inspection of public stormwater management facilities, either existing or contained in an approved capital improvements program or reflected on the city's master drainage improvement plan. Fees collected from the development shall be applied to projects benefiting in the drainage basin from which the fee is collected. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-92, § 2, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 18-752. - As-built plans and final approval. 
    Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted, the applicant shall certify that the completed project is in accordance with the approved stormwater management plans and designs, and shall submit actual "as-built" plans for all stormwater management facilities or practices after final construction is completed. 
    The plans shall show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and practices and the field location, type, size, depth, invert and planted vegetation of all measures, controls, and devices, as installed. As-built plans shall be prepared in accordance with the city technical standards. As-built stormwater measures, controls, and devices shall be certified, under seal, to be in compliance with the approved stormwater management plans and designs and with the requirements of this ordinance. A final inspection and approval by the city manager shall occur before the release of any performance securities. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-92, § 2, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 18-753. - Other permits. 
    No certificate of compliance or occupancy shall be issued by the city without final as-built plans and a final inspection and approval by the city manager, except where multiple units are served by the stormwater practice or facilities, in which case the city may elect to withhold a percentage of permits or certificates of occupancy until as-built plans are submitted and final inspection and approval has occurred. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-92, § 2, 9-15-09) 
Sec. 18-754. - Approvals. 
(a)  Effect of approval. Approval authorizes the applicant to go forward with only the specific plans and activities authorized in the permit. The approval shall not be construed to exempt the applicant from obtaining other applicable approvals from local, state, and federal authorities. 
(b)  Time limit/expiration. An approved plan shall become invalid if the applicant fails to make substantial progress on the site within eighteen (18) months after the date of approval. The city manager may grant a single, six-month extension of this time limit, for good cause shown, upon receiving a written request from the applicant before the expiration of the approved plan. In granting an extension, the city manager may require compliance with standards adopted since the original application was submitted unless there has been substantial reliance on the original permit and the change in standards would infringe the applicant's vested rights. 
(c)  Renewal. If the stormwater management permit expires, the permittee shall make application for a new permit in accordance with this ordinance.

PART 3. - STANDARDS 

Sec. 18-760. - General standards. 
    All development, redevelopment, or expansion to which this ordinance applies shall comply with the standards of this section. 
(a)  Design storm. The city has determined regardless of density classification or location the minimum control for safety of life and property to be the control of the post-development peak discharge rate of the two-year, ten-year, and 25-year storms to not exceed the predevelopment peak runoff discharge rate for the same storms. Privately owned and maintained on-site conveyance systems shall be designed at a minimum to convey the ten-year storm provided the standard for the post development peak discharge rate as specified in this section is met. 
(b)  Overland flow. Design engineers shall indicate on the project drainage plans, the location and approximate extent of the overland relief path and areas that may be affected by surface storage for the appropriate design storm. 
(c)  [Redevelopment projects that meet the criteria.] For redevelopment projects that meet the criteria laid out below, the project at a minimum shall treat the water quality volume specified in this section. 
(1)  The redevelopment creates no net increase in total site impervious surface area over existing site conditions; 
(2)  The proposed redevelopment provides stormwater controls that are equal or better than the previous development; and 
(3)  A site plan application for the redevelopment project has been accepted as complete within twelve (12) months of the issuance of any demolition permit for existing structures on the site and an approved site plan is received within twelve (12) months. The city manager may grant an extension of ninety (90) days to receive an approved permit if substantial progress has been made. If a site plan is substantially changed subsequent to the expiration of twelve (12) months from demolition permit issuance, the site plan will be reviewed as a new development application. A project that is part of a larger common plan of development that has previously been permitted as meeting the criteria above for redevelopment shall also be deemed to meet these criteria. 
(d)  Buffers from surface waters. New development shall have a fifty-foot wide vegetative buffer and redevelopment activities shall have a thirty-foot wide vegetative buffer along all perennial or intermittent surface waters. A perennial or intermittent surface water shall be deemed present if the feature is approximately shown on either the most recent version of the soil survey map prepared by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the most recent version of the 1:24,000 scale (7.5 minute) quadrangle topographic maps prepared by the United States Geologic Survey (USGS). The width of a buffer is measured horizontally from the normal pool elevation of impounded structures, from the bank of each side of streams or rivers, and from the mean high waterline of tidal waters, perpendicular to the shoreline. The vegetative buffer may be cleared or graded, but must be planted with and maintained in grass or any other vegetative or plant material and may contain vegetated BMPs that otherwise meet the requirements of this article and the design manual. Vegetative buffers and filters required by this section and any other buffers or filters required by state water quality or coastal management rules or local government requirements may be met concurrently and may contain, in whole or in part, coastal, isolated, or 404 jurisdictional wetlands that are located landward of the normal waterline. 
(e)  Built-upon area setbacks. All built-upon area shall be landward of any buffer required under this section from any perennial and intermittent surface waters as defined herein. 
(f)  [Relief from the buffer and setbacks required.] Relief from the buffer and setbacks required in this section may be granted when the applicant can provide an official letter of determination by the North Carolina Division of Water Quality that surface waters are not present in accordance with 15A NCAC 02B .0233(3)(a). 
(g)  [Development of boating facilities or other water dependent uses.] Development of boating facilities or other water dependent uses that have received or are required to secure a Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) major permit are exempt from the vegetative buffer requirements to the extent allowed by the permit. 
(h)  [Urban waterfront development or redevelopment.] The development or redevelopment of a parcel in the Urban Waterfront as defined by North Carolina Administrative Code 15 NCAC 07H .0209(g) is exempt from the buffer and setback requirements of this section provided that it meets the following conditions: 
(1)  The development must be consistent with adopted plans; 
(2)  Impervious surfaces shall not exceed thirty (30) percent of the AEC area of the lot. Impervious surfaces may exceed thirty (30) percent if the applicant can effectively demonstrate, through a stormwater management system design, that the protection provided by the design would be equal to or exceed the protection by the thirty (30) percent limitation. Redevelopment of areas exceeding the thirty (30) percent impervious surface limitation may be permitted if impervious areas are not increased and the applicant designs the project to comply with the intent of the rule to the maximum extent feasible; and 
(3)  The development shall meet all stormwater management requirements of this section. 
(i)  Covenant restrictions. The approval of the stormwater management permit shall require an enforceable restriction on property that runs with the land, such as a recorded deed restriction or protective covenants, to ensure that future development, management, redevelopment, or expansion maintains the site consistent with the approved project plans, including recordation on any approved plat limits of impervious surface area on a per-lot basis, if applicable. 
(j)  [Multiple lot developments.] Multiple lot developments shall be regulated through deed restrictions on the allocation of impervious surface area on a per-lot basis as identified on approved plans and preliminary plans. For exempt subdivisions, impervious limits may be required on a final plat to correspond to an approved drainage plan or stormwater plan if applicable. Per lot allocations for residential developments shall include a primary allocation for primary residences including attached garages and driveways and a secondary allocation for accessory structures with impervious surfaces.

Sec. 18-761. - Other considerations in design preparation. 
(a)  The predevelopment peak discharge rate shall be computed assuming that all land uses in the drainage area of the proposed facility are in a predevelopment state. The city considers predevelopment state to be woods in good condition for the purposes of determining runoff coefficients. 
(b)  The developer shall incorporate use of natural topography and land cover such as wetlands, ponds, natural swales, and depressions as they exist prior to development to the degree that they can accommodate the additional flow of water. 
(c)  Where storm drainage systems convey off-site stormwater through the property, computations reflecting the drainage area of land tributary to the site, and estimated runoff of the area served by such systems, shall be provided. In addition, a complete drainage study shall be submitted for the site. All storm drainage systems conveying off-site stormwater through property shall be public systems or private systems which shall be designed, constructed and maintained to at least the standards of a public storm drainage system as contained in the standards and specifications manual. The design and construction shall be certified by an authorized registered professional as meeting or exceeding the requirements of this division and the stormwater management technical standards and specifications.

Sec. 18-762. - Development standards near outstanding resource waters. 
    Development activities within five hundred seventy-five (575) feet of the mean high waterline of areas designated by the environmental management commission ("commission") as outstanding resource waters (ORW) shall be permitted as follows: 
(a)  Low-density projects. Development shall comply with all of the following standards in addition to the general standards in section 18-760 in order to be considered low-density: 
(1)  The development has an impervious surface area of twelve (12) percent or less.

Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or building site to be served by a structural BMP pursuant to this ordinance, and prior to issuance of any permit for development or redevelopment requiring a structural BMP pursuant to this ordinance, the applicant or owner of the site must execute an operation and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of the site, portions of the site, and lots or parcels served by the structural BMP. Until the transference of all property, sites, or lots served by the structural BMP, the original owner or applicant shall have primary responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the maintenance agreements. 
    The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner or owners to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the structural BMP, and shall state the terms, conditions, and schedule of maintenance for the structural BMP. In addition, it shall grant to the city a right of entry in the event that the city manager, or his designee, has reason to believe it has become necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the structural BMP; however, in no case shall the right of entry, of itself, confer an obligation on the city to assume responsibility for the structural BMP. 
    The operation and maintenance agreement must be approved by the city prior to plan approval, and it shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with the county register of deeds upon final plat approval. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall be given to the city manager within fourteen (14) days following its recordation. 
    Conveyance of the property shall not terminate the original developer's obligations under this article until such time as a replacement permit is approved by the city manager. The original developer shall include in the deed conveying the property notice of the existence of the stormwater control measures and the purchaser's obligations to maintain and inspect them and to obtain a permit and otherwise comply with the terms of this article. 
(b)  Special requirement for homeowner and other associations. For all structural BMPs required pursuant to this ordinance and that are to be or are owned and maintained by a homeowner association, property owner association, or similar entity, the required operation and maintenance agreement shall include all of the following provisions: 
(1)  Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously operate and maintain the stormwater control and management facilities.
