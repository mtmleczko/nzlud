PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Greensboro, North Carolina of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1961 Code, as supplemented through March 16, 1987, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1961 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the second section of Chapter 1 is 1-2. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 1-1 and 1-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 1-1.1, 1-1.2 and 1-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 2 and 3, it will be designated as Chapter 2.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Jesse L. Warren, City Attorney and his staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

As soon as he has completed his certificate, the clerk shall notify the committee of petitioners of the contents of the certificate. If a petition is certified sufficient, the clerk shall present his certificate to the City Council at its next meeting and that certificate shall be a final determination as to the sufficiency of the petition. If a petition certified sufficient is a recall petition, the clerk shall also give written notice of the action taken to the Council member whose removal is sought. If a petition is certified insufficient under Section 2.73(d)(1), a majority of the committee of petitioners may elect to amend the petition; but if a majority does not so elect to amend the petition, the clerk shall present his certificate to the council at its next meeting and that certificate shall be a final determination as to the sufficiency of the petition. 
(b)  If a majority of the committee of petitioners elects to amend the petition, then within ten days after notice of the contents of the clerks' [clerk's] certificate, the committee may file, for purposes of amendment, a supplementary petition upon additional papers. The supplementary petition shall be governed by the same requirements as an original petition with respect to such matters as uniformity and assembly of papers, listing of the petitioners' committee, text or designation and description of measures, circulators' affidavits, the writing and counting but not the number of signatures; and the clerk shall proceed as in the case of an original petition. Within two days after receipt of a supplementary petition complying with the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of Section 2.73, the clerk shall deliver the supplementary petition papers to the county board of elections for a checking of the marked signatures against the registration books. The Board of Elections shall complete its check within five days after receipt of the said petition papers; except that the said board shall not be obligated to conduct a check in any 30-day period immediately preceding, or in any 10-day period immediately following a county-wide or city-wide election. Upon completion of this check, the Board of Elections shall forthwith certify to the city clerk the number of voters registered in the city or in the municipal electoral district, if applicable, whose signatures, marked by the clerk, appear on the supplementary petition papers that the board found it necessary to examine. If it was found necessary to check all names on the supplementary papers, this fact shall be indicated in the certificate. The supplementary petition papers shall be returned to the city clerk by the Board of Elections together with the certificate. 
(c)  Within two days after the return of the supplementary petition papers by the Board of Elections, the clerk shall complete a second certificate as to whether the original petition, as amended by the supplementary petition is sufficient. If the clerk certifies the amended petition insufficient, his second certificate shall show the particulars wherein the petition is still defective. As soon as he has completed his second certificate, the clerk shall notify the petitioners' committee of its contents and shall present that certificate to the Council at its next meeting, and that certificate shall be a final determination as to the sufficiency of the petition. 
(d)  If a petition has been certified insufficient and there is no election to amend it, or if an amended petition is certified insufficient, the clerk shall present his latest certificate on the petition to the Council at its next meeting. 
(e)  If, in any one of the ways provided in this Section, a final determination has been made that a petition is insufficient, that determination shall be subject to judicial review, but no further action shall be taken on the petition unless the reviewing court directs otherwise. Such a final determination, even if sustained upon review, shall not prejudice the filing of a new petition for the same purposes.

(b)  If the Council fails to adopt, or adopts with amendment, a proposed initiative ordinance, or if the Council fails to repeal an ordinance reconsidered pursuant to a referendum petition, it shall submit the originally proposed initiative ordinance or refer the reconsidered ordinance concerned to the voters of the city. 
(c)  When the Council has been presented with, or has, a recall petition which has been finally determined sufficient in accordance with the preceding Sections of this subchapter, it shall thereupon fix a day for holding a recall election unless, prior to Council consideration of the matter, the Council member whose removal is sought has resigned and his resignation has been accepted by the Council. Any recall election for a council member from an electoral district shall be held within that district only. 
(d)  An initiative election shall be held at the next regularly scheduled primary or general election in Guilford County for state, county or municipal officials following ninety (90) days after the petition has been finally determined to be sufficient.

Below the instruction shall appear, in the order indicated, the following propositions: "FOR THE RECALL OF (NAME OF OFFICER)" and "AGAINST THE RECALL OF (NAME OF OFFICER)." Immediately at the left of each of the two propositions thus set out, there shall be a square in which by making a cross (x) the voter may cast his vote. 
(c)  If voting machines are used for an initiative, referendum or recall election, the ballot title shall have below it the same two propositions appropriate to its nature as prescribed for the paper ballot, one above the other or one preceding the other in the order indicated, and the voter shall have an opportunity to vote in favor of either of the two propositions and thereby to vote his preference. 
(d)  Any number of initiative, referendum or recall proposals may be voted on at the same election and may appear on the same ballot. Paper ballots used for voting on one or more such proposals shall be used for that purpose only. If more than one proposal appears on the same paper ballot or if voted on by paper ballot at the same election, each one shall be presented for voting with ballot title, instruction, propositions, and voting squares as prescribed for single proposals. If voting machines are used, each proposal shall be presented for voting as prescribed for single proposals on voting machines.

(2)  But not later than the fifteenth day immediately preceding the day scheduled for a vote in the city on the proposal concerned. 
(b)  No petition shall be withdrawn except by written request for its withdrawal filed with the Council within the time limits prescribed for withdrawal and signed by at least four of the five members of the petitioners' committee for that petition. The filing of such request immediately withdraws the petition and there shall be no further action on or under that petition and no city vote or further action pursuant to that petition on the proposal concerned. 
Sec. 2.79. - Results of election. 
(a)  If a majority of the voters of the city voting upon a proposed initiative ordinance shall vote in favor of it, the ordinance involved shall thereupon be an ordinance of the city. A referred ordinance not approved by a majority of the voters voting on it shall thereupon be repealed. 
(b)  If a majority of the votes cast on the question of recalling a Council member be against his recall he shall continue in office for the remainder of the unexpired term, but subject to recall as before. If a majority of such votes be for the recall of the Council member designated on the ballot, he shall be removed from office. 
(c)  If a Council member in regard to whom a sufficient recall petition is submitted to the Council shall resign before the election and his resignation be accepted by the Council, or shall be removed as a result thereof, the vacancy shall be filled in the manner provided by this charter for filling vacancies in such office, except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this Section. But a Council member removed by the voters as the result of a recall election, or resigning after a sufficient petition for his recall has been submitted to the Council shall not be re-elected to fill the vacancy caused by his own removal or resignation. 
(d)  If the recall of a majority of the members of the City Council, including the mayor as one of the members, shall be effected at a single recall election, the successors of the Council members recalled shall be elected by the registered, qualified voters of the city at a special municipal election, and said successors shall serve for the unexpired part of the term of the Council members recalled. The members of the City Council who have not been recalled are empowered to call such special election and to make all necessary provisions regarding the same in conformity with the Constitution and general laws of North Carolina.

When in the opinion of the City Council, or the mayor, city manager and treasurer, acting jointly, it is determined that the cash in any funds is in excess of the amount required to meet current needs, the Council, or the mayor, manager and treasurer, acting jointly, may deposit excess funds at interest with an official depository in the city upon terms authorized by applicable laws of the United States and the State of North Carolina, or invest in shares of any building and loan association organized and licensed under the laws of the State of North Carolina, or in shares of any federal savings and loan association organized under the laws of the United States and having its principal office in this State; or invest excess funds in bonds or certificates of indebtedness or treasury bills of the United States of America, or in bonds, notes or other obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the United States of America when the payment of principal and interest thereon is fully guaranteed by the United States of America, or in bonds of the City of Greensboro, North Carolina, or in certificates of deposit issued by banks or official depositories within the City of Greensboro, North Carolina.

(b)  The funds shall be so invested that, in the judgment of the Council, or of the mayor, manager and treasurer, acting jointly, they may be readily converted into money as needed. Earnings from the investment of proceeds of sale of bonds may be applied to the payment of the interest or principal of the bonds from the sale of which the proceeds where derived, or may be applied as increment to the proceeds. Earnings received on deposits and the income from investments, other than the investment of the proceeds from the sale of bonds, unless otherwise required by law, shall be paid into the city's general fund.

When an appeal is from a decision of the building inspector refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed.

ARTICLE 6. - ROADS AND STREETS 

Sec. 6.51. - Establishment of proposed street lines. 
    Whenever, in the opinion of the City Council, it is for the best interest of the city that any street should be widened or extended, or both, or that a new street should be opened, the Council may pass an ordinance declaring that such street should be widened or extended, or both, or that such new street should be opened, and shall lay out in the ordinance the lines within which such street should be widened, extended, or opened. If any street under the provision of such ordinance is to be widened, it need not be widened on both sides; and, if it is to be widened on both sides, the distance to be widened on both sides need not be the same. Any ordinance introduced for the purpose of widening, extending, or opening any street under the provisions of this charter, may not be adopted until the proposed ordinance is published in a newspaper published in the city and qualified to carry legal notices at least two times, on separate days at least ten days before the passage of the ordinance, or, if there be no such newspaper, posted in three public places in the city. There shall be posted or published with the ordinance a notice stating when property owners may be heard by the Council. A public hearing on the question of the adoption of such ordinance shall be held prior to the passage of the ordinance. 
Sec. 6.52. - Notice to city required before improvement. 
    After the passage of such ordinance, it shall be unlawful for any land within the proposed street lines established by such ordinance to be built upon or improved, or for any part of any existing building within said lines to be repaired or otherwise improved until the city shall have first been given an opportunity to purchase or otherwise acquire said property for street purposes as provided in this charter. To that end, any person proposing to build upon such land or to make repairs or improvements to that part of any existing building situated thereon shall, in writing, notify the City Council of the nature and estimated cost of such building, repairs, or improvements. The Council shall then determine whether it will take the necessary steps to acquire said land prior to the construction of said building or the making of such repairs or improvements, and if it fails within sixty days from date of receipt of said notice to acquire, or to institute condemnation proceedings to acquire, said property, the owner or other person giving such notice may proceed to erect the building in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the city, or to make the repairs or improvements described in said notice. 
Sec. 6.53. - Failure to give notice bars recovery. 
    If any person, firm, or corporation builds upon any land included within proposed street lines, or repairs or otherwise improves that part of any existing building within proposed street lines without giving the city an opportunity to acquire said land free from said improvements, as provided in the preceding Section, the city shall not be required to pay for the value of the building, repairs, or improvements in any proceeding subsequently brought to acquire said land for the purpose set out in said Section. 
Sec. 6.54. - Acquisition of land. 
    If upon receiving any notice in compliance with Section 6.52, the City Council determines to acquire said land immediately, it may acquire the same by grant, purchase, or condemnation. In no case shall an effort to purchase said land be necessary to the institution of condemnation proceedings. If the Council determines to proceed by condemnation, the condemnation shall be as set forth in this charter. 
Sec. 6.55. - Cost of land acquired for street widening to be assessed as part of improvement. 
    After any land has been purchased or condemned for the purpose of widening, extending, or opening any street, and the land purchased or condemned lies within the limits of an improvement directed in said proceeding, then the amount paid by the city for the land purchased or condemned, together with the cost of the condemnation proceeding and interest on said amount paid and costs at the rate of six per cent per annum from the date of payment, shall be included in the cost of said improvement and shall be assessed as provided by law against the property to be assessed for the improvements. 
Sec. 6.56. - Exercise of condemnation power after failure to condemn following notice. 
    The failure of the city to acquire any land within sixty days after receiving notice that the same is to be built upon, or that a building thereon is to be repaired or otherwise improved, or its failure within said time to institute proceedings to condemn the same shall not limit the right of the city at any subsequent time to condemn the same; but in such case the owner shall be entitled to compensation as now provided by law for the building, repairs, or improvements made after the giving of the required notice and the failure of the city to acquire said land free of said improvements. 
(S.L. 1961, Ch. 686, § 16) 
Sec. 6.61. - Power to close streets. 
(a)  The city council shall have the power to close any street or portion thereof that is now or may hereafter be opened or dedicated, either by the recording of a subdivision plat or otherwise. In addition, upon receipt of a sufficient petition signed by the owners of a majority of the property abutting a street, requesting that it be closed, and after an investigation of the sufficiency of the petition by the city attorney, the city clerk shall publish a notice of a public hearing to be held by the council, such publication to be once a week for two (2) successive weeks in a newspaper published in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices; the notice shall be published the first time not less than ten (10) days nor more than twenty-five (25) days before the date fixed for the hearing. Any individuals owning property abutting a street who do not join in the request for closing the street shall be notified by registered letter of the time and place of the public hearing. If it appears to the satisfaction of the city council that the closing of the street is not contrary to the public interest, and that no individual owning property in the vicinity of the street or in the subdivision in which it is located will thereby be deprived of reasonable means of ingress or egress to his property, the city council may order the closing of the street; provided, that any person aggrieved may appeal within thirty (30) days from the order of the council to the Superior Court of Guilford County, where the question shall be heard de novo. Upon such an appeal, the superior court shall have full jurisdiction to decide the matter upon the issues arising and to order the street closed upon proper finding of fact by a jury. A certified copy of the order of the council (or the judgment of the superior court in the event of an appeal) shall be filed in the office of the Register of Deeds of Guilford County. Upon the closing of a street in accordance with the provisions of this section, all right, title, and interest in the portion of the street closed shall be conclusively presumed to be vested in the owners of the lots or parcels of land abutting the portion of the street closed, and the title of each of such owners shall, for the width of the abutting land owned by such persons, extend to the center of the street. Copies of all registered letters giving the notice required by this section, and the return receipts or other good and sufficient evidence of the giving of the required notice shall be filed in the office of the city clerk together with the resolution ordering said closing; provided, a certified copy of the resolution of the council ordering the closing of the street or streets shall be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds of Guilford County. No final action shall be taken by the city council to close a street until the matter has been referred to the Greensboro Planning Board for study and recommendations, but no public hearing shall be necessary before the Greensboro Planning Board. 
(b)  The resolution ordering the closing of a street may provide for utility rights-of-way to be retained by the city or public utility company, if needed. 
(c)  The provisions contained herein shall not be construed to limit the authority of the city under this charter or under general law to sell, exchange, convey, or otherwise dispose of any fee interest which it may have acquired in any street.

(2)  Concerning collection of charges for utility services and for the use of utility facilities. If pursuant to any rule or regulation utility service to any property is discontinued, it shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation without the City Manager's approval to renew a utility service or to use it without having first paid any outstanding charges and obtained the approval of the City Manager. Violations of this paragraph shall be misdemeanors punishable by a fine of not exceeding fifty dollars ($50.00), or imprisonment for not exceeding thirty days. 
(c)  As used in this charter, unless the context otherwise requires, the term "utility" includes water supply, water distribution, sewerage, waste disposal, electric power, gas, and public transportation utilities.

    The City Council may require that within thirty days after a water main or sewer main is completed and made ready for use, the owner of every abutting lot whereon water is supplied for any human use shall cause the lot to be connected to the water main or sewer main. 
Sec. 6.83. - Liens for utility charges. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, when any charge for utility service or for the use of utility facilities is not paid within ten days after it becomes due, the same shall become a lien upon the property served or in connection with which the service or facility is used. The charge may at any time thereafter be collected, either by suit in the name of the city or by the city tax collector for the city, by the sale of the property upon which the lien attaches at the Guilford County courthouse door, after advertising the sale once a week for four successive weeks in some newspaper published in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices. The sale shall be made under the same rules and regulations, and subject to the same costs and penalties and to the same rights of redemption as are provided by law for the foreclosure of the lien on real estate for taxes. 
(b)  When any charge for utility service or for the use of utility facilities is for a rental property and the tenants of the rental property are individually liable for the charge, the city shall collect any charge that is incurred and becomes past-due after July 1, 2010, pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 160A-314 and any other applicable general or local law. The city shall not collect any charge from a tenant that is incurred and becomes past-due after July 1, 2010, under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. 
(S.B. 177, 6-15-2011) 
Sec. 6.84. - Deposits by tenants; final disposition of deposits. 
    In addition to other remedies now provided for the collection of any charge for utility service or the use of utility facilities and as a part of the cost of such utility service, a deposit by a tenant of the premises to be served may be required. The deposits may vary according to the type of service. The utility service charge, if not paid within the time designated, may be deducted from the deposit and utility service may be cut off and not be turned on again until the balance of the deposit is increased to the original amount thereof. In order that the utility of the city may be protected and that the costs of services shall be paid by the person receiving such services, a tenant may give notice that the premises have been or will be vacated and that the utility should be cut off, and, in the event that all charges due are paid he shall be entitled to the return of his deposit. In the event the tenant shall vacate the premises without notifying the city and having the utility cut off, he shall forfeit to the city any balance of such deposit remaining after the utility service charge due has been deducted. Such forfeited money may be used by the city for the payment of principal or interest on the bonded indebtedness of the city incurred for the utility involved or the money may be used for the maintenance or extension of the utility service involved.

(S.L. 1961, Ch. 686, §§ 18, 19) 
Sec. 6.139. - Notice of hearing. 
(a)  Upon the presentation of a sufficient petition for local improvements, or when it is proposed to make without petition any improvements authorized to be made without petition, a notice shall be prepared by the city attorney which shall contain substantially the following:

(S.L. 1986, Ch. 807, § 6) 
Sec. 6.140. - Public hearing. 
    At the time for the public hearing, or at some subsequent time to which such hearing shall be adjourned, the council shall consider objections to the legality of the improvements made in compliance with paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of the preceding section, together with objections to the policy or expediency of the making of the improvements, and the council shall thereafter determine whether it will order the making of the improvements. Any objections to the legality of the making of the improvements not made in writing, signed in person or by attorney, and filed with the city clerk at or before the time or adjourned time of the hearing shall be considered as waived; and if any such objection shall be made and shall not be sustained by the council, the adoption of the resolution ordering the making of the improvements shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented, unless within ten days after the adoption of the resolution proper steps shall be taken in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief. 
Sec. 6.141. - Resolution ordering improvements; publication. 
(a)  After the public hearing, if the council determines to make the improvements proposed, it shall adopt a resolution which shall contain: 
(1)  If the improvements are to be made by petition, a finding by the council as to the sufficiency of the petition, which finding shall be final and conclusive. 
(2)  If the improvements are to be made without petition, a finding by the council of such facts as are required in order to authorize improvements without petition. 
(3)  A general description of the improvements to be made and the designation of the street or streets or parts thereof where the work is to be done. 
(4)  If the improvement directed to be made is the paving of a roadway or part thereof wherein a railroad company has tracks, a direction that said company pave that part of the street occupied by its tracks, the rails of the tracks, and eighteen (18) inches in width outside such tracks, with such material and in such manner as the governing body may prescribe, and that unless such paving be completed on or before a day specified in the resolution, the governing body will cause the same to be done. Where such railroad company shall occupy such street or streets under a franchise or contract which otherwise provided, such franchise or contract shall not be affected by this Section, except insofar as may be consistent with the provisions of such franchise or contract. 
(5)  If the improvement directed to be made includes the construction of water mains or sewers, and in order to provide the mains or sewers in the street or streets to be improved it is necessary to extend them beyond the limits of the street or streets, the resolution shall contain a provision for the necessary extension of such mains or sewers and a further provision that the cost of such extension shall eventually be assessed against the lots or parcels of land abutting the street or streets in which such extensions are made but that assessments shall not be made until such time as the Council shall thereafter determine by appropriate resolution. 
(6)  If the improvement directed to be made is the paving of a roadway or part thereof, or the construction of sidewalks, the resolution may, but need not, contain a direction that the owner of each lot abutting the part of the street to be improved, connect his lot by means of laterals with water mains, gas or sewer pipes, or any one or more thereof, located in the street adjacent to his premises in accordance with the requirements governing the laying of laterals, and that unless the owners cause laterals to be laid on or before a date specified in the resolution, the date to be not less than thirty day[s] after the date of the resolution, the Council will cause the same to be laid. 
(7)  A designation of the proportion of the cost of the improvements to be assessed against abutting property, and of the number of equal annual installments in which assessments may be paid. 
(b)  The resolution after its passage shall be published at least once in some newspaper published in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices, or, if there be no such newspaper, the resolution shall be posted in three public places in the city for at least five days; except, that in any case where the Council directed that the notice should be served or mailed instead of being published, the resolution ordering the improvements need not be either published or posted. 
Sec. 6.142. - Details of construction; contracts for construction. 
    The Council shall have power to determine the character and type of construction and of material to be used and to determine any other details of plan or construction necessary to be determined in making any local improvements and to determine whether any work to be done by the city shall be done by contract or by the city. The Council shall have power also, unless otherwise limited, to determine the number of water, sewer and gas laterals that shall be laid to any lot on any street to be improved. If the work or any part thereof is to be done by contract, the Council may let all of the work in one contract, or it may divide it into several contracts, and may let contracts separately. 
Sec. 6.143. - Determination as to cost of improvements. 
    Upon completion of the improvements, the Council shall ascertain the total cost. In addition to other items of cost, there may be included therein the cost of all necessary legal services, the amount of interest paid during construction, the amount of damages paid or to be paid for injury to property by reason of any change of grade or drainage, including court costs and other expenses incidental to the determination of damages, and the cost of retaining walls, sidewalks or fences built or altered in lieu of cash payment for property damage, including the cost of moving or altering any building. The determination of the Council as to the total cost of any improvement shall be conclusive. 
Sec. 6.144. - Preliminary assessment. 
(a)  Having determined the total cost, the Council shall make a preliminary assessment. The preliminary assessment shall be advisory only and shall be subject to modification. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), the preliminary assessment shall be as follows: 
(1)  Roadway paving. The total cost of any roadway paving improvement, excluding the cost incurred at street intersections, shall be specially assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting the street containing the roadway paved, according to the frontages thereon, by an equal rate per foot of frontage, except that, where the petition so requested, the cost shall be assessed against the lands on one side of the street only or against such lands as were designated in the petition. Nothing herein contained shall limit the power of the Council to contract with any property owner for such improvements. 
(2)  Water mains and sewers. The cost of not exceeding an eight-inch water or sanitary sewer main and of not exceeding a thirty-inch storm sewer main shall be assessed against the abutting property. Such cost shall be assessed against the lots and parcels of land according to their respective frontages thereon by an equal rate per foot of such frontage. If a water or sanitary sewer main in excess of eight inches in size or a storm sewer in excess of thirty inches in size is laid, the excess cost shall be borne by the city. As a part of the extension of water or sewer mains, pumping stations, discharge lines, and outfalls may be constructed and the cost thereof assessed against the property to be served at an equal rate on an acreage basis or front foot basis; provided, that nothing herein contained shall limit the power of the council to contract with any property owner for such facilities. The entire cost of each water and sewer lateral shall be specially charged against the particular lot or parcel of land for or in connection with which it was constructed, except that the assessments shall be calculated as if the lateral were laid from the center of the street. The cost of installing storm sewers may, however, be assessed as part of the cost of roadway paving. 
(3)  Sidewalks. The total cost of constructing or reconstructing sidewalks shall be assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting that side of the street upon which the improvement is made according to their respective frontages thereon by an equal rate per foot of such frontage, the lots within a block being deemed to abut upon a sidewalk although the latter extends beyond the lot to the curb line of an intersecting street. The total cost of constructing portions of driveways within the street area shall be assessed against the lots for which they are constructed. 
(4)  Grass plots. The entire cost of grading or otherwise improving or of planting the grass plots in any street or part thereof shall be assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting the street or part thereof where or whereon the improvements are made by an equal rate per front foot of such frontage; provided, that this subsection shall be construed to mean that when a grass plot in any street is graded or planted or otherwise improved, the cost thereof shall be assessed against all of the property abutting the street within the block where such grass plot is located. 
(b)  If the petition (or the resolution in those cases where the improvement was ordered made without petition) specified that there should be specially assessed against the abutting property a smaller proportion of the cost of any improvement than that set forth in subsection (2), there shall be assessed against abutting property only the proportion of the cost as was specified in the petition or in said resolution. No restriction or denial of access to an abutting street shall affect the levy or collection of any assessment for local improvements. 
(c)  The cost of paving, water, sewer, and sidewalk improvements upon, in, or to any portion of a right-of-way or any property owner by the State of North Carolina, any agency or subdivision thereof, shall be assessed against the right-of-way or property and shall be paid by the State, its agency or subdivision. 
(S.L. 1961, Ch. 686, § 20; S.L. 1971, Ch. 29, § 6) 
Sec. 6.145. - Corner lot exemptions. 
    The Council shall have authority to determine the amount and applicability of assessment exemptions for corner lots, and to distinguish between different classifications of property uses. The exemptions for paving, sidewalk, and storm sewer improvements shall not exceed sixty feet and shall be limited to residential uses, and the exemptions for water mains and sanitary sewers shall not exceed one hundred and fifty feet for residential uses and one hundred feet for business uses. If the corner formed by two intersecting streets is rounded into a curve or is foreshortened for the purpose of providing sight distance or for any other purpose of construction, the frontage for assessment purposes shall be calculated to the midpoint of the curve or foreshortened corner. 
Sec. 6.146. - Preliminary assessment roll. 
    The Council shall cause to be prepared a preliminary assessment roll, on which shall be entered a brief description of each lot or parcel of land assessed, the amount assessed against each lot, the name or names of the owner or owners of each lot, as far as the same can be ascertained; however, if any parcel, lot or plot to be assessed has less than the minimum dimensions required by any applicable ordinances of the City of Greensboro, such lot, parcel or plot shall, for purposes of assessment, be combined with other adjoining property, parcels, lots or plots which are in the same undivided ownership, and the total combined lots shall be assessed as one lot; provided, that a map of the improvements on which is shown the frontage and location of each affected lot, together with the amount assessed against each lot and the name or names of the owner or owners thereof, as far as the same can be ascertained, shall be a sufficient assessment roll. If the resolution directed the making of more than one improvement, a single preliminary assessment roll for all the improvements authorized by such resolution shall be sufficient, but the cost of each improvement to each lot affected shall be shown separately. After the preliminary assessment roll has been completed, it shall be filed in the office of the city clerk, and there shall be published in some newspaper published in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices, or if there be no such newspaper, the city clerk shall cause to be posted in three public places in the city, a notice of the completion of the assessment roll, setting forth a description in general terms of the improvements, the amount of each assessment, and stating the time fixed for the meeting of the council for the hearing of objections to the special assessments, such meeting to be not earlier than ten days after the first publication or from the date of posting of said notice. Any number of assessment rolls may be included in one notice. In any case where the preliminary notice was served or mailed instead of being published, this notice need not be published or posted but may be served or mailed. The serving or mailing of notices shall be completed not less than five days prior to the date fixed for the hearing of the assessment roll, and the return of the person serving or mailing the same shall in the absence of fraud be conclusive the same were served or mailed. 
(S.L. 1963, Ch. 55, § 1) 
Sec. 6.147. - Hearing; revision; confirmation; lien. 
    At the time appointed for that purpose or at some other time to which it may adjourn, the Council shall hear objections to the preliminary assessment roll of all persons interested who may appear and offer proof in relation thereto. Then or thereafter, the Council shall either annul or sustain or modify in whole or in part the assessment, either by confirming the preliminary assessment against any or all lots or parcels described thereon, or by cancelling, increasing or reducing the same, according to the special benefits which the Council decides each of the lots or parcels has received or will receive on account of the improvements, except that assessments against railroads because of contract or franchise obligations shall be in accordance with such obligations. If any property is omitted from the preliminary roll, the Council may place it on the roll and levy the proper assessment. The Council may thereupon confirm the assessment roll, and the assessments so confirmed shall be in proportion to the special benefits, except in the case of franchise obligations of railroads. Whenever the governing body shall confirm assessments for local improvements, the city clerk shall enter on the Council minutes and on the assessment roll the date, hour, and minute of confirmation, and from the time of confirmation the assessments shall be a lien on the property assessed of the same nature and to the same extent as county and city taxes and shall be superior to all other liens and encumbrances. After the assessment roll is confirmed a copy of the same shall be delivered to the city tax collector. 
Sec. 6.148. - Appeal to superior court. 
    If the owner of, or any person interested in, any lot or parcel of land against which an assessment is made is dissatisfied with the amount of the assessment, he may, within ten days after confirmation of the assessment roll, give written notice to the Council that he takes an appeal to the Superior Court of Guilford County, in which case he shall within twenty days after the confirmation of the assessment roll serve on the mayor or city clerk a statement of facts upon which he bases his appeal. The appeal shall be tried as other actions at law. The remedy herein provided for any person dissatisfied with the amount of the assessment against any property of which he is the owner or in which he is interested shall be conclusive. 
Sec. 6.149. - Power to correct error in assessment. 
    If it shall appear after confirmation of any assessment roll that an error has been made, the city clerk shall cause to be published one time in some newspaper published in the city, or if there be no such newspaper, the city clerk shall cause to be posted at three public places in the city, a notice referring to the assessment roll in which the error was made, naming the owner or owners of the lot or parcel of land affected by the error, if the same can be ascertained, and naming the time and place fixed for a hearing by the Council for the correction of the error, such meeting not to be earlier than ten days from the publication or from the date of the posting of the notice. At the time fixed in the notice or at some subsequent time to which the Council may adjourn, the Council, after giving the owner or owners of the property affected and other persons interested therein an opportunity to be heard, may proceed to correct the error, and the assessment then made shall have the same force and effect as if it had originally been properly made. No notice and hearing shall be necessary if the correction does not increase an assessment against any property not owned by the city, or if all of the property owners affected by the correction waive notice in writing. 
Sec. 6.150. - Reassessment. 
    The Council shall have the power, when in its judgment there is any irregularity, omission, error or lack of jurisdiction in any of the proceedings relating thereto, to set aside the whole of the local assessment made by it, and thereupon to make a reassessment. In such cases there shall be included, as a part of the cost of the improvements involved, all interest paid or accrued on notes or certificates of indebtedness, or bonds issued by the city to pay the expenses of such improvement. The proceeding shall, as far as practicable, be in all respects as in the case of original assessments, and the reassessment shall have the same force as if it had originally been properly made. 
Sec. 6.151. - Publication of notice of confirmation of assessment roll. 
    After the expiration of twenty days from the confirmation of the assessment roll, the city clerk shall cause to be published one time in some newspaper published in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices, or, if there be no such newspaper, shall cause to be posted at three public places in the city, a notice of confirmation of the assessment roll, and that assessment may be paid at any time before the expiration of thirty days from the date of publication or posting of the notice, without interest from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll, but that if such assessment is not paid in full within said time, all installments thereof shall bear interest at the rate fixed by general law for interest on assessments levied for public improvements and shall run from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll. 
(S.L. 1971, Ch. 29, § 7) 
Sec. 6.152. - Payment of assessments in cash or by installments. 
    The property owner or railroad company assessed shall have the option of paying for improvements in cash or in not less than two or more than ten equal annual installments as may have been determined in the resolution ordering the improvements. If paid in installments, installments shall bear interest at the rate fixed by general law for interest on assessments levied for public improvements and shall run from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll. If any assessment is not paid in cash, the first installment with interest shall become due and payable thirty days after the publication or posting of the notice of confirmation, and one subsequent installment and interest shall be due and payable on the same day of the month in each successive year until the assessment is paid in full; provided, however, that if the Council shall so direct installments shall become due and payable on the same date when property taxes of the city are due and payable. If any installment with interest is not paid when due, it shall be subject to the same penalties as are now prescribed by law for unpaid taxes, in addition to the interest herein provided for. The whole assessment may be paid at any time by the payment of the full amount due with accrued interest. 
(S.L. 1971, Ch. 29, § 8) 
Sec. 6.153. - Enforcement of payment of assessments. 
    Upon the failure of any property owner to pay any installment when due and payable, all of the installments remaining unpaid shall immediately become due and payable, and property and rights-of-way may be sold by the city under the same rules, regulations, rights of redemption and savings as are now prescribed by law for the sale of land for unpaid taxes. Unpaid assessments, interest, and penalties owed by railroad companies and the State of North Carolina, its agencies or subdivisions, may be collected by writs of mandamus issued by the Superior Court of Guilford County. Collection of assessments with interest and penalties may also be made by the city by proceedings to foreclose the lien of assessments as a lien for mortgages is or may be foreclosed under the laws of the State, and it shall be lawful to join in any bill for foreclosure any one or more lots or parcels of land, by whomsoever owned, is assessed for an improvement ordered by the same resolution, after default in the payment of any installment. The payment of said installment, together with interest and penalties due thereon, before the lot or parcel of land, against which the same is a lien, is sold or said lien is foreclosed shall bar the right of the city to sell land or to foreclose the lien by reason of default. 
Sec. 6.154. - Assessment of cost of water main and sewer extensions. 
    If the resolution ordering the making of any improvement or improvements included a provision for any necessary extension of a water main or sewer or sewers beyond the limit of a street or streets, at such time after the completion of said extension or extensions as, in the judgment of the Council, circumstances justify the assessment of the cost thereof, the Council shall cause a preliminary assessment to be made and the procedure thereafter to be followed with respect to such assessment and the force and effect thereof shall be as already prescribed for other assessments. 
Sec. 6.155. - Apportionment of assessments. 
    In any case where one or more special assessments have been made, and property has been, or is about to be, subdivided, and it is desirable that the assessments be apportioned among the subdivisions of such property, the Council may, upon application by the owner or owners, apportion the assessments among the subdivisions. Thereafter, each subdivision shall be relieved of any part of the original assessment except the part apportioned to the subdivision, and the part of the original assessment apportioned to any subdivision shall be of the same force and effect as the original assessment. 
Sec. 6.156. - Change of ownership. 
    No change of ownership of any property or interest therein after the passage of a resolution ordering the making of a local improvement shall affect subsequent proceedings, and the improvement may be completed and assessment made therefor as if there had been no change in ownership. 
Sec. 6.157. - Lands subject to assessment. 
    No lands in the city, including railroad company lands and rights-of-way and property of the State of North Carolina, its agencies or subdivisions shall be exempt from special assessments except lands belonging to the United States which are exempt under the provisions of Federal Statutes, and the Council and the officers, trustees or boards of all incorporated or unincorporated bodies in whom is vested the right to hold and dispose of real property shall have the right by authority duly given to sign the petition for any local improvements. 
Sec. 6.158. - Proceedings in rem. 
    All proceedings for special assessments shall be proceedings in rem, and no mistake or omission as to the name of any owner or person interested in any lot or parcel of land affected thereby shall be regarded as a substantial mistake or omission. 
Sec. 6.159. - Grass plot and driveway maintenance. 
    It shall be the responsibility of the abutting property owner to maintain any grass plot or driveway between the property line and the curb of a paved street. 
Sec. 6.160. - Council may hold in abeyance certain water and sewer assessments. 
(a)  The City Council may provide by resolution that assessments levied against abutting lots or parcels of land for water main improvements or sanitary sewer improvements, when in its opinion such improvements may not presently be used by the owner or owners of the abutting lots or parcels of land, may be held in abeyance without the payment of any interest thereon until such time as the Council shall determine that any such assessments shall be paid in accordance with the terms set out in the confirming resolution. A part of the assessments, levied for the improvements herein set out on a street or streets, or portion thereof, may be held in abeyance as herein provided without holding all of said assessments in abeyance. 
(b)  All statutes of limitations, and particularly the statute of limitations provided for in Chapter 331, Section 1, of Public Laws 1929 (G. S. 160-93) are hereby suspended during the time that any assessment is held in abeyance without the payment of interest, as provided in subsection (a). Such time shall not be a part of the time limited for the commencement of action for the enforcement of the payment of any such assessment, and such action may be brought at any time within ten years from the date of the adoption of a resolution by the Council, determining that such assessment shall be paid in accordance with the original resolution confirming it. 
(c)  Nothing herein shall be construed to revive any right of action which has heretofore been barred by the statute of limitations. 
Sec. 6.161. - Abutting property outside city limits. 
    If any lots or parcels of land abutting any local improvements are located outside the city limits, the Council may continue and delay the levy of assessments against such property until the city limits are extended to include such property, or the Council may provide that no water or sewer service connections shall be made to such property, pending the annexation thereof, until all assessments thereon are paid. Upon annexation, if not paid prior thereto, the Council may levy assessments for such local improvements against such property, and the procedure therefor shall be the same as provided in this charter. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to prohibit or restrict the City Council and a property owner from entering into an agreement for payments in lieu of assessments. 
Sec. 6.162. - Acceptance of deed in lieu of taxes or assessments or both. 
    When taxes or assessments for local improvements or both are due on real property located in the city, the owner or owners thereof may convey such real property to the city in payment of such taxes or assessments or both; provided, that such conveyance to the city shall not interfere with the lien for taxes due any taxing unit other than the city. Any real property conveyed to the city may be sold by it as provided in this Charter. The acceptance of deeds in satisfaction of taxes or assessments or both and the sales of such property are hereby validated. 
(S.L. 1961, Ch. 686, § 21) 
Sec. 6.163. - Authority to acquire entire lot, block or tract. 
    Whenever it appears that a portion of a building or other structure must be demolished in order to complete any local improvements, or that the residual portion of a lot, block or tract of land, remaining unused upon the completion of any local improvements, will be substandard according to applicable subdivision, zoning or other requirements pertaining thereto, or, if in the opinion of the City Council, it will become impractical to use the remaining property because of other conditions, the City Council is authorized, but not required, to acquire the entire lot, block, or tract by purchase or condemnation and to provide for the sale or exchange of said residual property as provided by Sections 4.122, 4.123 or 4.124 of this charter.

(S.L. 1961, Ch. 686, § 23; S.L. 1963, Ch. 55, § 12; S.L. 1973, Ch. 213, § 24; S.L. 1981, Ch. 159, § 7; S.L. 1991, Ch. 4, § 4; S.L. 1995, Ch. 680, § 1; S.L. 2004-5, H.B. 1604, eff. 6-14-04) 
SUBCHAPTER B. - CLAIMS BY THE CITY 

Sec. 7.21. - Settlement of claims by the city manager. 
    The city manager is hereby authorized to execute releases of persons, firms and corporations because of damages to personal property belonging to City of Greensboro when the full amount of damages to such property is ascertained and a statement thereof has been furnished to the city manager by the city attorney and the amount of such release does not exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). In the event that draft or check is presented to the city which constitutes a release, instead of a regular release form, the city manager is hereby authorized to direct that such draft or check be handled as other payments to the city and, when approved by the city manager, shall constitute a release to the extent stated on the draft or check. 
(S.L. 1961, Ch. 686, § 24; S.L. 1963, Ch. 55, § 13; S.L. 1977, Ch. 85, § 2; S.L. 1981, Ch. 159, § 8; S.L. 1995, Ch. 680, § 2) 
SUBCHAPTER C. - WAIVER OF GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITY 

Sec. 7.41. - Authority of city council. 
    The city council, by causing liability insurance to be provided by the city, is hereby authorized and empowered, but not required, to waive its governmental immunity from liability for any damage by reason of death or injury to person or property proximately caused by the negligent act of an officer, agent or employee of the city when acting within the scope of his authority and within the course of his employment. Such immunity is waived only to the extent of the amount of the insurance, and shall be deemed to have been waived in the absence of affirmative action by the city council. 
(S.L. 1961, Ch. 686, § 25) 
Sec. 7.42. - Contract of insurance; payment of premiums. 
    The contract of insurance purchased pursuant to this subchapter must be issued by a company licensed to execute insurance contracts in this state, and must insure the city against liability for any damage by reason of death or injury to person or property proximately caused by the negligent act of any officer, agent or employee of the city when acting within the scope of his authority and within the course of his employment. By such act, any company which enters into a contract of insurance as above described waives any defense based upon the governmental immunity of the city from liability. The city treasurer is authorized and empowered to pay, as a necessary expense, the premiums for each insurance out of the general fund of the city. 
(S.L. 1961, Ch. 696, § 25) 
Sec. 7.43. - Actions for negligence. 
    Any person sustaining damage, or, in case of death, his personal representative, may sue the city for the recovery of such damages, and it shall be no defense to any such action that the officer, agent, or employee involved was in pursuance of a governmental, municipal or discretionary function of the city if, and to the extent, the city has insurance coverage, as provided by this subchapter, at the time the cause of action arises. Except as hereinbefore expressly provided, nothing in this subchapter, shall be construed to deprive the city of any defense or to restrict, limit or otherwise affect any defense which the city may have at common law or by virtue of any statute (whether general, special, private or local), and nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to relieve any person sustaining damages, or any personal representative of the same, from any duty to give notice of claim to the city, or to commence any civil action for the recovery of damages within the period of time prescribed by statute. The city's liability insurance shall not be brought to the attention of the trial jury or prospective trial jurors, and, if brought to the attention of the trial jury, an order of mistrial shall be entered. The plaintiff shall be deemed to have waived the right to have a jury determine all issues of law or fact relating to insurance, and the jury shall be absent during any motions, arguments, testimony or announcement of findings of fact or conclusion of law with respect thereto unless the defendant shall ask for a jury trial thereon.

It is further declared that notwithstanding any change or modification of the North Carolina General Statutes or any other state law, all sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code will remain unaffected and in full force and effect, to the extent such described severable parts of the Code do not conflict with the changes and modifications to the General Statutes or other state law.

Sec. 2-117. - Minority/women's business enterprise participation in city construction, professional services, goods and other services contracts. 
Recitals 
This section establishes an minority/women's business enterprise policy to authorize the city manager to adopt and administer a "M/WBE program" for firms that engage in business with the City of Greensboro. The purposes of this section are: (a) to establish a clear policy against discrimination in business transactions and dealings on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, age, or disability; (b) to authorize and direct the establishment and administration of narrowly tailored policy and contracting procedures by the city manager to remedy the ongoing effects of identified marketplace discrimination that is adversely affecting the award of prime contracts and subcontracts to minority- and women-owned businesses in city contracts; and (c) to authorize and direct the establishment and administration of narrowly tailored policy and contracting procedures by the city manager to prevent the city from becoming a passive participant in private sector marketplace discrimination that is adversely affecting the formation, growth, and competitiveness of small, minority, and women-owned business enterprises in the city's relevant geographic market from which it routinely purchases goods and services. 
The city council finds that in order to avoid becoming a passive participant in private sector commercial discrimination, it is necessary to establish and firmly enforce a clear policy against discrimination in business on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, age, or disability. Under this policy, the city shall not contract with business firms that discriminate in the solicitation, selection, hiring, or treatment of vendors, suppliers, subcontractors, or commercial customers. Such a commercial non-discrimination policy approach has been favorably commented upon by the United States Supreme Court in City of Richmond v. J. A. Croson, 488 U.S. 469, 509-510 (1989), and by other federal courts. 
After careful and lengthy consideration of a strong basis in evidence, including, but not limited to, disparity studies conducted by the North Carolina Institute of Minority Economic Development in 1992 and 1997, MGT of America, Inc. in 2012, and most recently by Griffin & Strong, P.C., in 2018, (the findings and recommendations of the latter having been formally adopted by city council on August 21, 2018), the city council has further determined that it continues to have a compelling interest in assuring that the public funds that are collected from all of its citizens and then spent in city contracting do not serve to finance private prejudice on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, age, disability, or any other form of unlawful discrimination. The city council has further considered a full range of narrowly tailored race- and gender-neutral and race- and gender-conscious remedial policy options that were presented to city council on August 21, 2018, and that are legally defensible and effective for addressing identified barriers to the full and equal participation of small and minority-owned businesses in city contracting. By this section, city council authorizes and directs the city manager to adopt and administer an M/WBE program that is based upon this factual predicate and consistent with these identified remedial policy options. 
The city council further determines that it is in the best interests of the City of Greensboro to enhance competition on city projects by promoting equal opportunity and the full participation of all segments of its business community in a robust and inclusive marketplace environment that is free from the effects of discrimination. The city is likely to benefit from a discrimination-free marketplace through lower prices for the goods and services it purchases, higher revenues through increased employment opportunities for its citizens, increased business-to-business sales, and a more vibrant local economy. 
The city manager or designee(s), are authorized and directed to administer a minority/women business enterprise program ("M/WBE program") for application to the city's procedures for the solicitation, selection, and award of city contracts and subcontracts for construction, professional services, goods and other services. The M/WBE program shall be consistent with the city council's factual findings, and the range of remedial policy options considered by city council, as follows: 
(a)  It is the policy of the city to provide minorities and women equal opportunity to participate in all aspects of city contracting and purchasing programs, including but not limited to participation in procurement contracts for commodities and services as well as for contracts relating to construction and repair work activities. It is further the policy of the city to prohibit discrimination in business transactions and dealings on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, age or disability; 
(b)  The M/WBE program is narrowly tailored to ensure policy and contracting procedures to remedy the ongoing effects of identified marketplace discrimination that is adversely affecting the award of prime contracts and subcontracts to minority- and women-owned businesses in city contracts; and 
(c)  The city manager is authorized to assign duties, responsibilities and establish appropriate procedures for administration and implementation of a narrowly tailored policy and contracting procedures to prevent the City from becoming a passive participant in private sector marketplace discrimination that is adversely affecting the formation, growth, and competitiveness of minority- and women-owned business enterprises within the city's relevant geographic market from which it routinely purchases goods and services. The plan shall contain goals, standards and criteria for implementation in accordance with state and federal laws. In addition, the plan shall be subject to review and approval of the city council.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 13-132, § 1, adopted Oct. 15, 2013, amended § 2-117 in its entirety to read as set out herein. Former § 2-117 pertained to minority/women's business enterprise participation in city procurement and construction contracts and derived from the Code of 1961, §§ 5A-35, 5A-36. 
Sec. 2-118. - Extensions and change orders. 
    For any contract involving a construction project, the city manager is authorized, in his sound judgment and discretion, to approve change orders and extensions in such construction contracts up to an amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) for each such change order or extension, or change orders in any amount where a specific emergency exists. Such approval shall be valid provided that the city treasurer has verified the amount of funds available and the approval of the city attorney as to legality has been secured. In order to implement any such change orders and extensions in the manner hereinabove set out, the city manager may further authorize payment and allocation of funds as necessary for the accomplishment thereof. Any change orders and extensions approved hereunder exceeding two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) shall be reported to the city council at its next regular meeting and entered in the minutes. For purposes of this section, "specific emergency" shall mean a sudden unexpected or unforeseeable occurrence which requires immediate corrective action to secure public health and safety.

ARTICLE II. - GRANT OF FRANCHISE 

Sec. 7-4. - Grant of franchise. 
(a)  Grant. Pursuant to the authority of the City Charter and general statutory laws subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the city can grant revocable and nonexclusive franchises, acting pursuant to the state enabling law and the city's applicable charter provisions, ordinances, rules and regulations to construct and operate a cable communications system in, under, over, along, across or upon the streets and public grounds within the City of Greensboro for the purpose of reception, transmission, collection, amplification, origination, distribution or redistribution of audio, video, data, or other signals and for the development of broadband telecommunication services in accordance with the laws of the City of Greensboro, the State of North Carolina, and the United States of America. In exercising rights pursuant hereto, the grantee shall not endanger or interfere with the lives of persons, interfere with any installations of the city, any public utility serving the city or any other person permitted to use the streets and public grounds nor unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the streets and public grounds. The grant of one franchise does not establish priority for use over the other present or future permit or franchise holders or the city's own use of the streets and public grounds. The city shall at all times control the distribution of space in, over, under or across all streets or public grounds occupied by the cable communications system. 
    No grant of any franchise shall affect the right of the city to grant to any other person a right to occupy or use the streets, or portions thereof, for the construction and operation of a cable communications system within the city or the right of the city to permit the use of the streets or public grounds of the city for any purpose whatsoever. By accepting a franchise, the franchisee thereby acknowledges the city's right to make such grants and permit such uses. No privilege or power of eminent domain is bestowed on grantee by the grant of a franchise. The city retains the right to exempt systems serving fewer than one thousand (1,000) subscribers from the provisions of this chapter as deemed appropriate by the city at the time a franchise is granted. 
(b)  Event of conflict. In the event of conflict between the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise, this chapter shall control. 
(c)  General city ordinances. Any franchise granted by the city is hereby made subject to the general ordinance provisions now in effect and hereafter made effective. Any provisions hereafter made effective shall not materially effect the grantee's rights under this chapter or the franchise. Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the various codes and ordinances of the city regarding permits, taxes, fees to be paid, or manner of construction. 
(Ord. No. 94-109, § 1, 10-24-94) 
Sec. 7-5. - Franchise area.

The grantee shall use its best efforts to also obtain pole attachment agreements for use of any utility poles or other utility facilities required in connection with the provision of services, provided such agreements are available upon reasonable terms and conditions. 
(Ord. No. 94-109, § 1, 10-24-94) 
Sec. 7-7. - Use of city facilities. 
    At the city's option, the city may require a grantee to utilize city-owned conduit or other facilities for any portion of its cable communications system.

A reasonable fee for the use of city facilities shall be established in the franchise and may be adjusted every five (5) years for inflation in accordance with increases in the Consumer Price Index. 
(Ord. No. 94-109, § 1, 10-24-94) 
Sec. 7-8. - Use of grantee facilities. 
    No poles shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval of the city with regard to location, height, type and any other pertinent aspect, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. However, no location of any pole of the grantee shall be a vested right and such poles shall be removed, relocated or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the city reasonably determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The grantee shall utilize existing poles and conduits, where possible. The city shall have the right, during the life of the franchise, to install and maintain free of charge upon the poles owned by the grantee, any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable system operations of the grantee. 
(Ord. No. 94-109, § 1, 10-24-94) 
Sec. 7-9. - Term of franchise. 
    The term of the franchise shall commence upon execution of the franchise by the city and the grantee and shall continue for a period specified in the franchise, unless sooner terminated as provided herein.

Such grantee shall continue to pay its franchise fees to the county so long as said grantee is in operation and serving under the county franchise. Provided, however, no such grantee shall be permitted to extend its operations (or plant) into the city limits of the city as those limits exist on the effective date of this chapter [October 23, 1994] unless such grantee shall acquire a franchise from the city. At such time as such grantee's franchise with the county shall expire, it shall not continue to provide cable television services within the city limits without first having acquired a franchise from the city. 
(Ord. No. 94-109, § 1, 10-24-94) 
Sec. 7-12. - Police and regulatory powers reserved. 
    The grantee shall comply with all generally applicable laws, ordinances and regulations enacted by the city pursuant to its police powers. Any conflict between the terms of this chapter or the franchise and any present or future lawful exercise of the city's police powers shall be resolved in favor of police powers; provided, however, no such exercise of the police powers shall materially alter the terms and provisions of any franchise granted hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 94-109, § 1, 10-24-94) 
Sec. 7-13. - City's right to perform public works. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be in hindrance to the right of the city or any governmental authority to perform or carry on, directly or indirectly, any public works or public improvements of any description. Should the cable communications system in any way interfere with the construction, maintenance or repair of such public works or public improvements, the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, protect or relocate its cable communications system, or part thereof, as reasonably directed by the city officials or any governmental authority. 
(Ord. No. 94-109, § 1, 10-24-94) 
Sec. 7-14. - Emergency removal of plant. 
    If at any time, in case of fire or disaster in the city, it shall become necessary in the reasonable judgment of the city to cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances or appurtenances of the cable communications system, the city shall have the right to do so at the sole cost and expense of the grantee. The grantee shall bear all costs of reinstallation, repair, and other costs resulting from or arising out of the emergency cutting or removal of the cable communications system. 
(Ord. No. 94-109, § 1, 10-24-94) 
Sec. 7-15. - Removal or abandonment. 
    Upon termination of the franchise by passage of time or otherwise, and unless the grantee transfers the cable communications system to a subsequent grantee approved by the city, the grantee shall remove its supporting structures, poles, transmission and distribution systems, and all other appurtenances from the streets and public rights-of-way and shall restore any property, public or private, to their original condition prior to the installation, erection, or construction of the cable communications system. Restoration of city property, including, but not limited to the public rights-of-way, shall be in accordance with the directions and specifications of all affected departments and agencies of the city and all applicable law. The grantee, at the option and direction of the city, shall accomplish such restoration at its expense. Such removal shall be made with the supervision of the city. If such removal and restoration is not completed within twelve (12) months after the notice by the city delivered in writing to the grantee, all of the grantee's property remaining in the affected public rights-of-way, at the option of the city, shall be deemed abandoned and, at the option of the city, shall become the property of the city. In the event the grantee fails or refuses to remove its system or satisfactorily restore all areas to the condition in which they existed prior to the original construction of the system, the city, at its option, may perform such work and collect the cost thereof from the grantee. No surety on any bond shall be discharged until the city has certified to the grantee in writing that the system has been dismantled, removed, and all other property restored to the satisfaction of the city. 
(Ord. No. 94-109, § 1, 10-24-94) 
Sec. 7-16. - Time is of the essence to this chapter. 
    Whenever this chapter shall set forth any time for any act to be performed by or on behalf of the grantee, such time shall be deemed to be of the essence. Any failure of the grantee to perform within the time allotted shall be sufficient ground for the city to invoke an appropriate penalty including possible revocation of the franchise, following applicable notices of default and cure procedures provided for herein. 
(Ord. No. 94-109, § 1, 10-24-94) 
Sec. 7-17. - No waiver of rights. 
    No course of dealing between the grantee and the city nor any delay on the part of the city in exercising any rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any such rights of the city or acquiescence in the actions of the grantee in contravention of rights except to the extent expressly waived by the city or expressly provided for in the franchise. 
(Ord. No. 94-109, § 1, 10-24-94) 
Sec. 7-18. - Transfer of ownership or control. 
(a)  Transfer of franchise. Any franchise granted hereunder cannot in any event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, including but not limited to, by force or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership or other means without the prior consent of the city, and then only under such conditions as the city may reasonably establish. 
(b)  Transfer threshold. The grantee shall promptly notify the city of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of ownership, or control of the grantee. The word "control," as used herein, is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the disposal by the grantee, directly or indirectly, by gift, assignment, voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of ten (10) percent or more at one (1) time of the controlling interest in the system, or twenty-five (25) percent cumulatively over the term of the franchise of such interests to a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, trust or association, or person or group of persons acting in concert. Except that no consent shall be required for any sale, transfer, or assignment of ownership or control to an entity under common control with grantee, provided that prior to such transfer, the grantee provides to the city verifiable information to establish that such transferee under common control has the financial, legal and technical ability to fully perform all obligations of the franchise. 
(c)  City approval. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the city shall have consented thereto. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the city may inquire into the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and the grantee shall provide the city with all required information. Failure to provide all information reasonably requested by the city as part of said inquiry shall be grounds for denial of the proposed change, transfer or acquisition of control. 
(d)  Assumption of control. The city agrees that any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the city that it will take control and operate the cable television system. If the financial institution takes possession of the cable communications system, the city shall take no action to effect a termination of the franchise without first giving to the lender written notice thereof and a period of six (6) months thereafter (unless otherwise provided hereinbelow) (i) to allow the financial institution or its agent(s) to continue operating as the franchisee under the franchise; and (ii) to request the city, and for the city to determine whether, to consent to the assignment of the grantees rights, title, interest and obligations under the franchise to a qualified operator. The city acknowledges that in order for the financial institution to realize upon the collateral accorded to it by the loan documents, the financial institution must be entitled to a reasonable period of time after taking possession of the franchise under the loan document to obtain the city's consent to an assignment of the franchise to a qualified operator. The city agrees that such reasonable period of time is six (6) months after the financial institution takes possession of the cable communication system, and, further, agrees that the city shall use its best efforts to decide upon the assignment of the franchise to the new operator proposed by the financial institution within such period of time. The financial institution shall be entitled to such possession and other rights granted under this paragraph until such time that the city determines whether to consent to such assignment (the "extended time"). If the city finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualifications of the applicant, is satisfactory, the city will consent to the transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest. During the six-month period or extended time, the financial institution shall enjoy all the rights, benefits and privileges of the grantee under the franchise, and the city shall not disturb such possession by the financial institution, provided the financial institution complies in all respects with the terms and provisions of the franchise and this chapter. The various rights granted to the financial institution under this paragraph are contingent upon the lender's continuous compliance with the terms and provisions of this chapter and the franchise during the entire aforementioned six-month period or extended time, if applicable. For example, should an agent of the financial institution take possession of the cable communication system pursuant to rights granted to the financial institution under this paragraph and such agent fails to comply with the level of service requirements set forth in this chapter or the franchise, the rights granted to the financial institution under the provisions of this chapter and the franchise shall automatically terminate. 
(e)  No waiver of city property rights. The consent or approval of the city or any other public entity to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the city in and to the public property or public rights-of-way, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise. 
(f)  Review purchase price. The city shall be notified of the purchase price of any transfer or assignment of the cable system based on available documents. 
(g)  Signatory requirement. Any approval by the city of transfer of ownership or control shall be contingent upon the prospective controlling party becoming a signatory to the franchise agreement. 
(h)  Right of first purchase. The city reserves the right of first purchase in any sale, transfer, lease, assignment or disposal of the majority interest or more of the cable system serving the City of Greensboro, when such sale, transfer, lease, assignment or disposal of the majority interest or more affects only the system serving Greensboro. If the city decides to exercise this option, it shall give the grantee notice of its intent within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice that the grantee proposes to sell, transfer, lease, assign, or dispose of the system. Should the city exercise this option, the purchase price will be the fair market value. In the event that the city and grantee are unable to agree upon the value of the system, the matter will be submitted to arbitration as specified in section 7-19(a)(6). 
(Ord. No. 94-109, § 1, 10-24-94)

In accordance with the Cable Act, in the event the grantee (a) forfeits and the city terminates the franchise, pursuant to provisions of this chapter and the franchise, or (b) the franchise is not renewed at the normal expiration of the franchise term and the grantee has exhausted all rights to renewal under the Cable Act, the city shall have the right, directly or as an intermediary, to purchase the franchised cable communications system or effect the ownership of the system to another person. In the instance of non-renewal any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern, but with no value allocated to the franchise itself. If the franchise is revoked for cause, the acquisition or transfer shall be at an equitable price. If the system is purchased at the time of transfer, the acquisition shall be at fair market value. The city shall notify the grantee, in writing, within thirty (30) days, of its intent to acquire the system on its behalf or effectuate the ownership of the system to another person. The purchase price shall be based upon the value of the system determined pursuant to this section. 
(2)  Date of valuation. The date of valuation shall be no earlier than the day following the date of expiration or termination and no later than the date the city makes an offer for the system. 
(3)  System valuation. The value of the cable system shall be determined by a qualified appraiser mutually agreed upon by the city and the grantee. The city shall hire a qualified appraiser. The appraiser shall determine the current worth of the assets pursuant to subsection (a)(1) above. Under no circumstances shall the value under this section be less than the book value of the assets less accumulated depreciation. In the case of termination or non-renewal, no value shall be assigned to the franchise. 
(4)  Intent to purchase. Upon receipt of notice of the city's intent to purchase the system at the value established above, the grantee shall have thirty (30) days within which to accept that valuation as the purchase price of the system. In the event that purchase price is not acceptable, the parties shall have one hundred twenty (120) days in which to negotiate an acceptable purchase price. 
(5)  Transfer to city. Upon exercise of this option, and the payment of the agreed upon sum by the city and its service of official notice of such action upon the grantee, the grantee shall immediately transfer to the city possession and title to all facilities and property, real and personal, of the cable communications system, free from any and all liens and encumbrances not agreed to be assumed by the city in lieu of some portion of the purchase price set forth above; and the grantee shall execute such warranty, deeds or other instruments of conveyance to the city as shall be necessary for this purpose. 
(6)  Arbitration. In the event the city and grantee are unable to agree upon the value of the cable communications system within the time limits set forth above, either party may require by written notice to the other that the value of the cable communications system be submitted to arbitration in the following manner: 
a.  The city and the grantee shall, within fifteen (15) days after such written notice, each select an arbitrator who shall be a disinterested person with reasonable knowledge and experience relative to the subject to be arbitrated. The two (2) arbitrators thus selected shall immediately thereafter select a third arbitrator who shall likewise be a disinterested person having reasonable knowledge and experience relative to the subject to be arbitrated. 
b.  The panel of arbitrators shall commence a hearing on the issue of valuation and shall receive all relevant information from the parties. 
c.  The hearing shall be recorded and may be transcribed at the request of either party. All hearing proceedings, debate and deliberations shall be open to the public and at such times and places as contained in the notice or as thereafter publicly stated, except that if two (2) arbitrators agree, debate and deliberations may be held in closed session. 
d.  The value of the system as determined by the arbitration panel shall be pursuant to subsection (a)(1) above. 
(e)  Within thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing, the panel of arbitrators shall prepare the findings and the decision agreed upon by a majority of the panel which shall be filed with the city and served by mail upon the grantee. Should there be no majority decision, the proceedings shall become null and void and shall be started anew, unless the parties extend by mutual agreement the time which the panel of arbitrators has to make a decision. 
(f)  The expenses of the arbitrators shall be borne by the parties, and the expenses of the third arbitrator and those expenses incurred by the panel as a whole shall be borne equally by the parties. 
(7)  Purchase price. The purchase price shall be the value of the system as determined by the arbitration panel subject to the right of either party to seek a judicial determination of the purchase price subsequent to the decision of the arbitration panel.

(a)  [ City findings. ] Because city finds that: 
(1)  The public rights-of-way to be used by the grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the franchise area are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the county, state, and city at great expense to its taxpayers, and 
(2)  The grant to the grantee to the said streets is a valuable property right without which the grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, and 
(3)  The administration of this chapter or the franchise imposes upon the city additional regulatory responsibility and expense, and 
(4)  The grantee of any franchise hereunder shall pay to the city a franchise fee in the amount specified in the franchise.

(d)  Failure to make required payment. In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified herein, the grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the city primary depository bank during the period that such unpaid amount is owed. 
(e)  Payments to be made quarterly. The franchise fee and any other cost or damages assessed shall be payable quarterly to the City of Greensboro. The grantee shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross revenue within the city during the period for which said quarterly payment is made, and said payment shall be made to the city not later than forty-five (45) days after the expiration of each calendar quarter. Quarterly computation dates are the last day in the months of March, June, September and December. 
(f)  City's right to inspection. The city shall have the right to inspect the grantee and any parent company's income records to determine the franchise fee and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under the provisions of this chapter.

The grantee shall provide written notice to each subscriber when equipment is to be installed on the cable communications system which would permit the recording or monitoring of individual viewing habits of such subscriber or household; such equipment shall be installed only after prior written permission has been granted by the subscriber. In no event shall such permission be obtained as a condition of service or continuation thereof. For any sort of transmission to emanate from a subscriber's residence or subscriber household, the subscriber must take some positive action to activate such transmission. In the event the service requested by the subscriber by its nature involves the transfer of information or data from the subscriber or household, including, without limitation, security services or data transfer, the ordering of the service shall be deemed to include the grant of permission by the subscriber or household for the making available of such information to such parties as is necessary for the provision of the service. Written permission shall be obtained from the subscriber prior to further dissemination or distribution by the grantee of such information. 
(l)  Subscriber and user contracts. It is stipulated and agreed by the grantee that section 7-84 and section 7-86 shall be enforceable directly by every aggrieved subscriber or user and by every aggrieved person seeking to become a subscriber or user. The city includes the above referenced sections as part of this chapter pursuant to both its governmental obligations to the residents and institutions of Greensboro, including actual and potential subscribers and users, and as the representatives of such actual and potential subscribers or users. To this end, the grantee agrees to include the following provision in every contract or agreement between the grantee and any subscribers or users entered into after the effective date of the grantee's franchise: 
The subscriber/user as part of this contract, has certain rights of privacy prohibiting the unauthorized monitoring of service and publication of personal information under the control of the grantee, including, without limitation, information regarding program selections or service uses. The grantee shall make available upon the request of the subscriber/user further description of said rights as established in its ordinance and franchise with the City of Greensboro. The grantee further agrees that it will not allege or contend that any actual or potential subscriber or user may not enforce the above referenced sections by reason of lack of privity. 
(m)  Subscriber information to be destroyed. Any information concerning individual subscriber viewing habits or responses, except for information for billing purposes, shall be destroyed within sixty (60) days. Information for billing purposes shall be kept for a minimum of two (2) years unless otherwise required to be kept by law. 
(n)  Investigation and remedial action. For recurrent complaints regarding service deficiencies (other than total or partial loss of service, such as "ghosting," weak audio signal, distortion, and the like), the city manager may require the grantee to investigate and report to him/her the causes and cures thereof, and the city manager may also conduct his/her own investigation. Thereafter, the city manager may order specified remedial action to be taken within reasonably feasible time limits. If such action is not taken, or is ineffective, or if within thirty (30) days the grantee files with the city a notice of objection to the order, the city may conduct a hearing and may, if the evidence warrants a finding of fault on the part of the grantee, take appropriate action pursuant to the terms of this chapter.

(a)  Subscription rights. It shall be the right of all subscribers to receive continuous, uninterrupted service insofar as their financial obligations to the grantee are honored. 
(b)  Failure to provide continuity. In the event the grantee fails to operate the system for seven (7) consecutive days without prior approval of the city or without just cause, the city may, at its option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time as grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the city or a permanent operator is selected. If the city is required to fulfill this obligation for the grantee, the grantee shall reimburse the city for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of revenues from the system received by the city that are the result of the grantee's failure to perform. 
(c)  Extended operation. In the event the franchise is terminated, or upon its expiration, the council may require the grantee to continue operation for a period not exceeding twelve (12) months after the date of the grantee's termination or expiration. Thereafter the grantee shall remove, at its own expense, all portions of its cable television system from all streets and public ways to a condition reasonably satisfactory to the city as specified in section 7-14 and section 7-15. The grantee shall maintain a bond and letters of credit pursuant to section 7-50 until the conclusion of all operations under the franchise and this chapter, including the removal of all equipment and facilities.

The grantee shall not install or permit the installation of any special terminal equipment in any subscriber's premises for the two-way transmission of any aural, visual, or digital signals without the prior written consent of the subscriber. The grantee shall not tabulate, nor permit others to tabulate, any subscriber use of the cable system which would reveal the opinions or commercial product preferences of individual subscribers, whether residential or business, or of any occupant or user of the subscriber's premises without written authorization from the subscriber for his or her participation in a shop-at-home or similar service. When providing such service, the grantee may tabulate only those responses essential to the functioning of that shopping or other service, and may not use any such tabulation of individual preferences for any other purposes without the subscribers consent.

The grantee shall destroy all subscriber or user information of a personally identifiable nature after a reasonable period of time, unless retention of such information is authorized by the affected subscriber or user. 
(f)  Polling by cable. No poll or other upstream response from a subscriber shall be conducted or obtained except as part of a program that contains all explicit disclosure of the nature, purpose and prospective use of the results of the poll or upstream response. The grantee or its agents shall release the results of upstream responses only in the aggregate and without individual references. 
(g)  Monitoring devices. The grantee shall provide written notice to each subscriber when equipment is to be installed on the system which would permit the recording or monitoring of individual viewing habits of a subscriber or household; such equipment shall be installed only after prior written permission has been granted by the subscriber. Such permission may be valid for one (1) year only and may be renewed by permission of the subscriber. In no event shall such permission be obtained as a condition of service or continuation thereof. The grantee shall give each subscriber annual written notice of any such monitoring and of the subscriber's right to terminate the monitoring in accordance with the terms and conditions of the subscriber's contract with the grantee.

It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a process by which those persons desiring to locate a hazardous waste facility may only do so by obtaining a special use permit. It is recognized that the General Assembly of North Carolina has enacted the Hazardous Chemicals Right-to-Know Act [G.S. § 95-173 et seq.], in order to prescribe a safe and uniform system for the disclosure of hazardous chemicals in the work place; and has enacted the Waste Management Act of 1981, as amended, and the Hazardous Waste Treatment Commission Act of 1984, as amended, in order to prescribe a safe and uniform system for the management of hazardous waste. It is the intent of the city council to exercise supplemental local jurisdiction over the stated facilities in a manner consistent with these legislative enactments and pursuant to the powers invested in it by the provisions of North Carolina General Statutes sections 130A-295 and 160A-381, 160A-174, 160A-183, 160A-185, 160A-192 and 160A-193. 
(b)  The purposes of this chapter are to: 
(1)  Ensure that hazardous waste facilities are located and managed in a manner consistent with the promotion of public health, safety and welfare. 
(2)  Ensure that no hazardous waste facility is located within the city's zoning jurisdiction unless a special use permit has been issued by the city council. 
(3)  Ensure that all applicants seeking to obtain a special use permit to locate a hazardous waste facility in Greensboro shall pay the city an application fee set by the city council. 
(4)  Ensure that funds are available through the levy of an annual privilege tax and, where appropriate, a gross receipts tax, to compensate the city for overseeing hazardous waste facilities within its jurisdiction.

(Ord. No. 87-44, § 1(23-91), 4-21-87) 
Sec. 10.5-3. - Existing facilities. 
    Any hazardous waste facility legally existing and operating in the city on April 30, 1987 may continue to operate as long as it continues to hold valid federal or state permits or approvals under which it began operation. Sections 10.5-7 and 10.5-8 shall first apply to existing facilities at the beginning of the city's first full fiscal year after April 30, 1987. 
(Ord. No. 87-44, § 1(23-100), 4-21-87) 
Sec. 10.5-4. - Enforcement and penalties. 
(a)  Generally. The city through its responsible officers shall enforce the provisions of this chapter to ensure and safeguard the public health, safety and welfare. 
(b)  Civil penalty. A civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) may be assessed by the city manager, as the city council's delegate, against any person who violates this chapter or the terms and conditions of a special use permit granted pursuant to this chapter. Each day of a violation shall be treated as a separate offense and shall be subject to the assessment of a civil penalty. Within twenty (20) days after receipt of notice of an assessment, the assessed person must tender payment to the city or submit in writing a statement appealing the assessment and requesting an informal administrative hearing. The statement shall describe the legal and factual issues in dispute. The city council shall conduct a hearing and shall affirm, modify, reverse or remand the city manager's decision. If any civil penalty as finally assessed is not paid, the council shall direct the city attorney to sue to recover the amount of the assessment. The city manager, in assessing a civil penalty, and the city council, in reviewing the assessment, shall take into account: 
(1)  The amount of hazardous waste involved. 
(2)  The degree of toxicity, corrosivity, ignitability, and reactivity of the hazardous waste involved. 
(3)  The degree of care exercised by the violator with respect to the hazardous waste involved, considering the characteristics of such waste. 
(4)  The degree and extent of harm caused or threatened by the violation. 
(5)  The extent of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. 
(6)  The economic benefit of noncompliance to the violator. 
(7)  The extent of the violator's good faith efforts to comply. 
(8)  The cost of correcting the harm caused by the violation if correction is possible. 
(9)  The degree of cooperation by the violator with federal, state and local officials to prevent any harm to public health or the environment. 
(10)  The violator's history of compliance or noncompliance with this chapter. 
(c)  Equitable relief. The city may seek such equitable remedies as are available, including injunctive relief from the superior court division of the general court of justice for the county, to abate a continuing violation. 
(d)  Permit revocation. If, after inspection, authorized representatives of the city manager find that the conditions or practices for which written notice to correct has been given have not been corrected within the ten-day period, the city manager shall notify the permittee by certified mail to cease and desist all activities until the corrections are made. The cease and desist order shall give notice to appear before the city council to show cause why the permit should not be revoked. The city council may revoke the permit, leave it in effect, or add other conditions as it deems necessary because of the violations. Revocation of any federal or state permit or approval automatically revokes the special use permit issued under this chapter. 
(e)  Modification. If a major modification is required for the state or federal permit or approval of a hazardous waste facility permitted by this chapter or an existing facility under section 29-68, the owner or operator of the facility must apply for a modification of the special use permit under this chapter. A processing fee of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) shall be charged for any application for a modification of the special use permit. The planning and community development department shall review the modification under the same procedures employed for initial application and make a recommendation to the city council. 
(f)  [ Civil penalties considered restorative. ] Civil penalties assessed under this section are considered restorative; intended to provide compensation to the city for costs associated with the city's program to monitor, control, prosecute, cure and/or correct the violation. As such, the amount declared herein is presumed to provide sufficient restoration to the city for its costs. 
    The assessment of civil penalties herein is not intended to be an exercise of powers delegated to other agencies or entities created by the General Assembly to regulate the proscribed conduct.

Sec. 11-3. - Findings of fact. 
    The city council hereby finds and declares that there exist within the city limits residential buildings and accessory structures which are unfit for human habitation due to dilapidation, defects increasing the hazards of fire, accidents or other calamities, lack of ventilation, light or sanitary facilities, and other conditions rendering such buildings unsafe or unsanitary, or dangerous, or detrimental to the health, safety or morals, or otherwise inimical to the welfare of the residents within the city, and that public necessity exists to exercise the police powers of the city to cause the repair and rehabilitation, closing or demolishing of such buildings and structures in the manner provided in this chapter. 
    The city council further finds that there exists within the city limits abandoned structures that constitute a health or safety hazard as a result of the attraction of insects or rodents, conditions creating a fire hazard, dangerous conditions constituting a threat to children or frequent use by vagrants as living quarters in the absence of sanitary facilities. 
    The U.S. Census Bureau has forecast that North Carolina's population will increase by more than four million (4,000,000) people between 2000 and 2030 so the city council finds that housing preservation initiatives are warranted rather than relying only on a demolition program.

Sec. 11-39. - Procedures. 
(a)  Whenever a petition is filed with the inspector by a public authority or by at least five (5) residents of the city charging that any building or accessory structure is unfit for human habitation or whenever it appears to the inspector (on his own motion) that any such building or accessory structure is unfit for human habitation, the inspector shall, if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner or any parties in interest in such building, a complaint stating the charges and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the inspector (or his designated agent) at a place therein fixed within the city, not less than ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days after the serving of said complaint; the owners and parties in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint; notice of such hearing shall also be given to at least one (1) of the persons signing any petition relating to such building; any person desiring to do so may attend such hearing and give evidence relevant to the matter being heard. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the inspector. 
(b)  If, after such notice and hearing, the inspector determines that the building under consideration is unfit for human habitation in accordance with the standards herein set forth, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order. In addition, the inspector shall cause notice of the order to repair the building or otherwise demolish to be mailed by first-class mail to any organization involved in providing or restoring dwellings for affordable housing that has filed a written request for such notices. Such orders shall be mailed at least forty-five (45) days before the inspector may cause such building to be demolished, in order to allow the opportunity for any organization to negotiate with the owner to make repairs, lease, or purchase the property for the purpose of providing affordable housing. The inspector or city clerk shall certify the mailing of the notices, and the certification shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. Only an organization that has filed a written request for such notices may raise the issue of failure to mail such notices, and the sole remedy shall be an order requiring the inspector to wait forty-five (45) days before causing removal or demolition. The order shall require the owner, within a reasonable time fixed by the inspector, but not less than thirty (30) days nor more than ninety (90) days, to make such repairs, alterations or improvements necessary to correct existing violations of the minimum standards and requirements set forth in this chapter; provided that the order shall further state that if the owner does not make the necessary repairs to correct existing violations as specified in the order, the owner shall, within the same reasonable time period, either: 
(1)  Repair, alter or improve the building, if the repair, alteration or improvement ordered would cost less than fifty (50) percent of the present value of the building; or 
(2)  Demolish the building if the repair, alteration or improvement ordered would cost an amount equal to or in excess of fifty (50) percent of the present value of the building. 
    However, whenever a dwelling is located in a designated historic district of the city and the historic district commission in a public hearing has determined that the dwelling is of a particular significance or value toward maintaining the character of the district, and the dwelling has not been declared as unsafe, the inspector or minimum housing standards commission may issue an order that the dwelling be vacated and closed consistent with G.S. § 160A-400.14(a). 
    If, within the time fixed by the inspector for repairing, altering or improving such building, the inspector finds there has been substantial compliance with the provisions of the order or that the owner has filed with the inspector a written request for additional time to make repairs and provides written documentation for the need of additional time, the inspector may extend the time for compliance with the provisions for the order for an additional period of time; however the total time given by an inspector, including all extensions, shall not exceed ninety (90) days. Requests for additional time to comply under the order may be granted if a written request stating the reasons for the extension, including any written supporting documentation, is made to the director of the department of neighborhood development or his/her designee during the initial period or any extension period granted by the inspector. The grant of any extensions, either by an inspector or by the director of the department of neighborhood development or his/her designee shall be in writing and must state the cause and conditions of the extension and the amount of time allowed by the extension. 
    Exception: The requirement to submit a written request for an extension of time to the department director will be waived if the property owner has submitted an application for assistance for any of the housing rehabilitation programs administered by the neighborhood development department's division of housing services or other approved housing rehabilitation programs and is waiting for either approval of the application or the required repairs to be completed. 
(c)  If the owner of a building fails to comply with order to repair, alter or improve the building, the inspector may cause such building to be repaired, altered or improved, or to be demolished; provided, that after the building has become vacant, the inspector may cause the water service to said building to be discontinued until such time as there is compliance with the order. The inspector shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of any building so closed a placard with the following words: 
"This building is unfit for human habitation; the use of occupancy of this building for human habitation is prohibited and unlawful." 
(d)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or, upon his failure to do so, otherwise demolish the building, the inspector may cause such building to be demolished; provided, that the duties of the inspector with respect to causing the repair, alteration, improvement or demolition set forth in subsections (c) and (d) shall not be exercised until the minimum housing standards commission shall by ordinance or other decree order the inspector to proceed to effectuate the purposes of this chapter concerning the particular property or properties which the inspector shall have found to be unfit for human habitation or dangerous, and which property or properties shall be described in the ordinance or other decree. Such decree shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of Guilford County. Unless an appeal is filed with the housing commission in accordance with applicable provisions of law, the inspector shall proceed to vacate and close any such building and cause the discontinuance of water service to the vacant building without further action by the minimum housing standards commission. 
(e)  The amount of the cost of such repairs, alterations, improvements, and demolition by the inspector shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred; said lien shall be filed, have the same priority and be collected or foreclosed upon in the same manner as is provided for assessments for local improvements. The property owner shall have the option of paying for the cost of demolition either in cash or in five (5) equal annual installments with such installments bearing interest at the rate of six (6) percent per annum from the date of the filing of the lien. If any cost is not paid in cash, the first installment, with interest, shall become due and payable thirty (30) days after the date of the filing of the lien, and one (1) subsequent installment and interest shall be due and payable on the same day of the month in each successive year until the cost is paid in full. If any installment with interest is not paid when due, it shall be subject to the same penalties as are now prescribed by law for unpaid assessments, in addition to the interest herein provided for, and, in addition, all of the installments remaining unpaid shall at once become due and payable and the property may be sold in the same manner as now prescribed by law for the sale of land for unpaid taxes. The whole cost of the demolition may be paid at the time of paying any installment by payment of the principal and all interest accrued to that date. All payments received under this section shall be used by the city for implementation of this chapter, including future repairs, alterations, improvements and demolition of other properties. 
    If the building is demolished by the inspector, he shall sell the materials of such building and any personal property, fixtures or appurtenances found in or attached to the dwelling and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of demolition, and any balance shall be deposited in the superior court of the county by the inspector, to be secured in such manner as may be directed by such court and disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree by such court. If the city contracts for demolition, the contractor shall verify by affidavit that the proceeds from the sale of any salvaged materials, including personal property, fixtures or appurtenances, have been credited against the cost of demolition. 
(f)  Failure on the part of any owner or party in interest to receive or have served upon him any complaint, notice, or order herein provided for shall not affect or invalidate the proceedings with respect to any other owner or party in interest or any other person. 
(g)  For the purposes of fixing the value of dwellings, when a building containing multifamily residential structures is inspected pursuant to this chapter, the inspector shall fix a reasonable value of the total building rather than individual dwelling units contained within any such building. The value of the total building shall be used in determining whether the building should be repaired, altered or improved, or demolished and removed. The inspector may fix a reasonable value of any building for the purpose of this section and such value shall be binding, unless the owner protests such value in writing to the inspector within ten (10) days after receipt of an order. 
(h)  Whenever the minimum housing standards commission shall have adopted an ordinance or other decree or the inspector shall have commenced proceedings under the housing code regarding a dwelling to be repaired or demolished, and the owner has failed to cause such dwelling to be repaired or demolished; provided, the minimum housing standards commission shall first find that the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter or improve the dwelling in order to render it fit for human habitation and that the continuation of the dwelling in its (dilapidated) status would be inimical to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the municipality in that the dwelling would continue to deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities, would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in the area, and would render unavailable property and a dwelling which might otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent and affordable housing in this state. All ordinances or decrees shall be in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws. 
    In such circumstances, the minimum housing standards commission may enact an ordinance or other decree and serve such order upon the owner, requiring that the owner either: 
(1)  Repair the dwelling within ninety (90) days, if the repair necessary to render the dwelling fit for human habitation would cost less than fifty (50) percent of the present value of the dwelling; or 
(2)  Demolish and remove the dwelling within ninety (90) days if the repair necessary to render the dwelling fit for human habitation would cost an amount in excess of fifty (50) percent of the present value of the dwelling. 
    Such order shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of Guilford County and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. If the owner fails to comply with the order of the Greensboro Minimum Housing Standards Commission within the time fixed by such order, then the inspector may effectuate the purpose of the ordinance by causing such dwelling to be demolished and removed. The cost of such demolition and removal shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
    The inspector in proceeding to effectuate the purposes of this section shall follow the requirements of subsection 11-39(e). The inspector shall not proceed to repair or demolish property or properties in accordance with this section until the minimum housing standards commission shall by ordinance or other decree order the inspector to proceed to effectuate the purposes of this section concerning a particular property or properties. 
(i)  The complaint and notice issued pursuant to subsection (a) or the orders issued pursuant to subsection (b) and (h) may be filed in the notice of lis pendens in the office of the clerk of superior court of the county, or the office of the clerk of superior court where the property is otherwise located. From the time and date of recording of such complaint and notice or order, it shall be notice to and binding upon the successors in interest or assigns of the owner of the building or accessory structure. At such time as the residential building or accessory structure affected by the complaint or order is either demolished or brought into compliance with the then existing effective ordinances the inspector may cancel the notice of lis pendens. 
(j)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair or limit the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings, or otherwise.

Sec. 11-39.1. - Requirements for closing and securing substandard buildings. 
(a)  Every building required to be closed by order of the inspector or minimum housing standards commission pursuant to section 11-39 or 17-29 of this Code shall be closed in accordance with the standards and requirements for closing buildings as stated in the International Property Maintenance Code, Appendix A. Any deviation from the standards stated in Appendix A must be approved by the director of the department of neighborhood development or the designee. 
(b)  Any building closed pursuant to an order of the inspector or minimum housing standards commission must be maintained closed and secure by the owner. If the order of the inspector or minimum housing standards commission to close and secure a building is complied with by the owner thereof and thereafter the building is unlawfully opened, the inspector shall serve the owner with an order to reclose and secure the building within thirty (30) days after service of the order. Any owner who fails to comply with an order to reclose and secure a building within the time required under the order shall be subject to civil penalties prescribed by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 91-137, § 3, 11-14-91; Ord. No. 13-104, § 1, 7-16-13; Ord. No. 15-0110, § 1, 9-1-15) 
Sec. 11-40. - Periodic inspections for hazardous or unlawful conditions. 
(a)  The inspection department may make periodic inspections, subject to the council's directions, for unsafe, unsanitary, or otherwise hazardous and unlawful conditions in buildings or structures within its territorial jurisdiction. However, when the inspection department determines that a safety hazard exists in one of the dwelling units within a multifamily building, which in the opinion of the inspector poses an immediate threat to the occupant, the inspection department may inspect, in the absence of a specific complaint and actual knowledge of the unsafe condition, additional dwelling units in the multifamily building to determine if the same safety hazard exists. The inspection department may make periodic inspections only when there is reasonable cause to believe that unsafe, unsanitary, or otherwise hazardous or unlawful conditions may exist in a residential building or structure. For purposes of this section, the term "reasonable cause" means any of the following: (i) the property has a history of more than four verified violations of the housing ordinances or codes within a rolling twelve-month period; (ii) there has been a complaint that substandard conditions exist within the building or there has been a request that the building be inspected; (iii) the inspection department has actual knowledge of an unsafe condition within the building; (iv) violations of the local ordinances or codes are visible from the outside of the property. In conducting inspections authorized under this section, the inspection department shall not discriminate between single-family and multifamily buildings or between owner-occupied and tenant-occupied buildings. In exercising this power, members of the department shall have a right to enter on any premises within the jurisdiction of the department at all reasonable hours for the purposes of inspections or other enforcement action, upon presentation of proper credentials. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit periodic inspections in accordance with state fire prevention code or as otherwise required by state law. 
(b)  [Reserved] 
(c)  The city may not (i) require any owner or manager of rental property to obtain any permit or permission from the city to lease or rent residential real property or to register rental property with the city, except for those individual rental units that have either more than four verified violations in a rolling twelve-month period or two (2) or more verified violations in a rolling thirty-day period; (ii) require that an owner or manager of residential rental property enroll or participate in any governmental program as a condition of obtaining a certificate of occupancy; (iii) levy a special fee or tax on residential rental property that is not also levied against other commercial and residential properties, unless expressly authorized by general law or applicable only to an individual rental unit or property described in subdivision (i) of this subsection and the fee does not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) in any twelve-month period in which the unit or property is found to have verified violations; (iv) provide that any violation of a rental registration ordinance is punishable as a criminal offense; or (v) require any owner or manager of rental property to submit to an inspection before receiving any utility service provided by the city. For purposes of this section, the term "verified violation" means all of the following: 
(1)  The aggregate of all violations of housing ordinances or codes found in an individual rental unit of residential real property during a seventy-two-hour period. 
(2)  Any violations that have not been corrected by the owner or manager within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of written notice from the city of the violation. Should the same violation occur more than two times in a twelve-month period, the owner or manager may not have the option of correcting the violation. If the housing ordinance or code provides that any form of prohibited tenant behavior constitutes a violation by the owner or manager of the rental property, it shall be deemed a correction of the tenant-related violation if the owner or manager, within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice of the tenant-related violation, brings a summary ejectment action to have the tenant evicted. 
(d)  If the city takes action against an individual rental unit under this section, the owner of the individual rental unit may appeal the decision to the minimum housing standards commission. The commission shall fix a reasonable time for hearing appeals, shall give due notice to the owner of the individual rental unit, and shall render a decision within a reasonable time. The commission may reverse or affirm the action, wholly or partly, or may modify the action appealed from, and may make any decision and order that in the opinion of the commission ought to be made in the matter.

Sec. 11-41. - Emergency cases. 
(a)  In emergency cases where it reasonably appears there is immediate danger to the life or safety of any person or to the safety of other property, unless a dwelling unit unfit for human habitation or a dangerous accessory structure is immediately repaired or demolished, the inspector shall order the structure vacated and cause the immediate repair or demolition of the structure and the cost of such repair or demolition shall be recovered and collected as is provided in section 11-39, subsection (e). 
(b)  In emergency cases, the inspector shall have the power immediately to cause to be posted on the main entrance of any building or dwelling unit a placard with words which, in effect, provide notice that the building or dwelling unit has been declared as unsafe and that occupancy for human habitation is prohibited, and further setting forth the reasons therefore.

Sec. 11-42. - Fines, fees and penalties for violation of the housing code. 
(a)  Violations of this chapter shall not be punishable as a misdemeanor or infraction and G.S. § 14-4 shall not apply to violations of this chapter. This section shall apply to all civil penalties assessed on or after January 1, 2014. 
(b)  Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall also be subject to a civil penalty of two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the first violation. For each day the violation is not corrected, a penalty of ten dollars ($10.00) per day may be imposed. Civil penalties assessed under this section are considered restorative; intended to provide compensation to the city for costs associated with the city's program to monitor, control, prosecute, cure and/or correct the violation. As such, the amount declared herein is presumed to provide sufficient restoration to the city for its costs. 
    The assessment of civil penalties herein is not intended to be an exercise of powers delegated to other agencies or entities created by the general assembly to regulate the proscribed conduct. The inspector shall not assess a civil penalty until the person alleged to be in violation has been notified of the violation by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, by personal service, or other means reasonably calculated to give actual notice. The collection of a penalty pursuant hereto shall not foreclose further proceedings for penalties coming due after the date of the filing of a prior proceeding. 
    After a unit has been brought into compliance, the total amount of civil penalties issued may be waived or reduced by the director of neighborhood development department or designee or by the city attorney in accordance with a civil penalty waiver or reduction policy to be adopted by the department of neighborhood development. Modification of penalties by the director, the designee, or the city attorney may be appealed to the commission in accordance with section 11-49. 
(c)  Reinspection fees required by this chapter are charged in accordance with the city's schedule of fees and services established by the Greensboro City Council. The City of Greensboro shall not charge a fee for reinspection authorized by section 11-42 of the Greensboro Code of Ordinances for any initial inspection of a dwelling unit or for any reinspection during the applicable cure period, including any extension, in the enforcement of this chapter. If the necessary repairs are not made within the applicable cure period, including any extension, the reinspection fees authorized by section 11-42 shall be charged. 
(d)  All civil penalties and inspection fees collected under this chapter shall be used for implementation of this chapter, including future repairs, alterations, improvements and demolition of other properties. 
(e)  Owners shall not be charged for any violations attributed to tenants cited in section 11-9 of this chapter of the Greensboro Code of Ordinances.

DIVISION 2. - NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES 

Sec. 11-43. - Enforcement and abatement procedure. 
(a)  As authorized by G.S. ch. 160A, art. 19, pt. 5, the provisions of this section shall apply to all non-residential buildings and structures within the city limits as now or hereinafter fixed. 
(b)  Unless otherwise provided herein, all procedural requirements and violation provisions of article II division 1 of this chapter shall also apply to non-residential buildings and structures. Notice provided under one (1) division shall constitute notice required under any division of this chapter. 
(c)  The purpose of this section is to arrest, remedy, and prevent the decay and deterioration of non-residential buildings and structures for the protection of life, health, welfare, safety and property of the general public and the owners and occupants of non-residential buildings and structures. 
(d)  It shall be the duty of the inspector diligently to examine non-residential buildings and structures located in the city where the conditions described in subsection (e) exist for the purpose of locating and taking action with respect to such non-residential buildings and structures as appear to be unsafe. 
(e)  An inspector may declare a non-residential building or structure to be unsafe if it appears to the inspector that the building or structure is especially dangerous to life because of its liability to fire or because of bad conditions of walls, overloaded floors, defective construction, decay, unsafe wiring or heating system, inadequate means of egress or other causes. 
(f)  After an inspector declares a non-residential building or structure unsafe in accordance with subsection (e), the inspector must affix a notice of the unsafe character of the non-residential building or structure in a conspicuous place upon the exterior of the building or structure. If any person shall remove any notice that has been affixed to any building or structure by the inspector, that person shall be guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor. If the owner of the non-residential building or structure that has been declared to be unsafe pursuant to this chapter shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the inspector shall give the owner written notice, by certified or registered mail to his last known address or by personal service that: 
(1)  The non-residential building or structure is in a condition that appears to meet one of the following conditions: 
a.  Constitutes a fire or safety hazard; 
b.  Is dangerous to life, health, or other property; 
c.  Is likely to cause or contribute to blight, disease, vagrancy, or danger to children; 
d.  Has a tendency to attract persons intent on criminal activities or other activities which would constitute a public nuisance. 
(2)  That a hearing will be held before the inspector at a designated place and time, not later than ten (10) days after the date of the notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or through counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and 
(3)  That following the hearing, the inspector may issue such order to repair, close, vacate, or demolish the building or structure as appears appropriate within a period not less than sixty (60) days from the date of the order. However where the inspector finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser period of time as may be feasible. 
(g)  If the name or whereabouts of the owner cannot after due diligence be discovered, the notice shall be considered properly and adequately served if a copy thereof is posted on the outside of the building or structure in question at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing and a notice of the hearing is published in a newspaper having general circulation in the city at least once not later than one (1) week prior to the hearing. 
(h)  Any owner who has received an order under this chapter may appeal from the order to the minimum housing standards commission by giving written notice to the inspector and to the commission within ten (10) days following the issuance of the order. In the absence of an appeal the order of the inspector shall be final. 
(i)  If an owner shall fail to comply with an order issued pursuant to subsection 11-43(f) from which no appeal has been taken, or fails to comply with an order from the housing commission following an appeal, the city may, in addition to any other remedy provided by law or equity, take action causing the non-residential building or structure to be removed or demolished. The amounts incurred in connection with the removal or demolition shall be a lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred. The lien shall be filed, have the same priority, and be collected in the same manner as liens for special assessments. All payments received under this section shall be used for the implementation of this chapter, including future repairs, alterations, improvements and demolition of other properties. 
    If the building or structure is removed or demolished by the city, the city shall sell usable materials of the building and any personal property, fixtures, or appurtenances found in or attached to the building and credit the proceeds of such sales against the costs of removal or demolition. Any balance remaining, if any, shall be deposited with the Guilford County Clerk of Superior Court and shall be disbursed by the court to the person found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of the court. If the city contracts for demolition, the contractor shall verify by affidavit that the proceeds from the sale of any salvaged materials, including personal property, fixtures or appurtenances, have been credited against the cost of demolition. 
(j)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair or limit the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings, or otherwise.

(d)  The commission shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals and shall render its decisions within a reasonable time. The commission shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the housing code, to adapt the application of the code to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the code shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.

(b)  If within sixty (60) days after a complaint is filed, the human relations director is unable to effectuate a voluntary resolution of a complaint where a reasonable cause is determined, he shall so advise the complainant and respondent immediately in writing by certified or registered letter. Upon written appeal of the respondent filed with the human relations director within ten (10) days after the respondent receives the above-mentioned letter, the specific case involved shall be referred to the complaint review committee for final administrative review, determination and any further conciliatory efforts, if advisable. In addition, the human relations director may, upon his own initiative and within said ten-day period, refer the specific case to the complaint review committee for final administrative review, determination and any further conciliatory efforts, if advisable. When any such case has been referred, if the complaint review committee either finds no reasonable cause or, upon finding reasonable cause, is unable to obtain a voluntary conciliation and resolve within thirty (30) days after referral, the complainant and respondent shall be immediately notified in writing.

ARTICLE VI. - MISCELLANEOUS COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY: COMMERCIAL STREET PERFORMERS, ETC. 

Sec. 13-206. - Commercial street performers. 
(a)  Definitions. As used in this section, "perform" or "performance" for commercial purposes, not charitable purposes, means audible or visual entertainment such as, but not limited to, reciting or singing, acting, dancing, miming, pantomiming, playing a musical instrument or performing a theatrical or literary work. "Street performer" means an individual or a group who performs on public property within the City of Greensboro. 
(b)  Intent and purpose. The Greensboro City Council finds and determines the following: 
(1)  Street performances are distinguished from panhandling activities by the commercial nature of the performer's actions which provide the benefit of a live performance of artistic value in exchange for gratuities given in appreciation of the performance. Therefore, the nature and character of a street performance differs from solicitation of a charitable contribution. 
(2)  Street performers are engaged in commerce as professional entertainers whose livelihood comes, wholly or in part, from gratuities received in exchange for the artistic value of the performance. Regulation of the commercial performances of street performers would enhance the character and culture of the City of Greensboro. 
(3)  Street performers have a right to perform on public property, but unregulated street performances are also likely to cause adverse impacts to the community such as: gathering crowds attracted to the entertainment offered in public locations not appropriate for street performances because of insufficient room for crowds; blocked sidewalks; blocked ingress and egress of buildings; the risk of disrupting nearby motor vehicle traffic; interference with the operation of commercial activities; and disturbance of the quiet enjoyment of residents. 
(4)  G.S. § 160A-178 authorizes a city to enact an ordinance that regulates, restricts or prohibits the business activities of itinerant merchants, salespersons, promoters, drummers, peddlers, or hawkers. G.S. § 160A-174 authorizes a city to enact an ordinance that defines, prohibits, regulates or abates acts, omissions, or conditions detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of its citizens and the peace and dignity of the city. G.S. § 160A-296(5) gives a city the power to regulate the use of public sidewalks and public streets. 
(5)  For these reasons, it is the intent of the Greensboro City Council to permit street performances subject to careful regulation in order to reduce or eliminate adverse impacts associated with unregulated or poorly regulated street performances. The purpose of this ordinance is to create a means of regulation which ensures the ability of street performers to perform in public spaces and to promote harmony among street performers, local businesses, permitted event sponsors, residents, and visitors of Greensboro by balancing the interests of performing artists with Greensboro citizens through the careful regulation of street performances. 
(c)  Regulations. Street performers shall comply with the following regulations: 
(1)  Street performers shall not unreasonably block, or cause the unreasonable blocking of any sidewalk, passageway, street, or any ingress or egress to any building, structure, driveway or other passage. 
(2)  Street performers shall not perform on private property without written permission of the property owner. Street performers are required to keep the writing granting such permission on their person during any performance on private property. 
(3)  No street performer shall make any use in any way of fire, sharp instruments or objects, spray paint, aerosols, firearms (real or simulated), dangerous weapons or any form of harmful chemicals during a street performance. 
(4)  Street performers shall stay at least seventy-five (75) feet away from other street performers and twenty-five (25) feet from outdoor seating or dining areas. If a citation is issued for violating the seventy-five foot separation, the citation shall be issued to the performer arriving second-in-time. 
(5)  Street performers shall not commit any violation of chapter 18, article IV, offenses of unreasonable or disturbing sound. A violation of chapter 18, article IV shall not be punishable under this article, but a law enforcement officer may instruct a street performer to cease the chapter 18, article IV violation. 
(6)  While conducting a street performance, street performers shall not use language or gesture, or display any matter which: 
a.  Is obscene as prohibited by G.S. § 14-190.1; 
b.  Incites or urges riot as prohibited by G.S. § 14-288.2; 
c.  A violation of G.S. § 14-190.1 or G.S. § 14-288.2 shall not be punishable under this article, but a law enforcement officer may instruct a street performer to cease the G.S. § 14-190.1 or G.S. § 14-288.2 violation(s). 
(7)  Street performers shall not remain at one location for a total duration of more than four (4) hours during any one-day period. When a street performer leaves a location, the street performer shall not return to that location for at least one (1) hour. 
(8)  No street performer shall claim a greater right to perform at any location over a street performer who arrives first at the same location. 
(9)  Street performances are not permitted before 10:00 a.m. nor after 11:00 p.m. 
(10)  Signs used by a street performer shall be in a location at least three (3) feet away from any curb and not in any location which impedes any foot traffic, parking or persons entering or exiting any motor vehicle. Street performers shall remove such signs from any location at the conclusion of their performance. No sign, handbill, flyer or other advertisement shall be left at any location after the conclusion of a performance. 
(11)  Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 18, article IV, section 18-50, a street performer or group may use small, portable and self-powered amplification devices for the purpose of conducting a street performance. All street performers will comply with all remaining provisions of chapter 18, article IV of the Greensboro Code of Ordinances. 
(d)  Enforcement and penalty. 
(1)  Any person who fails or refuses to comply with the regulations contained in this article upon request of a city official or law enforcement officer, shall be guilty of a class 3 misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to fifty dollars ($50.00). Except as otherwise provided herein, a law enforcement officer shall issue a citation for a violation of this article. 
(e)  Applicability. The provisions of this article do not apply to any person engaged in a special event as that term is defined in Greensboro Code of Ordinances section 26-247.

Sec. 16-8. - Obstructions to cross-visibility at intersections. 
(a)  In order to promote and conserve the public health and safety and pursuant to the police powers of the city and the power to prevent and abate public nuisances, it is declared to be a public nuisance for any person owning and/or having the legal control of any land within the corporate limits of the city to maintain or permit upon any such land any fence, sign, billboard, mailbox, shrubbery, tree, natural growth, earthen berm, or any other object, or any combination thereof, which obstructs the view of motorists using any street or approach to any street intersection so as to constitute a traffic hazard or a condition dangerous to the public safety. 
(b)  The restrictions set forth in this section shall apply to the plan view of the triangular area bounded by the curb (or edges of pavement where there is no curb) upon the street and a diagonal line joining points to the curb (or edge of pavement where there is no curb); the triangular area shall be defined by projecting the curb or edge of pavement for the abutting streets to an imaginary point of intersection. The base lines for the triangle shall be defined by measuring a minimum distance (as indicated in Table 1 below) along the major (nonstop) street and twenty (20) feet along the minor (stop) street from this point of intersection.

Speed Limit of Major Street 
(in miles per hour) Distance along Major Street 
(in feet) 25 150 30 200 35 250 40 300 45 350 50 400 55 500  
    It shall be noted that the above Table 1 is indicating minimum sight clearance distances. Because of the unusual characteristics in the horizontal and vertical alignments of the roads of Greensboro (with curves and small hills), the distances along the major (nonstop) street will be determined according to the city transportation director or his designee on a case by case situation. 
(c)  Within the triangle, and except as provided in subsection (d) below, it shall be unlawful to install, set out or maintain, or allow the installation, setting out, or maintenance of any fence, sign, billboard, mailbox, shrubbery, tree, natural growth, earthen berm, or any other object of any kind which obstructs cross-visibility at a level between thirty (30) inches and ninety-six (96) inches above the average grade of the adjacent street. 
(d)  The provisions of subsection (c) shall not apply to: 
(1)  Permanent structures (i.e. buildings, bridge railings, retaining walls). 
(2)  Existing natural grades of existing streets which, by reason of natural topography, rise thirty (30) or more inches above the average grade of the adjacent streets. 
(3)  Fire hydrants, public utility poles, street markers, governmental signs, and traffic-control devices. 
(e)  Where compliance with this section in the foregoing described triangles is insufficient to prevent a potentially dangerous condition, the city transportation director may designate further measures which must be taken by the owner or other responsible person to eliminate such potentially dangerous conditions. Such measures shall be designated to provide an adequate sight and stopping distance for persons approaching the intersection at the prevailing speeds and may include the removal of obstructions at different heights or in areas outside the triangle established in subsection (b) above. 
(f)  If the provisions of any other law, ordinance or regulation of the city or of the state shall be in conflict with the provisions of this section, the more stringent provision shall control. 
(g)  The administration of this section shall be under the direction of the city transportation director or his designee who shall investigate violations, issue such notices and orders as are required herein, and perform such other duties as may be necessary to the enforcement hereof. 
(h)  Any obstruction to cross-visibility maintained in violation of this section shall be deemed to be a public nuisance inconsistent with and potentially detrimental to public safety and shall be abated in accordance with the following procedure: 
(1)  Upon the initial inspection of the intersection, the city transportation director or his designee shall leave a sight obstruction notice, identifying the obstruction item(s) to be trimmed or removed within the maximum time requirement of ten (10) days, at the premises upon which such obstruction exists. 
(2)  Following the ten (10) days, if the sight obstruction has not been removed, the city transportation director or his designee shall cause to be served by personal delivery or registered or certified mail a written notice and order of abatement upon the owner, tenant and-or person having legal control of the premises upon which such obstruction exists. A person who cannot with due diligence be served by personal delivery or registered or certified mail may be served by publication in the manner provided for service of process in G.S. 1A1, Rule 4(j1) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. 
(3)  Such obstruction shall be removed within ten (10) days from the date of receipt, or ten (10) days from the date of the returned certified or registered mail stub or affidavit of publication. 
(4)  If compliance with such order by any person is disregarded, the city transportation director or his designee is hereby authorized to enter upon the premises in question and cause the removal and abatement of such obstruction by city services and/or independent contractor. 
(5)  Any person receiving such notice and order may, within ten (10) days from the receipt thereof, request, in writing, a hearing before the city transportation director or his designee. The hearing shall be held not later than ten (10) days following the date of the request. The city manager or the city transportation director shall then fix the date of the hearing and notify the person upon whom the notice and order has been served of the time and place of such meeting. If, after such hearing, the city manager or his designee finds the obstruction in question does in fact, constitute a public nuisance, the city transportation director or his designee may order that such nuisance be abated within ten (10) days from the date of such order. Upon failure by any person to comply with such order of the city manager or his designee, the city transportation director or his designee is hereby authorized to enter upon the premises in question and cause the removal and abatement of such obstruction by city forces and/or independent contractor. 
(6)  If any person receiving a written notice and order from the city transportation director does not comply with the order or does not respond or acknowledge certified mail attempt and does not request, in writing, a hearing before the city manager or his designee within said ten (10) days, the city transportation director or his designee is hereby authorized to enter upon the premises in question and cause the removal and abatement of such obstruction by city forces and/or an independent contractor. 
(7)  Upon the completion of such removal and abatement, the city transportation director or his designee shall deliver to the city tax collector a statement showing the actual cost of the abatement of the unlawful condition plus an additional fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) to cover the cost of notice and the cost of collection. The city tax collector shall thereupon mail to the owner of the subject property a bill covering the cost, if with reasonable diligence the name and address of such owner can be ascertained, and the amount of the bill shall become a lien upon said subject property, and if not paid within (30) days shall be collected as in the manner provided for collection of delinquent taxes. 
(i)  Any person who shall maintain or permit any such public nuisance and who shall fail, refuse or neglect to remove, destroy or otherwise eliminate such condition constituting such public nuisance as hereinbefore defined within the period prescribed by the director of public works (or his designee) or, in the event of an appeal, within the period prescribed by the city manager (or his designee) shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(j)  In addition to the other remedies provided herein, the city shall be entitled to seek a judicial injunction and order of abatement or other equitable remedy to secure the enforcement of this section, regardless of whether the city manager has held or been requested to hold a hearing or the city manager or city council has declared the condition a nuisance. 
(k)  The foregoing procedure does not apply in emergency cases where it reasonably appears there is immediate danger to the life or safety of any person or to the safety of other property. In emergency cases, the city transportation director or his/her designee shall have the authority to immediately remove such obstruction and the cost of such removal shall be assessed against the property owner. Prior to taking the action, the city transportation director or his designee shall place a notice of the condition which constitutes a dangerous obstruction on the property giving the property owner two (2) days to remove the obstruction prior to the city's taking action.

The notice shall explain the procedure by which the owner or the person in charge may assert his right to a hearing to determine the propriety of the impoundment and the responsibility for costs incident to impoundment prior to the payment of any costs, lien or fine assessed. If a hearing is not requested within ten (10) days after receipt of notice, the right to a hearing shall be deemed to have been waived. 
(g)  Law enforcement officers of the city or other city officials designated by the chief of police shall tow or cause to be towed vehicles that the owner/driver require immediate towing services because of traffic safety issues.

This authority shall be in addition to any other authority the traffic engineer may have to regulate the times and conditions of motor vehicle parking on public streets. 
(b)  In order to determine whether a particular area should be designated as a controlled parking residential area, the traffic engineer may conduct, upon his own initiative or upon a petition of a majority of the households in such proposed area, addressed to the city manager, a study to determine if the proposed area meets the criteria set forth above. Following the study, and upon approval of the city manager, the traffic engineer shall determine whether to designate the proposed area under consideration as a controlled parking residential area or to remove the designation in the case of a previously established controlled parking residential area. Following the approval by the city manager of the designation of a controlled parking residential area, the traffic engineer shall cause the regulation to be recorded upon the official traffic records and retained permanently in the office of the city clerk. In addition, the traffic engineer shall cause parking signs to be erected upon public streets in the area, indicating the times, locations and conditions upon which parking shall be by permit only.

In order to qualify for a new controlled residential parking area under this section, the following conditions must exist: 
a.  The new development is projected to generate more than one thousand five hundred (1,500) daily vehicle trips as identified by an approved transportation impact study; 
b.  The new development is within one-half (1/2) mile of an existing controlled parking residential area; and

Sec. 17-26. - Declaration and findings. 
    The city council finds and declares that there exists in the city certain occupied and vacant buildings and other nonresidential structures that constitute a health or safety hazard or both to the citizens of the city as a result of conditions creating a fire hazard, bad condition of walls, over-loaded floors, defective construction, decay, unsafe wiring or heating system, inadequate means of egress, dangerous conditions creating a threat to children, frequent use by vagrants as living quarters, or the attractions of insects or rodents. In order to alleviate these unsafe and dangerous conditions for the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city, a public necessity exists for the repair, closing or demolishing of such buildings and other nonresidential structures. 
(Code 1961, § 8-28(a))

    If the building inspector finds that the conditions of a building or other nonresidential structure constitutes a fire or safety hazard or is dangerous to life, health or other property and he has notified the owner of these conditions and has also posted the building or nonresidential structure, the owner shall take the necessary measures to correct the unsafe or hazardous conditions found by the building inspector. 
(Code 1961, § 10-28(b)) 
Sec. 17-28. - Appeal.

The determination by the building inspector to close and secure the building or other nonresidential structure upon failure of the owner to comply with the order to repair, improve, vacate, close or demolish, shall not be exercised until the housing commission shall, by resolution, order the building inspector to proceed to cause the building or other nonresidential structure to be closed and secured and the resolution shall describe the location of the property. 
(b)  If the inspector finds a building or structure that is in such a state of disrepair and dilapidation that unless such structure or building is immediately repaired or demolished it would continue to constitute a health or safety hazard and will continue to be dangerous to life, health or other property based upon the standards set forth in subsection (c), he shall order the owner thereof to demolish the structure or to immediately repair it in such a manner that it meets the minimum requirements of the building code. The owner of the building or structure may appeal the order to repair or demolish by appealing to the housing commission as provided in section 17-28. If the owner fails to repair or demolish the structure as required in the order of the building inspector after the inspector has followed the procedures as prescribed by North Carolina General Statutes sections 160A-425 through 160A-430, then the building inspector may cause the structure to be demolished. 
(c)  Hazardous conditions requiring immediate repair or demolition shall be met if the building inspector finds all of the following: 
(1)  The condition of the walls, floor and roof is in such a state of decay or disrepair that they constitute a serious safety hazard. 
(2)  The cost of repair to bring the building or structure into compliance with the minimum building code of the city would be sixty-five (65) percent or more of the value of the building or structure as it stands at the time of the inspection. The building inspector may use his own opinion to find that the cost of repair of the building or structure would be sixty-five (65) percent of the value of the structure. 
(d)  No building or structure shall be caused to be demolished by the building inspector until the minimum housing standards commission shall, by ordinance or other decree, order the building inspector to proceed to cause the building or structure to be demolished and the ordinance or other decree shall describe the location of the property.

Sec. 18-46.1. - Solicitation and distribution of items in public parking garages and public parking lots prohibited. 
(a)  Solicitation permitted. Solicitation, where not otherwise prohibited herein or by State law, is allowed in the public spaces of Greensboro. 
(b)  Purpose and intent. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city through the proper management of the city's municipally owned parking garages and parking lots. The city is authorized to operate a parking enterprise to furnish parking services to the city and its citizens. 
(1)  The city council finds that municipal owned or operated parking garages and parking lots are not traditional public forums for First Amendment purposes and that the city may regulate conduct and use of the parking garages and parking lots through adequate and reasonable rules. The statutory authority is found in G.S. 160A-174 and 160A-312. 
(2)  The city finds it necessary to restrict certain activities, including solicitation and distribution within public parking garages and parking lots because of the increased potential for accidents in parking garages and parking lots, limited space for individuals walking to vehicles and engaging in transactions associated with solicitation and distribution, and due to the potential for individuals accessing their cars to feel a heightened level of intimidation when approached by a solicitor or distributor. 
(c)  Definitions. The following words, terms, and phrases when used in this section shall have the meanings set forth in this subsection, unless the context of their usage clearly indicates another meaning: 
(1)  Public Parking Garage and Parking Lot means lots, garages, or portions of lots or garages, owned or operated by the City of Greensboro which have the sole purpose of providing vehicular parking. On-street parking, including diagonal on-street parking, is not considered a garages or lot. The word "deck" has the same meaning as the word "garage." 
(2)  Enter or entry. For the purpose of this section, entry into a parking garage or parking lot shall mean entry onto the paved parking portion where it's the sole intended purpose is the parking of vehicles. 
(d)  Offense. It shall be unlawful to: 
(1)  Enter a public parking garage or parking lot for the purpose of soliciting for or distributing within the parking garage or parking lot any of the following: money, contributions, signatures, leaflets, or pamphlets for any purpose or use; and 
(2)  Engage in the intended solicitation or distribution. 
(e)  Exemption for sidewalks and landscaped areas through and adjacent to parking garages and parking lots. The prohibition under this subsection does not restrict solicitation or distributions on public sidewalks or landscaped areas that run through or immediately adjacent to a public parking garage or lot where such sidewalk or landscaped area is a path for movement other than for the purpose of getting to and from a vehicle in the parking garage. However, any solicitation along such sidewalk or landscaped area shall be confined to the sidewalk or landscaped area, and no solicitor or distributor shall follow physically an individual off the sidewalk or landscaped area and through the publicly owned parking garage or parking lot where the individual has declined the solicitation or distribution. 
(1)  This subsection is further clarified below, through example, as it applies to the public parking lots located at Elm St. and McGee St. and Elm St. and Greene St. (referred to as the "Elm Street Lots"). This clarification applies in the same manner to all parking lots and parking garages with the same or similar features: 
i.  The Elm Street Lots are comprised of paved parking areas immediately adjacent to two (2) commercial buildings, surrounded by sidewalks providing access to the street (the "surrounding sidewalks"), and with one large sidewalk running directly through the middle of the paved parking areas such that parking is allowed on either side of that middle sidewalk (the "middle sidewalk"). Many pedestrians, including those parking a vehicle, use the middle sidewalk. The prohibition in this subsection shall not apply to any individual using the middle sidewalk or the surrounding sidewalks, even where the individual is soliciting or distributing to a person who is standing on the paved portion of the Elm Street Lots. The prohibition in this subsection does apply if the individual soliciting or distributing leaves the surrounding sidewalk or middle sidewalk, enters into the paved parking area with the intent to continue soliciting or distributing, and either engages in the soliciting or distributing or continues to engage in the soliciting or distributing when the individual being engaged has declined the solicitation or distribution. This prohibition is intended to prevent persons who have declined the solicitation or distribution from being followed from the sidewalk to their vehicles or from being approached and engaged in the paved parking areas while accessing their vehicles. 
(f)  Designation of public parking garage and parking lots. Public parking garage and parking lots shall be designated by clearly posted signs. The city shall maintain and provide upon request a list of public parking garages and parking lots, currently titled "Traffic Schedule 9, Public Off-Street Parking Lots." 
(g)  Other solicitation prohibited by state law. This section shall not apply to any type of solicitation or distribution regulated, prohibited, or punishable under other applicable state law. 
(h)  Exceptions. This section shall not apply to any parking garage or parking lot adjacent to or used as the designed parking for a polling place during the time when city owned property is used by the Guilford County Board of Election as a polling place. This section also shall not apply when an event is taking place within the public parking garage or parking lot due to a permit granted by the city. 
(i)  Penalty. A violation of this section shall be a class 3 misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to fifty dollars ($50.00). 
(Ord. No. 18-102, § 3, 8-14-18) 
Sec. 18-46.2. - Harassment in public spaces prohibited. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. 
(1)  The city is enabled, pursuant to G.S. 160A-174, to protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and to ensure the peace and dignity of the city. It is the intent of council in enacting this ordinance to recognize the rights of all citizens while at the same time protecting the coexistent rights for all citizens to enjoy safe and convenient travel in public spaces free from harassment. In the course of public hearings and debates regarding solicitation and safety in public spaces in Greensboro, the city recognizes that the dangerous effects of harassment may occur in the commission of or completely separate from an act of solicitation, where such conduct occurs in public spaces and includes following a person or cornering a person for the purpose of intimidating that person. 
(2)  The current state laws on stalking and harassment do not protect individuals who are harassed in public spaces where such harassment is confined to a single occasion but is also dangerous or intimidating. Such harassment causes intimidation and fear and may result in an interaction with dangerous or violent consequences. Free and safe passage on city sidewalks and streets is necessary. Therefore, the following ordinance intends to address harassment on sidewalks and streets by penalizing the following conduct. 
(b)  Definitions. The following definitions apply in this section: 
(1)  Public space means streets, sidewalks, alleys, and other public property, as well as city-owned and city-controlled property. 
(2)  Reasonable person means a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances. 
(c)  Offense. A person is guilty of harassment in a public space if the person: 
(1)  Knowingly and intentionally performs either of the following with no legitimate purpose: 
i.  Following an individual in or about a public space with the intent of threatening, intimidating, or causing fear for personal safety; or 
ii.  Surrounding an individual or intentionally and physically directing the individual's movement through or in a public space with the intent of threatening, intimidating, or causing fear for personal safety. This subsection includes crowding or cornering an individual with the intent of threatening, intimidating, or causing fear for personal safety and without that individual's consent as the individual is actively engaging or attempting to use an automated teller machine or parking meter and the individual must stand within the public space to access the automated teller machine or parking meter; 
(2)  The conduct described in subsection (c)(1)(i) or (ii) is directed at an individual in the individual's presence; and 
(3)  The person continues the conduct described in subsection (c)(1)(i) or (ii) after the individual to whom the conduct is directed has made a negative verbal response or taken action that a reasonable person would understand as a negative response. 
(d)  Penalty. A violation of this section shall be a class 3 misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to fifty dollars ($50.00).

(2)  Prior convictions, if any, of any person, owner, or of anyone in control of the object, for violation of the federal or state controlled substances acts. 
(3)  The proximity of the drug stem, in time and space, to a controlled substance. 
(4)  The existence of any residue of a controlled substance on the drug stem.

(e)  Defense. It is a defense to a violation of this section that the drug stem is primarily designed and used for a legitimate purpose unrelated to the ingestion of a controlled substance into the human body. 
(f)  Enforcement. The enforcement to this section is vested in the Greensboro Police Department. 
(g)  Penalty; additional remedies. The penalty and remedies for violation of this section shall be as follows: 
(1)  Civil penalty; injunctive relief. Any person who violates any subsection of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each violation or injunctive relief to restrain the person from continuing the violation or threat of violation, or both injunctive relief and a civil penalty. Upon application for injunctive relief and a finding that a person is violating or threatening to violate any subsection of this section, the superior court shall grant injunctive relief to restrain the violation.

Sec. 18-52. - Measurement of sound. 
(a)  Measurement of sound. For the purpose of determining dB(C) as referred to in this Code, the noise shall be measured on the C-weighting scale on a sound level meter of standard design and quality having characteristics established by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). 
(b)  Measurement techniques. Measurement of sound shall be made according to these standards: 
(1)  Sound measurements shall be conducted at that time of day or night when the suspect noise source is emitting sound. 
(2)  The sound level measurement shall be determined as follows: 
a.  Set the sound level meter on the "C" weighted filter at slow response. 
b.  Where possible the measurement should be made with clear view to the source of the sound. 
c.  All measurements shall be taken at or within the nearest residential property line occupied by the complainant, unless otherwise stated in the Code. For multifamily structures, including apartments, condominiums, or other residential arrangements where boundary lines cannot readily be determined or do not exist, measurements shall be taken from any point abutting the exterior of the complainant's residential unit. 
(3)  Measurements recorded shall be taken so as to provide a proper representative of the noise being measured. The microphone shall be positioned facing the noise source and so as not to create any unnatural enhancement or diminution of the measured noise. A windscreen for the microphone shall be used. Using the C-weighting and slow response switch settings, the operator takes four (4) consecutive readings of thirty (30) seconds each. Any decibel reading which exceeds the allowed decibel limits is a violation of this article. 
(c)  Training of personnel. The operator of a sound level meter, but not persons assisting the operator with non-technical aspects of sound level measurement, must have received special training in sound measurement from an expert, or experts, in sound measurement and must have received training in the use of the sound level meter used. The chief of police of the city shall prescribe minimum training standards for such operators. 
(d)  [Enforcement.] In the enforcement of this article, an enforcement officer may be required to exercise judgment in determining if a particular noise is sufficiently loud or otherwise so offensive that it would substantially interfere with persons occupying nearby public or private property. When making such determinations, the enforcement officer may consider the following and other relevant factors: 
(1)  The volume of the noise. 
(2)  The intensity of the noise. 
(3)  Whether the nature of the noise is usual or unusual. 
(4)  Whether the origin of the noise is natural or unnatural. 
(5)  The type and intensity of ambient noise, if any. 
(6)  The nature and zoning of the area in which the noise is heard.

(5)  In this section "paved streets" means streets that are completely paved with curb, gutters and asphaltic or concrete wearing surface. In the event the existing pavement is not complete with curb and gutters, or if the street has curb and gutters and is not completely paved with standard asphaltic or concrete wearing surface, then one-half of the exemption as specified in this section shall apply. 
(6)  In the event that the street alongside of a corner lot, used as a single lot, has sidewalks and sidewalks are constructed on the intersecting street, such lot shall be exempt from assessment for the sidewalks on said intersecting street to the extent of fifty (50) percent of the frontage thereon or thirty (30) feet, whichever is less.

Persons failing to secure such a permit under this article, however, will not be entitled to the benefits provided by this article, including but not limited to, the right to erect stages, barricades, utility poles, booths, tents, or other temporary structures, or the use of amplified devices, parked vehicles or of permanent structures, or to the assistance of city personnel in carrying out their event, or their exclusive or reserved use of the facility unless otherwise authorized by some other ordinance or law.

    The city finds that the development of telecommunications has the potential of having great benefit and impact upon the city. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with telecommunications, the city further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by exercising licensing and regulatory powers which are vested in the city or such persons as the city shall designate. It is the intent of this chapter and subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the best possible public interest and public purpose in these matters and any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof. 
(Ord. No. 95-60, 6-1-95; Ord. No. 10-139, § 1, 9-7-10)

No reference herein, or in any franchise, to the "public rights-of-way or streets" shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the city that its title to any property is sufficient to permit its use for such purpose, and the grantee shall, by its use of such terms, be deemed to gain only such rights to use property in the city as the city may have the undisputed right and power to give. 
    Service related activity means any activity or function associated with the distribution or provision of telecommunications service over the telecommunications system, including without limitation, repair service, use of facilities or converters, billing charges, advertising, installation, disconnects or reconnects of service, collecting bad debts, converters, or sale of merchandise in Greensboro.

ARTICLE II. - FRANCHISE 

Sec. 28.1-4. - Grant of franchise. 
(a)  Grant. Pursuant to the authority of the City Charter and general statutory laws subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the city can grant revocable and non-exclusive franchises, acting pursuant to the state enabling law and the city's applicable Charter provisions, ordinances, rules and regulations to construct and operate a telecommunications system in, under, over, along, across or upon the streets and public rights-of-way within the city for the purpose of reception, transmission, collection, amplification, origination, distribution or redistribution of electronic signals and for the development of telecommunication services in accordance with the laws of the city, the State of North Carolina, and United States of America. In exercising rights pursuant hereto, grantee shall not endanger or interfere with the lives of persons, interfere with any installations of the city, any public utility serving the city or any other person permitted to use the streets and public rights-of-way nor unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the streets and public rights-of-way. The grant of one (1) franchise does not establish priority for use over the other present or future permit or franchise holders or the city's own use of the streets and public rights-of-way. The city shall at all times control the distribution of space in, over, under or across all streets or public rights-of-way occupied by the telecommunications system. 
    No grant of any franchise shall affect the right of the city to grant to any other person a right to occupy or use the streets, or portions thereof, for the construction and operation of a telecommunications system within the city or the right of the city to permit the use of the streets or public rights-of-way of the city for any purpose whatever. By accepting a franchise, the franchisee thereby acknowledges the city's right to make such grants and permit such uses. No privilege or power of eminent domain is bestowed on grantee by the grant of a franchise. 
    Any telecommunications system located in the streets and public rights-of-way on the effective date of this chapter [Ord. No. 95-60, June 28, 1995], shall obtain a franchise from the city, pursuant to section 28.1-9 of this chapter, within one hundred and twenty (120) days, unless such timeframe is extended by the city. 
(b)  General city ordinances. Any franchise granted by the city is hereby made subject to the general chapter provisions now in effect and hereafter made effective. Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the various codes and ordinances of the city regarding permits, taxes, fees to be paid, or manner of construction. 
(Ord. No. 95-60, 6-1-95) 
Sec. 28.1-5. - Franchise area. 
    The franchise area shall be the entire city, or portions thereof, for which a franchise is granted. 
(Ord. No. 95-60, 6-1-95) 
Sec. 28.1-6. - Use of public rights-of-way and streets. 
    For the purpose of operating and maintaining a telecommunications system in the city, the grantee may erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along the public streets and rights-of-way within the city such wires, cables, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are necessary to the operation of the telecommunications system, provided, however, that grantee complies with all design, construction, safety, and performance provisions contained in this chapter, the franchise, and other applicable local chapters. The grantee shall use its best efforts to also obtain pole attachment agreements for use of any utility poles or other utility facilities required in connection with the provision of services, provided such agreements are available upon reasonable terms and conditions. 
(Ord. No. 95-60, 6-1-95) 
Sec. 28.1-7. - Use of grantee facilities. 
    No poles shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval of the city with regard to location, height, type and any other pertinent aspect, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. However, the location of any pole of the grantee shall not be a vested right with respect to the city and such poles shall be removed, relocated or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the city reasonably determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. Grantee shall utilize existing poles and conduits, where practicable. The city shall have the right, during the life of the franchise, to install communications facilities and maintain free of charge upon the poles or other above-ground facilities owned by the grantee. Where the installation of such facilities by the city requires the adjustment of franchisee's facilities on any pole or other above-ground facility (whether owned by franchisee, another company, the city, or another person), such adjustment shall be made by franchisee at a reasonable charge to the city. 
(Ord. No. 95-60, 6-1-95) 
Sec. 28.1-8. - Term of franchise. 
    The term of the franchise shall commence upon execution of the franchise by the city and the grantee and shall continue for a period specified in the franchise, unless sooner terminated as provided herein. Grantee shall have no property right upon the expiration of the franchise term, except as provided by applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 95-60, 6-1-95) 
Sec. 28.1-9. - Franchise required. 
    No telecommunications system shall be allowed to occupy or use the streets and public rights-of-way of the city or be allowed to operate within the city without a franchise. 
(Ord. No. 95-60, 6-1-95) 
Sec. 28.1-10. - Franchise nonexclusive. 
    Grant. Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be nonexclusive. The city specifically reserves the right to (i) grant at any time such additional franchises for a telecommunication system as it deems appropriate, and/or (ii) build, operate, and own such telecommunications system or systems as it deems appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 95-60, 6-1-95) 
Sec. 28.1-11. - Police and regulatory powers reserved. 
    Grantee shall comply with all generally applicable laws, chapters and regulations enacted by the city pursuant to its police powers. Any conflict between the terms of this chapter or the franchise and any present or future lawful exercise of the city's police powers shall be resolved in favor of police powers. 
(Ord. No. 95-60, 6-1-95) 
Sec. 28.1-12. - City's right to perform public works. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be in hindrance to the right of the city or any governmental authority to perform or carry on, directly or indirectly, any public works or public improvements of any description. Should the telecommunications system in any way interfere with the construction, maintenance or repair of such public works or public improvements, the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, protect or relocate its telecommunications system, or part thereof, as reasonably directed by the city officials or any governmental authority. In such instances, the city shall give the grantee reasonable notice to the extent practicable. This provision shall not preclude the grantee from being eligible for reimbursement from governmental authorities other than the city. 
(Ord. No. 95-60, 6-1-95) 
Sec. 28.1-13. - Emergency removal of plant. 
    If at any time, in case of fire or disaster in the city or other emergency, it shall become necessary in the reasonable judgment of the city to cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances or appurtenances of the telecommunications system, the city shall have the right to do so at the sole cost and expense of grantee. The grantee shall bear all costs of reinstallation, repair, and other costs resulting from or arising out of the emergency cutting or removal of the telecommunications system. The city shall consider all other measures prior to cutting the system. 
(Ord. No. 95-60, 6-1-95) 
Sec. 28.1-14. - Removal or abandonment. 
    Upon denial of renewal, revocation, or expiration of the franchise, grantee, at the city's discretion, shall remove all supporting structures, poles, transmission and distribution systems, and all other appurtenances from the streets and public rights-of-way and shall restore any property, public or private, to their original condition prior to the installation, erection, or construction of the telecommunications system. In the event of removal, restoration of city property, including, but not limited to, the public rights-of-way, shall be in accordance with the directions and specifications of all affected departments and agencies of the city, and all applicable law. The grantee shall accomplish such restoration at its expense. Such removal shall be made with the supervision of the city. If such removal and restoration is not completed within twelve (12) months after the notice by the city delivered in writing to grantee, all of the grantee's property remaining in the affected public rights-of-way shall, at the option of the city, be deemed abandoned and shall, at the option of the city, become the property of the city. In the event the grantee fails or refuses to remove its system or satisfactorily restore all areas to the condition in which they existed prior to the original construction of the system, the city, at its option, may perform such work and collect the cost thereof from the grantee. No surety on any bond shall be discharged until the city has certified to the grantee in writing that the system has been dismantled, removed, and all other property restored to the satisfaction of the city. 
(Ord. No. 95-60, 6-1-95) 
Sec. 28.1-15. - No waiver of rights. 
    No course of dealing between the grantee and the city nor any delay on the part of the city in exercising any rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any such rights of the city or acquiescence in the actions of the grantee in contravention of rights. 
(Ord. No. 95-60, 6-1-95) 
Sec. 28.1-16. - Transfer of ownership or control. 
(a)  Transfer of franchise. Any franchise granted hereunder cannot in any event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, including but not limited to, by force or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership or other means without the prior consent of the city, and then only under such conditions as the city may reasonably establish. Except that no consent shall be required for any sale, transfer, or assignment of ownership or control to an entity under common control with grantee, provided that prior to such transfer, grantee provides to the city verifiable information to establish that such transferee under common control has the financial, legal and technical ability to fully perform all obligations of the franchise. 
(b)  Transfer threshold. The grantee shall promptly notify the city of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of ownership or control of the grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the disposal by the grantee, directly or indirectly, by gift, assignment, voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of ten percent (10%) or more at one time of the controlling interest in the system, or twenty-five percent (25%) cumulatively over the term of the franchise of such interests to a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, trust or association, or person or group of persons acting in concert. Except that no consent shall be required for any sale, transfer, or assignment of ownership or control to an entity under common control with grantee, provided that prior to such transfer, grantee provides to the city verifiable information to establish that such transferee under common control has the financial, legal and technical ability to fully perform all obligations of the franchise. 
(c)  City approval. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the city shall have consented thereto. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the city may inquire into the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and the grantee shall provide the city with all required information. Failure to provide all information reasonably requested by the city as part of said inquiry shall be grounds for denial of the proposed change, transfer or acquisition of control. 
(d)  Assumption of control. The city agrees that any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the city that it will take control and operate the telecommunications system. If the financial institution takes possession of the telecommunications system the city shall take no action to effect a termination of the franchise without first giving to the lender written notice thereof and a period of six (6) months thereafter (unless otherwise provided hereinbelow) (1) to allow the financial institution or its agent(s) to continue operating as the franchisee under the franchise and; (2) to request the city, and for the city to determine whether to consent to the assignment of the grantee's rights, title, interest and obligations under the franchise to a qualified operator. The city acknowledges that in order for the financial institution to realize upon the collateral accorded to it by the loan documents, the financial institution must be entitled to a reasonable period of time after taking possession of the franchise under the loan document to obtain the city's consent to an assignment of the franchise to a qualified operator. The city agrees that such reasonable period of time is six (6) months after the financial institution takes possession of the telecommunication system and, further, agrees that the city shall use its best efforts to decide upon the assignment of the franchise to the new operator proposed by the financial institution within such period of time. The financial institution shall be entitled to such possession and other rights granted under this subsection until such time that the city determines whether to consent to such assignment (the "extended time"). If the city finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the city will consent to the transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest. During the six-month period or extended time, the financial institution shall enjoy all the rights, benefits and privileges of the grantee under the franchise, and the city shall not disturb such possession by the financial institution, provided the financial institution complies in all respects with the terms and provisions of the franchise and this chapter. The various rights granted to the financial institution under this subsection are contingent upon the lender's continuous compliance with the terms and provisions of this chapter and the franchise during the entire aforementioned six-month period or extended time, if applicable. For example, should an agent of the financial institution take possession of the telecommunication system pursuant to rights granted to the financial institution under this subsection, and such agent fails to comply with the level of service requirements set forth in this chapter or the franchise, the rights granted to the financial institution under this chapter and the franchise shall automatically terminate. 
(e)  No waiver of city property rights. The consent or approval of the city or any other public entity to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the city in and to the public property or public rights-of-way, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise. 
(f)  Signatory requirement. Any approval by the city of transfer of ownership or control shall be contingent upon the prospective transferee becoming a signatory to the franchise agreement. 
(Ord. No. 95-60, 6-1-95) 
Sec. 28.1-17. - Franchise renewal. 
    Upon completion of the term of any franchise granted under this chapter, the city may in its sole discretion grant or deny renewal of the franchise of the grantee. 
(Ord. No. 95-60, 6-1-95) 
Sec. 28.1-18. - Franchise fees. 
(a)  [Franchise fees in general.] The city finds that: 
(1)  The public rights-of-way to be used by the grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the franchise area are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the county, state, and city at great expense to its taxpayers, and 
(2)  The grant to the grantee to the said streets is a valuable property right without which the grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, and 
(3)  The administration of this chapter or the franchise imposes upon the city additional regulatory responsibility and expense, and 
(4)  The city reserves the right to charge an annual franchise fee for the use of the rights-of-way for a telecommunications system.

The council shall determine when water or sewer laterals are to be paid as a part of the water and sewer improvement and shall determine whether the laterals terminate at the curbline or at the property line. 
(b)  The assessment formula for water and sewer improvements shall be set at a rate that recovers eighty (80) percent of the construction cost. The construction cost would be based on the prior three years average of the construction costs of a 6-inch water line and an 8-inch sewer line. The assessment rate will be reviewed for any necessary adjustments once a year in coordination with the annual budget process. 
(c)  Upon receiving notice of completion of a water/sewer project, city council shall confirm all assessment obligations in said project and shall call for advertisement of same in a local newspaper published at least weekly and which is generally available to Greensboro citizens. Such advertisement shall run within forty-five (45) days following the date of confirmation and shall inform that all listed assessment obligations may be fully satisfied, without interest, if payment-in-full of the total principal balance is received by the tax collector within ninety (90) days following the date of confirmation. 
(d)  Assessment accounts not paid in full within ninety (90) days following the confirmation date shall be scheduled for payment in substantially equal installments, plus interest on the whole unpaid principal balance. Such interest shall be computed from the date of confirmation at a rate fixed in the assessment resolution, with said rate not exceeding the maximum allowed by law. The first installment shall become due and payable no later than one (1) year (three hundred sixty-five (365) days) following confirmation, with subsequent installments being due and payable on the regular and sequential cycle of the installment frequency (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually) elected by the obligee(s) and with the final installment being due and payable by not later than one hundred twenty (120) months after the confirmation date. 
    If the obligee expresses no preference as to payment frequency the assessment obligation will be scheduled for payment in ten (10) annual installments. Upon approval of the tax collector, the frequency of payment for existing assessment accounts may be changed for the economic and budgetary convenience of the obligee, with the first such change being granted without charge and with subsequent changes being granted with a transaction fee of thirty-five dollars ($35.00). 
(e)  At any time after the first ninety (90) days in the life of an assessment account the full principal balance may be paid in full with all accrued interest and without early payoff penalty.

Sec. 29-53. - System development fees; capacity use fees; declaration of purpose. 
    There are hereby established system development fees and capacity use fees as hereafter set out. The purpose of the system development fee and the capacity use fee is to partially recover directly from new customers the costs of the capacity of the utility system to serve them. 
    The system development fee shall be applied to new development that connects to the utility system. New development shall be defined as any of the following: 1) the subdivision of land; 2) the construction, reconstruction, redevelopment, conversion, structural alteration, relocation, or enlargement of any structure which increases the number of meters or increases the meter size; or 3) any use or extension of the use of land which increases the number of meters or increases the meter size which began after November 29, 2017. 
    The capacity use fee shall be applied to existing development that connects to the utility system. Existing development shall be defined as land subdivisions, structures, and land uses in existence as of November 29, 2017. 
    It is hereby declared that such charges are reasonable and necessary and results in a more equitable and economically efficient method of recovery of such costs to handle new growth and to serve new customers without placing an additional financial burden on existing customers solely through inordinate enhancement of water and sewer rates. Hence the following and system development fees and capacity use fees are adopted and approved as follows: 
(a)  System development fees: The system development fees shall be set at the rate as outlined in G.S. § 162A-200 et seq. (Session Law 2017-188 (HB 436)). The City of Greensboro completed the required supporting analysis in accordance with G.S. § 162A-205 et seq. A copy of the study shall be filed with the city clerk, and the study may be accessed on the City of Greensboro website. 
The system development fee shall be imposed for new development to fund costs necessitated by and attributable to the costs associated with new development and system growth. The fee is based on the blended value of both the existing and expanded system capacity and its calculation includes both existing assets and future capital projects required to serve growth. 
The system development fee shall not exceed the allowable calculated amount as determined by the supporting analysis under G.S. § 162A-205 et seq. and the supporting analysis shall be updated at least every 5 years.

Any multifamily project (including, but not limited to, apartments, condominiums, duplexes, townhomes, etc.) shall be charged a system development fee or a capacity use fee equal to fifty (50) percent of the charges set forth for a five-eighths-inch meter times the number of living units included in the dwelling(s) to be served. 
With respect to the system development fee or the capacity use fee based on a five-eighths-inch water meter, any single-family dwelling unit having less than one thousand eight hundred twenty-two (1,822) heated square feet may pay the capacity use fee based on the actual heated square footage of the dwelling unit. The computation for determining the charge shall be as follows: 
Water-Heated sq. ft. area × CUF Water Residential Rate ° 1,822 = 
Sewer-Heated sq. ft. area × CUF Sewer Residential Rate ° 1,822 = 
Total capacity use fee = Sum of above calculation.

Sec. 29-53.2. - Credits. 
    Credits are provided to customers for parcels of land that already have an existing water and/or sewer service connection(s). This credit is provided to recognize the system capacity already allocated for the existing connection(s) serving a parcel that is being redeveloped or upgraded to require an increased-sized service connection(s). 
    In order for the water resources department to determine whether a customer qualifies for this credit and the value of the credit, the following must be done: 
(a)  Water and/or sewer services to be abandoned must be abandoned at the main and shown on the construction drawing(s) with the property address(es). 
(b)  Water resources or engineering and inspections department inspectors must provide documented verification of abandonment for each address provided on construction drawing(s). 
(c)  Water resources records must validate that the service(s) described herein is a valid legal connection(s) based on records research. 
    The value of previous connection(s) will be calculated based on the current fees in effect at the time of application for new connection(s). This calculated value of the previous connection(s) will be deducted from the fees calculated for the new service connections resulting in a net cost for new service. 
    In the case of exceeding credits, no refund will be given nor will the customer be allowed to apply credits toward another project. However, a project may include more than one parcel of contiguous property and those credits for all individual parcels may be collectively applied toward the fee associated with establishing any new connection(s) for those same contiguous parcels even if recombined. 
    In no case shall credits result in a net refund for a project.

If the provisions of this ordinance are inconsistent with one another, or if they conflict with provisions found in
other adopted ordinances or regulations of the city, the more restrictive provision governs. The more
restrictive provision is the one that imposes greater restrictions or more stringent controls.
30-1-8.3 Conflict with Private Agreements and Controls
This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing easements,
covenants, deed restrictions, agreements, or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law. The city

No building, premises, or structure may be located, extended, altered, constructed, erected, modified,
converted, occupied, placed, maintained, or moved, and no land use may be commenced, maintained, or
modified, except as authorized by this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
30-1-10 Official Zoning Map Established
The location and boundaries of zoning districts established by this ordinance are shown on a geographic
coverage layer entitled Zoning that is maintained as part of the citys geographic information system (GIS)
under the direction of the Planning and Community Development Director. This Zoning geographic coverage
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 28
layer constitutes the City of Greensboros official zoning map, and is as much a part of this ordinance as if
actually depicted within the pages of this ordinance. The Planning and Community Development Director must
direct revisions to the official zoning map to reflect its amendment as soon as possible after the effective date
of zoning map amendments. No unauthorized person may alter or modify the official zoning map. The
Planning and Community Development Director may authorize printed copies of the official zoning map to be
produced, and must maintain digital or printed copies of superseded versions of the official zoning map for
historical reference.
30-1-10.1 District Boundaries
Where the ordinance establishing a zoning boundary identifies the boundary as following a particular feature,
or reflects a clear intent that the boundary follows the feature, the boundary will be construed as following
that feature as it actually exists.
30-1-10.2 Boundary Interpretations
A. Where any uncertainty exists about a zoning boundary, the Planning and Community Development
Director is authorized to interpret the boundarys location using the following rules of interpretation:
1. A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately following a lot line or parcel boundary is
construed as following the lot line or parcel boundary as it actually existed at the time the zoning
boundary was established.
2. A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately following a river, stream, lake or other
watercourse is construed as following the actual centerline of the watercourse.
3. A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately following a street or alley is generally
construed as following the right-of-way line of the street or alley.
4. A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately following a railroad line is construed as
following the centerline of the railroad.
5. A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately following the boundary of a municipality or of
its extraterritorial jurisdiction is construed as following that boundary.
6. A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately parallel to, or as an apparent extension of, a
feature described above is construed as being actually parallel to, or an extension of, the feature.
7. Outer boundaries of General Watershed Area overlay districts indicated as approximately following
ridgelines or streets are construed to follow ridgelines (the actual drainage basin boundaries) or street
right-of-way or centerlines. Watershed Critical Area district outer boundaries not abutting General
Watershed Area overlay districts are construed in the same manner. Boundaries between General
Watershed Area overlay districts and Watershed Critical Area overlay districts indicated as
approximately following major landmarks (identifiable major features) such as streets are construed to
follow the right-of-way or centerlines of such features or, where applicable, the projections of the
right-of-way or centerlines of such features.
8. Past zoning maps may be consulted to aid in interpreting boundary lines.
B. Appeals of administrative interpretations of zoning boundaries may be taken to the Board of Adjustment in
accordance with 30-4-27.
30-1-11 Annexation
If any portion of the territory subject to county jurisdiction is annexed by the city or taken into the citys
extraterritorial jurisdiction by act of the General Assembly or in accordance with NCGS 160A, Article 4A or
NCGS 160A-360, county regulations and powers of enforcement remain in effect until:
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 29
30-1-11.1 the city has adopted regulations for the annexed or extraterritorial area; or
30-1-11.2 a period of 60 days has elapsed following the effective date of annexation or extension of
extraterritorial jurisdiction.
30-1-12 Transitional Provisions
30-1-12.1 Effect on Valid Building Permits and Vested Rights
Unless the subject owner voluntarily agrees to comply with this ordinance the owner is entitled to complete
development of buildings or uses pursuant to approved development plans, for which either:
A. building permits have been issued pursuant to G.S. 160A417 prior to July 1, 2010, so long as the permits
remain valid and unexpired pursuant to G.S. 160A418 and unrevoked pursuant to G.S. 160A422; or
B. a vested right has been established pursuant to G.S. 160A385.1 and such vested right remains valid and
unexpired pursuant to G.S. 160A385.1.
30-1-12.2 Other Approval Granted before Effective Date
Variances, special use permits, subdivision plats, site plans, and other similar development approvals that are
valid on June 30, 2010, will remain valid until their expiration date. Development may be completed in
accordance with such unexpired approvals even if such building, development or structure does not fully
comply with provisions of this ordinance. If development is not commenced and diligently pursued in the time
allowed under the original approval or any extension granted, then the building, development or structure
must meet the standards of this ordinance in effect at the time of any re-application.
Commentary: Legislation passed by the General Assembly in 2009 (Session Law 2009 - 406 {S 831}, as
amended by Session Law 2009 - 484 {S 838}, Session Law 2009 - 550 {S 274}, and Session Law 2009 - 572
{H-1490} affects automatic extension of building permits and development permits of all kinds under this
ordinance. For any such permits or approval that were current and valid at any point during the period
beginning January 1, 2008 and ending December 31, 2011, the running of the period of development approval
and any associated vested right under G.S. 160A-385.1 is suspended or tolled during that period.
30-1-12.3 Applications in Progress before Effective Date
Applications for building permits, variances, special use permits, subdivision plats, site plans and other similar
development approvals that were submitted in complete form and are pending approval on June 30, 2010,
must be reviewed wholly under the terms of the ordinance in effect on June 30, 2010, unless the applicant
elects to comply with the standards of this ordinance. Any re-application for an expired approval must meet
the standards of this ordinance in effect at the time of re-application.
30-1-12.4 Violations Continue
Violations of the previous ordinance will continue to be violations under this ordinance and be subject to
penalties and enforcement under Article 5. The adoption of this ordinance does not affect nor prevent any
pending or future action to abate violations of previous ordinances.
30-1-12.5 Existing Uses
A. When a use classified as a special use under this ordinance exists as an approved special use or as a
permitted use on June 30, 2010, such use will be considered a lawfully established special use.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 30
B. When any amendment to this ordinance changes the classification of a permitted use to a special use, any
use lawfully established before the effective date of such amendment will be considered a lawfully
established special use after the effective date of such amendment.
Commentary: Paragraphs (A) and (B), above are intended to clarify that lawful, existing uses are
not rendered nonconforming (or illegal) merely because they were not approved through the special
use process.
C. A lawfully established existing use that is not allowed as a special use or as a permitted use in the district
in which the use is now located will be considered a nonconforming use and will be subject to all
applicable regulations of Article 2 (Nonconformities).
30-1-13 Severability
Should any section, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this ordinance be held invalid or unconstitutional by a
court of competent jurisdiction of either the State of North Carolina or the United States, such decision does
not affect, impair, or invalidate the validity of the remaining parts of this ordinance that can be given effect
without the invalid provision.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 31
Article 2. Nonconformities
30-2-1 General
The regulations of this article govern lots, uses, buildings, signs and other aspects of development that came
into existence lawfully but do not conform to one or more requirements of this ordinance. These are referred
to as nonconformities, which should not be confused with illegal uses or structures.
30-2-1.1 Scope
The regulations of this article govern lots, uses, buildings, signs and other aspects of development that came
into existence lawfully but do not conform to one or more requirements of this ordinance. These are referred
to as nonconformities, which should not be confused with illegal uses or structures.
30-2-1.2 Intent
The regulations of this article are intended to:
A. recognize the interests of property owners in continuing to use their property for lawful purposes;
B. promote reuse and rehabilitation of existing buildings; and
C. place reasonable limits on the expansion and alteration of nonconformities that have the potential to
adversely affect surrounding properties or the community as a whole.
30-2-1.3 Determination of Nonconforming Status
A. If the Planning and Community Development Director cannot determine a propertys nonconforming
status, then the burden of proving that a situation is nonconforming (as opposed to illegal) rests with the
subject landowner.
B. In situations where a copy of the approved plan for a project cannot be located, the landowner may
provide reasonable evidence of the existing improvements. Such evidence may be offered by any
reasonable means including but not limited to an affidavit signed by the owner or other party. After
submission of evidence of the existing improvements, the Planning and Community Development Director
shall reasonably determine their status using the ordinances in effect at the time of the installation of the
improvements.
30-2-1.4 Determination of Value
The value of property shall be presumed to be the propertys tax value unless rebutted by competent evidence
presented by the owner to the Planning and Community Development Director. Competent evidence shall
include certified appraisals and comparable sales or purchase prices within 3 years of the damage.
30-2-1.5 Repairs and Maintenance
A. Incidental repairs and normal maintenance of nonconformities are permitted unless the repairs are
otherwise expressly prohibited by this ordinance. For the purpose of this provision, repair or replacement
of non-load bearing walls, fixtures, electrical or plumbing are considered incidental repairs if the total value
of the repairs in any 12-month period does not exceed 50% of the tax value of the structure.
B. Nothing in this article is to be construed to prevent structures from being structurally strengthened or
restored to a safe condition, in accordance with an official order of the Building Inspector or other duly
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 32
authorized city official. When improvements are made to restore property to a safe condition, the cost of
those repairs or alterations are included in the 50% limit noted in the preceding paragraph.
30-2-1.6 Change of Tenancy or Ownership
Nonconforming status "runs with the land" and is not affected by changes of tenancy, ownership, or
management.
30-2-2 Nonconforming Lot of Record
30-2-2.1 Nonconforming Lots Resulting from Public Acquisition
Lots of record that are rendered nonconforming or more nonconforming as a result of acquisition of a portion
of the lot for public purposes by any public agency have the status of nonconforming lots of record.
30-2-2.2 Use of Nonconforming Lots
Nonconforming lots of record may be used in accordance with this ordinance.
A. Lots with Contiguous Frontage in One Ownership
Where 2 or more lots of record with contiguous frontage are under common ownership, and one or more
is a nonconforming lot, the lots shall be deemed merged into a single zone lot to the extent necessary to
create one or more lots that comply with or come as close as possible to complying with the lot
requirements of the underlying zoning district. This provision does not apply to contiguous nonconforming
lots of record that are at least 40 feet in width and have not, at any time since July 1, 1992, provided
required setbacks, parking, or landscaping for a use situated on an adjacent lot. These may be considered
Single Lots of Record under subsection (B) below.
B. Single Lot of Record
1. A nonconforming lot of record may be built upon if compliance is achieved with regard to all ordinance
requirements except for lot area or width.
2. In residential zoning districts, only a single-family dwelling may be permitted on a nonconforming lot
of record.
30-2-3 Nonconforming Use
30-2-3.1 Continuation
A nonconforming use may continue, subject to the regulations of this ordinance.
30-2-3.2 Expansion or Alteration of a Nonconforming Use
A. The Planning and Community Development Director may approve a Type 1 Modification in accordance with
30-4-11 allowing alteration of a nonconforming use that does not increase the degree of nonconformity, or
have a greater adverse impact on the surrounding area. To make a determination, the Planning and
Community Development Director must consider all of the following criteria:
1. anticipated traffic of each use;
2. parking requirements of each use;
3. anticipated number of persons on the premises of each use at a time of peak demand;
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 33
4. off-site impacts of each use, such as lighting, noise, glare, dust, odor, vibration, or smoke; and
5. hours of operation.
B. A nonconforming use may not be relocated, in whole or in part, to another portion of the subject lot or
parcel.
C. A nonconforming use may not be expanded, enlarged, or extended to occupy a greater area of land or
floor area.

Expansion or alteration decisions may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with 30-4-27.
30-2-3.3 Damage or Destruction
A nonconforming use that is damaged by fire, neglect, or natural causes may retain nonconforming status if
the damage to the structure does not exceed 50% of its pre-damage tax value, according to bona fide repair
estimates provided by the subject property owner.
30-2-3.4 Change of Use
A. Change to a Conforming Use
The Planning and Community Development Director may allow a nonconforming use to be changed to any
use allowed in the subject zoning district provided compliance with all applicable ordinance requirements is
achieved. Administrative change of use decisions may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in
accordance with the procedures of 30-4-27
B. Change to Another Nonconforming Use
The Board of Adjustment may allow a nonconforming use to be changed to another nonconforming use
that is in the same use category, as per 30-8-3, or to another functionally similar use or less intensive use,
if the Board of Adjustment determines that the proposed use will have no greater adverse impacts on the
surrounding area. To make a determination, the Board of Adjustment must consider all of the criteria of
30-2-3.2.
Commentary: See 30-8-3 for an explanation of use categories.
30-2-3.5 New Signs with Nonconforming Use
The Planning and Community Development Director may approve a Type 1 Modification in accordance with 30-
4-11 allowing replacement signs (See 30-14-15) for a nonconforming use, provided the replacement sign is no
larger or taller and does not use more intensive illumination or a different type of illumination than the signs
being replaced. This approval must be conditioned upon removal of any existing nonconforming signs on the
site. Applications for new signs or signs larger or taller than the signs being replaced require approval of a
Special Exception Permit by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with 30-4-14.
30-2-3.6 Loss of Nonconforming Use Status
A. Discontinuance

control of the owner may not be replaced if the damage to the structure exceeds 50% of its pre-damage
tax value.
30-2-3.7 Accessory Uses and Structures
A use that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use may not be continued after the principal use has
been abandoned, unless the use is also an accessory use to other principal uses allowed in the subject zoning
district.

subject zoning district.
4. Applicants proposing alterations to nonconforming structures located within locally designated historic

as applicable.
B. Damage or Destruction
A nonconforming structure (except as provided for in 30-2-5.5) that has been damaged by accidental
causes beyond the control of the owner may be reconstructed if the damage to the structure is less than
50% of its pre-damage tax value or 75% of pre-damage tax value for locally designated landmarks or
contributing structures in locally designated historic districts or national register historic districts, provided
that
1. it is constructed in the same location and up to the same dimensions as originally existed or it complies
with dimensional requirements in effect at the time of replacement; and
2. a permit for reconstruction is obtained within 2 years of the date of damage.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 35
30-2-4.2 Loss of Nonconforming Status

exceptions to this rule apply:
A. Except when located in a floodway, residential condominium and townhouse buildings may be rebuilt using
the same footprint or a reduced footprint and the same or a smaller gross floor area. Any other structure
or improvements related to the residential condominium or townhouse development may be rebuilt.
B. Except when located in a floodway, residential buildings in multi-family developments with a density that is
no more than 10% above the maximum density allowed in the subject zoning district may be rebuilt.
Buildings may be rebuilt using the same footprint, or at another location approved by the Technical Review
Committee; but the gross floor area may not be increased.
C. Regulations governing the maximum number of units per building in townhouse developments apply only
to developments approved after June 30, 2010. All townhouse developments in existence on June 30,

30-2-5.5 Nonconforming Outdoor Advertising Signs
A. Damage or Destruction
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 37
Outdoor advertising signs must be brought into compliance or removed if the damage to the sign from any
cause equals 50% or more of its replacement value according to bona fide repair and replacement cost
estimates provided by the sign owner.
B. Replacement and Relocation Generally
Outdoor advertising signs, except for those in the CB overlay district and subject to Subsection C., may be
replaced with signs that comply with the following standards. Outdoor advertising signs constructed in
compliance with these standards will be deemed conforming outdoor advertising signs and the
nonconforming sign regulations of this section will no longer apply to such signs.
1. Location
The replacement sign must be located in the same place on the same property, unless another
location within 200 feet is shown to have equal or better performance in fitting with the current or
proposed site development and to have no greater adverse visual impact from surrounding streets.
Such relocation may be approved by the Technical Review Committee in accordance with the Type 2
Modification procedures of 30-4-11.
2. Sign Placement
When a replacement sign is attached to or near a building, it must be sized and located so as not to
cover or substantially block the view of architectural building elements or active windows and doors
and not to overhang edges of the building. Also, no digital or electronic display may be placed within
1,000 feet of another outdoor advertising sign with a digital or electronic display facing the same
direction.
3. Compatible Sign frame
Replacement signs must have a frame on all 4 sides of any new sign face. The area of the frame must
be at least 10% of the area of the sign. The frame must also be made of materials that match or are
clearly compatible with materials, styles, and colors of nearby buildings and structures or that use
different styles and materials to produce a clearly improved appearance. This provision does not apply
to billboards within 400 feet of an interstate highway. The Technical Review Committee is authorized
to determine compatibility of materials.
4. Reduced Visual Impact
To offset the construction of the replacement sign, the new sign must reduce visual impacts as
follows:
a. Existing outdoor advertising signs with a sign face of 14 x 48 may be replaced by signs no larger
than 11 x 36. Existing outdoor advertising signs smaller than 11 x 36 may not be enlarged;
b. Replacement outdoor advertising signs may not exceed 35 feet in height (See sign height
measurement provisions of 30-14-16.2)
c. Existing outdoor advertising signs with multiple faces visible from a single direction may not be
replaced with stacked or side-by-side sign faces visible from the same direction. If existing sideby-
side or stacked signs whose individual sign areas are smaller than 11 x 36, both signs may be
removed and replaced by one 11 x 36 sign face.
5. Landscaping
To offset the construction of a permanent new sign, landscaping shall be provided on site, either
below the sign face or next to the sign in a visible location. If plantings are judged by Technical
Review Committee to not be feasible to be placed on site, a modification of equal or better payment
in lieu of landscaping planting may be made to the GBI/City tree planting fund. On-site plantings shall
not obscure the view of the sign, shall be primarily evergreen materials and shall fit with Type C (10
wide) planting yard standards for the distance of the sign width. Public art installations may be
provided in place of up to 50% of the landscaping requirement, in consultation with the public arts
commission and/or the United Arts Council.
C. Replacement and Relocation in CB Overlay District
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 38
Nonconforming outdoor advertising signs within the boundaries of the CB overlay district that are attached
to or freestanding within 2 feet of a building or other improvement that is being demolished as part of
redevelopment of the site may be relocated subject to the following requirements:
1. Location
a. The outdoor advertising sign must be located along the same street that the original outdoor
advertising sign faces or any other street, except South Elm Street;
b. Relocating the outdoor advertising sign into any residential, office or Public and Institutional zoning
district shall be prohibited; and
c. The outdoor advertising sign must be located within 2,000 feet of the original outdoor advertising
sign but not within 200 feet of another outdoor advertising sign facing the same direction on the
same street.
2. Size and Design
The outdoor advertising sign may not be increased in size nor height above the ground, must contain
the same or less illumination as the original outdoor advertising sign, and must be as flush with the
wall surface as possible.
3. Compatibility
The outdoor advertising sign must be sized, scaled, located and framed so as to be compatible with
the nearby building on which the sign is located. Consideration shall be given to outdoor advertising
signs that do not cover wall openings while fitting the available space on the wall, the use of framing
materials similar to the wall and the building on which the outdoor advertising sign is to be mounted
and other relevant design factors.
4. Modifications
The Technical Review Committee may grant a Type 2 Modification in accordance with 30-4-11 if the
alternate standards portrayed on the sign permit demonstrate equal or better performance related to
the general impact of the sign as viewed from the street.
5. Status
Outdoor advertising signs relocated in compliance with these standards continue to be deemed a
nonconforming sign and subject to the provisions contained within this section.

30-4-5.4 Transportation Impact Study
A. Applicability
1. A Transportation Impact Study may be required by the City of Greensboro Department of
Transportation for any development or property that has experienced a change in zoning classification
after July 1, 1999 and is projected to generate 100 trips during the adjacent street AM or PM peak
hour or 1,000 average daily trips.
2. A Transportation Impact Study is required for all developments that have experienced a change in
zoning classification after July 1, 1999 and are projected to generate 150 trips during the adjacent
street AM or PM peak hour or 1,500 average daily trips.
3. A Transportation Impact Study may be required for any redevelopment or change in use of an existing
occupied development that has experienced a change in zoning classification after July 1, 1999 that
would generate 100 additional trips during the adjacent street AM or PM peak hour or 1,000 additional
daily trips.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 71
4. A Transportation Impact Study is required when the subject development is expected to generate 150
additional trips during the adjacent street AM or PM peak hour or 1,500 additional daily trips, subject
to the exemptions set out in 30-4-5.4(B).
5. When sufficient information on the proposed development is available for GDOT to determine that the
aforementioned criteria is met, a Transportation Impact Study must be submitted with all preliminary
plats, site plans, site plan revisions, Special Use Permit applications, conditional rezoning applications,
and conditional original zoning applications where the proposed city zoning entails greater trip
generation than does the existing county zoning.
6. Trip rates must be based on trip generation rates contained in the latest edition of Trip Generation
published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) or any local trip generation rates either
published or approved by GDOT. Additional trips must be determined by subtracting the gross trip
generation of the existing use from the gross trip generation of the proposed use. The additional trip
calculation applies to property that is occupied at the time of submittal or has been occupied at any
time prior to submittal.
7. If a development or property has experienced a change in zoning classification after July 1, 1999 and
special circumstances exist, GDOT may require a Transportation Impact Study without regard to the
expected trip generation of the development. Factors that would warrant such a requirement are:
a. there are existing levels of service deficiencies in the area of the proposed development. ("Level of
Service" as defined in the Highway Capacity ManualTransportation Research Board Special Report
209 ); or
b. available accident data and/or operational and geometric factors indicate safety concerns.
B. Exemptions
1. Notwithstanding the applicability thresholds above, a Transportation Impact Study is not required if the
property to be rezoned or developed has been the subject of a Transportation Impact Study within the
previous 3 years and the projected trip generation of the newly proposed development is equal to or
less than the previous study performed and the trip distribution has not significantly changed.
2. Developments or properties that have not experienced a change in zoning classification since July 1,
1999 are not required to prepare a Transportation Impact Study as a part of their site plan approval;
however, any such development projected to generate 100 trips during the adjacent street AM or PM
peak hour or 1,000 average daily trips must provide traffic information and attend a pre-submittal
conference with GDOT at least 21 days before site plan submittal. Together with the developer, GDOT
will identify any areas of concern and/or issues that must be analyzed prior to site plan approval. The
traffic information must be submitted to GDOT at least 3 business days prior to the pre-submittal
conference and must include all of the following:
a. preliminary site plan that includes a vicinity map and proposed layout for the development that
shows the proposed and existing points of access in the area and the proposed traffic circulation
plan;
b. projected trip generation based on the ITE manual referenced above;
c. projected trip distribution map showing the origin and destination of the development traffic; and
d. schedule and proposed build-out year for the development.
C. Study Preparation
1. A licensed professional engineer who has completed the GDOT self-certification form must attend a
presubmittal conference with GDOT and prepare the Transportation Impact Study. The draft
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 72
Transportation Impact Study must be submitted to GDOT at least 21 days before filing the zoning map
amendment application.
2. The Transportation Impact Study must follow the guidelines prepared by GDOT. The Transportation
Impact Study must address:
a. the proposed land use,
b. the trip generation of the proposed use,
c. site access,
d. modal splits, if appropriate,
e. impacts on the transportation system from the proposed development, and
f. physical improvements or enforceable management strategies to mitigate negative impacts.
3. At a minimum, the Transportation Impact Study must identify the improvements necessary to maintain
Level of Service D for streets and intersections as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual -
Transportation Research Board Special Report 209 . GDOT will provide current traffic count information
for use in Transportation Impact Studies if such counts are available.
4. The Transportation Impact Study must be reviewed and approved by GDOT before being considered
by City Council or any planning agency of the city.
D. Improvements
As a part of subdivision, site plan and driveway permit approval, the Technical Review Committee may
require needed transportation improvements for the property requesting development approval; however,
a Transportation Impact Study may not be utilized as a means for staff to require the party developing the
property to make needed transportation improvements remote from the property for which the
Transportation Impact Study is submitted, nor may identified deficiencies in level of service automatically
be used to preclude approval of the proposed development.
30-4-5.5 ConditionsConditional District
A. In a conditional district, conditions may specify the location on the property of the proposed use; the
number of dwelling units; the location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways,
and access streets; design elements of the proposed use; the location and extent of buffer areas and other
special purpose areas; the timing of development; the location and extent of rights-of-way and other areas
to be dedicated for public purposes; the alteration of streets to mitigate traffic and environmental impacts;
use limitations; and other matters the applicant proposes as conditions upon the request.
B. Any conditions imposed in association with a conditional district and so authorized are perpetually binding
upon the property included within the conditional district unless subsequently changed or amended as
provided for in this section.
C. In approving a conditional district, the Zoning Commission or City Council may, with agreement of the
applicant, impose more restrictive requirements than would otherwise be required by this ordinance and
those in the application, as deemed necessary to ensure that the purposes and intent of this ordinance are
met.
D. A new public hearing is required for consideration of a substantial change in conditions, as determined by
the Planning and Community Development Director in accordance with the criteria of 30-4-5.10.
E. No condition on a conditional district application may have the effect of removing or amending any
requirement of this ordinance.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 73
F. Other than use conditions, no proposed condition can be a mere repetition of an already applicable
requirement of this ordinance. The Planning and Community Development Director may order the removal
of any such condition from the application.
G. The Planning Director may remove from the application any condition deemed unenforceable or unclear.
30-4-5.6 Zoning CommissionReview and Recommendation/Decision

application to the Zoning Commission, together with the Planning and Community Development
Departments recommendations, at the first regularly scheduled meeting following proper filing and notice
of the application unless the case is continued (as per 30-4-5.16).
D. Following the close of the public hearing, the Zoning Commission shall take action on the amendment.
1. The Zoning Commission must advise and comment on whether the proposed amendment is consistent
with the Comprehensive Plan, and it must adopt a written statement that addresses consistency
between the proposed amendment and the Comprehensive Plan (and other matters as deemed
relevant by the Zoning Commission) and explain why the Zoning Commission considers the action
taken to be reasonable and in the public interest. That statement is not subject to judicial review.
However, concluding that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan does
not preclude approval of the proposed amendment.
2. Zoning map amendment applications that are accompanied by Comprehensive Plan amendments must
be heard by the City Council unless the Zoning Commission approves the application by unanimous
vote and that action is not appealed. If the accompanying zoning map amendment is given final
approval by the Zoning Commission and that action is not appealed, the Comprehensive Plan
amendment will also be deemed approved. Likewise, if a zoning map amendment that is accompanied
by a Comprehensive Plan amendment is denied and that action is not appealed, the proposed plan
amendment will also be deemed to have been denied.
3. For zoning map amendments that are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Commission
is authorized to take final action on the application. In such cases, 6 or more favorable votes from the
Zoning Commission shall constitute final action to approve the application unless the action is appealed
in accordance with paragraph (E), below. If no appeal is made, a copy of the ordinance rezoning the
property is filed with the City Clerk.
4. When a zoning map amendment application receives a tie vote or an unfavorable vote from the Zoning
Commission, that action constitutes denial of the application, unless appealed in accordance with
paragraph (E), below.
5. When an application receives a majority favorable vote consisting of less than 6 favorable votes from
the Zoning Commission, that action constitutes a recommendation to approve the zoning map
amendment application and is forwarded to the City Council for final action.
E. Any final decision of the Zoning Commission on a zoning map amendment may be appealed to the City
Council by any person in accordance with 30-4-1.6. Such appeals must be made within 10 days of the
Zoning Commissions decision by filing a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk or Planning and
Community Development Department.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 74
30-4-5.7 City CouncilFinal Action
A. The following zoning map amendment applications must be scheduled for public hearing before the City
Council:
1. those that require a Comprehensive Plan amendment, as required by 30-4-5.6(D)2);
2. those that receive a majority favorable vote from the Zoning Commission consisting of fewer than 6
favorable votes;
3. all appealed zoning map amendment decisions of the Zoning Commission;
4. all original zoning map amendments; and
5. all establishments of and changes to overlay district boundaries.
B. The City Council must hear only those zoning map amendment applications that have been heard by the
Zoning Commission. Upon receipt of recommendations, proper appeals, and any applications that have not
been acted upon by the Zoning Commission as specified in the Continuance provisions of 30-4-5.16, the
City Council must hold a public hearing on such applications.
C. Prior to approving or denying any zoning amendment application, the City Council must adopt a written
statement that addresses consistency between the proposed amendment and the Comprehensive Plan
(and other matters as deemed relevant by the City Council) and explains why the City Council considers
the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest. That statement is not subject to judicial
review. However, concluding that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan
does not preclude approval of the proposed amendment.
D. Except as provided for in 30-4-5.5 (Conditional DistrictConditions) or 30-4-10.6 (Special Use Permits
Conditions), the City Council may not change or modify, or otherwise permit any change or revision to any
application; however, the City Council may allow a reduction in size of the area of an application. Other
changes or revisions to applications constitute a new application and must be resubmitted as a new
application for zoning map amendment. After completion of the public hearing, the City Council must take
such lawful action as it may deem advisable.
30-4-5.8 [Reserved]
(Amended by Ord. 15-121 on 9/15/15)
30-4-5.9 Successive Applications
A. No application for a zoning map amendment to the same district on a given property or portion thereof
may be filed within a one-year period from:
1. the date of final action by the Zoning Commission or the City Council; or

City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 75
30-4-5.10 Substantial Changes
A. The Planning and Community Development Director is authorized to determine when a development
proposal constitutes a substantial change to a condition of approval imposed through the zoning map
amendment, rezoning, special use permit or other development approval process, in accordance with the
following regulations.
1. A change will be deemed substantial if it:
a. decreases the number or extent of mixed-use features, including combinations of different land
uses, integrated site design, strong pedestrian and vehicle connectivity, and strong orientation of
buildings to streets (sidewalks);
b. decreases use of compatible design features, including architectural styles and materials, signage
and lighting, and site layout, among both internal development and with appropriate adjacent
external development;
c. decreases pedestrian features, including added sidewalks, crosswalks, bus stops, pedestrian
amenities, small block site layout or internal and external pedestrian connections; or
d. changes the use category permitted as per Table 8-1, within any portion of the development.
2. A change will not be deemed substantial if it reduces impacts on surrounding properties in one or more
of the following ways:
a. a greater than 10% decrease in the intensity of the land uses proposed on the site (e.g., number
of housing units or gross floor area);
b. a greater than 10% increase in proposed setbacks by locating the proposed buildings closer to
internal property lines without increasing the setbacks of proposed buildings from public streets;
c. a significant increase in the visually obscuring buffers along the perimeter of the site (not including
toward streets) that includes preserved vegetation, added landscaping, walls and fences, or the
use of topography;
d. a decrease in the traffic impact due to a significant decrease or shift in the number, location or
configuration of access points to or additional road improvements for the development; or
e. a greater than 10% increase in the amount of usable or passive open space, tree preservation,
greenways, or trails provided on the site.

criteria in 30-4-5.10, by following the same procedure as that required for the original approval of the
conditional district. Requests to change or amend use regulations that apply in a conditional district may
be considered without regard for when the conditional district was first approved or last amended.
B. The Planning Board may approve Type 3 Modifications in accordance with 30-4-11 for all other changes,
provided that the modification does not change or amend the use category, as per Table 8-1, allowed in
the conditional district.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 76
30-4-5.13 Conditional DistrictViolation of Conditions
Any violation of a condition in an approved conditional district will be treated the same as any other violation
of this ordinance and is subject to the same remedies and penalties as any such violation. Any violation of
such a condition is deemed to be the same type of violation as the use of a property for a use not permitted
under the district regulations, for the same reason that any use permitted in a conditional district is permitted
only subject to the specified conditions.
30-4-5.14 Conditional DistrictRevocation
If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or invalid, or if the
applicant should fail to comply with any condition, proceedings must be instituted to rezone the property to its
previous zoning classification or another zoning classification consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
30-4-5.15 Application Withdrawal
A zoning map amendment application may be withdrawn by the applicant by filing a written notice of
withdrawal with the Planning and Community Development Department at least 24 days before the Zoning

upon an amendment following all proper continuances, the petitioner may take the amendment to the City
Council without a recommendation from the Zoning Commission.

30-4-11 Modifications
30-4-11.1 Purpose
Recognizing that it is sometimes possible to provide equal or better performance in furtherance of the
purposes of this ordinance through use of means other than those specified in this ordinance, the City Council
finds it to be reasonably necessary and expedient that provisions be made for limited flexibility in
administration of certain standards in this ordinance.
30-4-11.2 Description
A. There are 5 classes of Modifications: Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, Type 4 and Type 5. These modifications are
specified technical exceptions that may be approved without going through the Variance process. Approval
is limited to the specified exceptions and adjustments expressly authorized by this ordinance only when
the general criteria of 30-4-11.3 have been met.
B. The different types of modifications correspond to the increasing sensitivity or impact differential of the
proposed change, or the authority responsible for approving the modification. The level of reviewranging
from Type 1 to Type 5is generally intended to be commensurate with the degree of deviation and/or the
anticipated impacts of the requested modification.
1. Type 1 Modifications
Final decision-making authority on Type 1 Modifications rests with the department director with
general responsibility for administering and interpreting the subject regulation or standard. Type 1
Modifications involve modifications to regulations and standards that are very minor (de minimis ) in
nature. Regulations and standards are eligible for modification through the Type 1 procedure only
when expressly authorized by this ordinance.
2. Type 2 Modifications
The Technical Review Committee is authorized to approve most Type 2 Modifications, which involve
modifications to regulations and standards that are similar to type 1 modifications but which benefit
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 94
from inter-agency review. Regulations and standards are eligible for modification through the Type 2
procedure only when expressly authorized by this ordinance.
3. Type 3 Modifications
The Planning Board is authorized to approve Type 3 Modifications after review by the Technical Review
Committee. Type 3 modifications involve changes or amendments to conditional zoning districts and
special use permits. Regulations and standards are eligible for modification through the Type 3
procedure only when expressly authorized by this ordinance.
4. Type 4 Modifications
The City Council is authorized to approve Type 4 Modifications after review by the Technical Review
Committee and Planning Board. Regulations and standards are eligible for modification through the
Type 4 procedure only when expressly authorized by this ordinance.
5. Type 5 Modifications
The North Carolina Environmental Management Commission is authorized to approve Type 5
Modifications after review by the Technical Review Committee, Planning Board and the City Council.
Type 5 modifications involve modifications to major watershed standards, and state law requires that
such decisions be made by the Environmental Management Commission. Regulations and standards
are eligible for modification through the Type 5 procedure only when expressly authorized by this
ordinance.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 95
30-4-11.3 Decision-making Criteria
A. Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 and Type 4 Modifications
The proposed modification must be made with regard to the purpose of the standard or regulation being
modified, this ordinance, and the Comprehensive Plan. Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 or Type 4 Modifications
may be approved if the authorized decision-making body determines that at least one of the following
criteria are met:
1. that the proposed modification will result in equal or better performance than the standard being
modified;
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 96
2. that the size, topography, or existing development of the property or of adjoining areas prevents
compliance with a standard; or
3. that a federal, state, or local law or regulation prevents compliance with the standard.
B. Perimeter Setback Requirements in RM-26 and RM-40
For townhouse and multi-family buildings located in the RM-26 and RM-40 zoning districts, the Planning
and Community Development Director may approve a Type 1 Modification allowing a reduction of up to 5
feet of the perimeter setback requirement, but in no case below 15 feet, if any of the following criteria are
met:
1. The setback being modified abuts a parcel that is in a zoning district of equal or higher density;
2. The setback being modified abuts a collector or higher classification of roadway; or
3. The setback being modified abuts land that is not occupied by a residential use.
C. Type 1 Modifications to Tree Conservation and Landscaping Requirements
1. Alternate tree conservation plans, plant materials, planting methods or reforestation may be authorized
when unreasonable or impractical situations would result from application of landscaping or tree
conservation requirements. Such situations may result from streams, natural rock formations,
topography, or other physical conditions; or from lot configuration, utility easements, unified
development design, or unusual site conditions.
2. The Planning and Community Development Director may approve an alternate plan that proposes
different plant materials or methods provided that quality, effectiveness, durability, and performance
are equivalent to that required by this section. The performance of alternate landscaping plans or tree
conservation plans must be reviewed by the Planning and Community Development Director to
determine if the alternate plan meets the intent and purpose of this section. This determination must
take into account the use of adjacent property, number of plantings, species, arrangement and
coverage, location of plantings on the lot, and the level of screening, height, spread, and canopy of the
plantings at maturity.
3. Decisions of the Planning and Community Development Director regarding alternate methods of
compliance for landscaping, tree conservation and reforestation may be appealed to the Technical
Review Committee as requests for modifications.
4. Appeals from decisions of the Technical Review Committee may be taken to the Planning Board.
(Amended by Ord. 12-114 on 10/2/12 and Ord. 14-34 on 3/18/14)
D. Type 5 Modifications
The authorized decision-making body may approve Type 5 Modifications if all of the following 3 findings
are made:
1. there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of
the ordinance. In order to determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, the
decision-making body must find that all 5 of the following conditions exist:
a. that the applicant can secure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of their
property if subject to strict compliance with the subject provisions. Merely proving that the
modification would permit a greater profit to be made from the property will not be considered
adequate to justify the granting of a modification. Moreover, the decision-making body must
consider whether the modification is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of the
ordinance that will make possible the reasonable use of the subject property;
b. the hardship results from the application of the ordinance to the property rather than from other
factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship;
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 97
c. the hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicants property, such as its size, shape, or
topography, which is different from that of neighboring property;
d. the hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates
the ordinance, or who purchases the property and then applies for relief; and
e. the hardship is peculiar to the applicants property, rather than the result of conditions that are
widespread. If other properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction, then
granting a modification would be a special privilege denied to others, and would not promote equal
justice.
2. the modification is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the ordinance and preserves its
spirit; and
3. in the granting of the modification, the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial
justice has been done. The decision-making body may not grant a modification if it finds that doing so
would in any respect impair the public health, safety, or general welfare.
30-4-11.4 Submittal Requirements
A. Modification requests must be submitted to the Planning and Community Development Department.
B. Requests must be submitted at the appropriate time, and the burden is on the applicant to demonstrate
that the criteria in 30-4-11.3 have been met.

approve, as a Type 1 Modification, an adjustment to zoning district setback requirements by up to one
foot, when a building permit has been issued and there was an unintentional error of the Engineering and
Inspections Director in verifying the location of a structure on the property, provided the purpose and
intent of the ordinance is not impaired.

H. Review Criteria
In considering a certificate of appropriateness, the Historic Preservation Commission may deny applications
for work that would be incongruous with the special character of the district.
I. Dimensional Regulations and Exceptions
1. Structures within a historic district overlay must comply with the requirements of the underlying zoning
district and this ordinance. Structures erected in a historic district overlay may use the contextual
street setback of structures on the same side of the street in accordance with 30-7-3.4(F)1)
2. All street setback (except as provided in subsection 1) above), interior setback, building coverage, and
height requirements shall comply with applicable zoning regulations unless a special exception is
approved by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with 30-4-13. The special exception may be
approved only if the Historic Preservation Commission finds that granting such an exception meets the
intent of the Historic District Program Manual and Design Guidelines and makes a recommendation for
approval.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 110
3. Where the Historic Preservation Commission finds that the number of off-street parking spaces and/or
design standards for parking lots specified by this ordinance would render the site incompatible with
the Historic District Design Guidelines , it may recommend to the Board of Adjustment that a special
exception to the provisions of the off-street parking requirements and/or design standards be granted.
The Board of Adjustment may approve a special exception authorizing modifications to off-street
parking standards if it finds:
a. that a lesser standard does not create problems due to increased on-street or other parking; and
b. that a lesser standard does not create a threat to the public safety.
4. Unless otherwise authorized by the certificate of appropriateness, all off-street parking areas must be
located to the rear of the principal building; however, parking in existing driveways and previously
approved parking areas is exempt from this requirement.
J. Duration of Certificate of Appropriateness
1. A Certificate of Appropriateness expires 12 months after the date of issuance if the work authorized by
the Certificate has not commenced. If, after commencement, the work is discontinued for a period of
12 months, the Certificate immediately expires.
2. A certificate of appropriateness authorizing demolition expires 12 months after the authorization date
set by the Historic Preservation Commission if the work has not commenced. If, after commencement,
the demolition work is discontinued for a period of 12 months, the Certificate immediately expires.
3. Upon expiration of a certificate of appropriateness, no work authorized by the Certificate (including
demolition) may be performed until a new Certificate of Appropriateness has been approved in
accordance with this section.
K. Appeal
Appeals of decisions by the Historic Preservation Commission may be taken to the Board of Adjustment in

(Amended by Ord. 12-114 on 10/2/12)
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 115
30-4-13.2 Authority to File
An application for a variance must be signed by the owner of the subject property.
30-4-13.3 Filing
An application for a variance must be prepared in accordance with the common review procedures of 30-4-1
and submitted to the Planning and Community Development Department at least 30 days before the Board of
Adjustment meeting where the application will be heard.
(Amended by Ord. 13-156 on 12/17/13)
30-4-13.4 Board of AdjustmentDecision
A. The Board of Adjustment must hold a public hearing on all variance applications. Notice of the hearing
must be provided in accordance with 30-4-1.5.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 116
B. Following the close of the public hearing, the Board of Adjustment must take action on the application in
consideration of the General Variance Findings of Fact required by 30-4-13.5. The Board may grant
approval of a variance application subject to certain conditions or restrictions in accordance with 30-4-
13.7.
30-4-13.5 General Variance Findings of Fact
A. In order to grant a variance request, the Board must make the following findings of fact:
1. Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It shall not be
necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the
property.
2. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or
topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from
conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance.
3. The hardship did not result from actions taken by that applicant or the property owner. The act of
purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a
variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.
4. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the ordinance, such that
public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.
There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that would result from carrying out the strict
letter of this ordinance.
B. Any variance granted by the Board of Adjustment must be the minimum variance required for reasonable
use of the land, building, or structure. The fact that property may be utilized for greater profit, however, is
not considered adequate to justify the granting of a variance.
C. Neither the nonconforming use of lands, buildings, or structures in the same zoning district; nor the
permitted use of lands, buildings, or structures in other zoning districts; nor personal circumstances may
be considered as grounds for the issuance of a variance. Furthermore, mere financial hardship does not
constitute grounds for the granting of a variance.
(Amended by Ord. 13-122 on 9/17/13)
30-4-13.6 Flood Damage Prevention Variance
A. Authority
The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements
of the flood damage prevention provisions of this ordinance.
B. Appeal and Variance Considerations
In passing upon such applications, the Board of Adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all
relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and:
1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such
damage on the individual owner;
4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
5. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed
use;
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 117
6. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
7. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program
for that area;
8. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
9. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters, and
the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;
10. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance
and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges; and
11. The effect that granting the appeal or variance would have on the citys eligibility for federal flood
insurance. In addition, if the request is for a functionally dependent facility, the Board of Adjustment
shall consider the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location.
C. Written Report and Additional Conditions
A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be submitted with the application for a
variance.
D. Granting of Variances
1. Variances may be granted for:
a. The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the determination that the proposed repair
or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
b. Functionally dependent facilities provided such facilities are protected by methods that minimize
flood damages.
c. Any other type of development provided it meets the requirements stated in this section.
2. Variances shall not be granted when the variance will cause the structure to be in violation of other
federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances.
3. Variances shall not be granted within any designated floodway or non-encroachment area if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
4. Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
5. Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit approval.
6. Variances shall only be granted upon:
a. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
b. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, creation of a nuisance, fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
7. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference
between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a
written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation up to $25 per $100 of insurance coverage. Such
notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 118
8. The Floodplain Administrator, hereinafter referred to as the Water Resources Director, shall maintain
the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and the State of North Carolina upon request.
9. A variance may be issued for solid waste disposal facilities, hazardous waste management facilities,
salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities that are located in special flood hazard areas or future
conditions flood hazard areas provided that all of the following conditions are met:
a. The use serves a critical need in the community.
b. No feasible location exists for the use outside the special flood hazard area or future conditions
flood hazard area.
c. The reference level of any structure is elevated or flood-proofed to at least the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
d. The use complies with all other applicable federal, state and local laws.
e. The city has notified the Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Crime Control and Public
Safety of its intention to grant a variance at least 30 days prior to granting the variance.
30-4-13.7 Conditions
In granting a variance, the Board of Adjustment may impose conditions deemed necessary to advance the
purposes and intent of this ordinance, provided that such conditions are directly related to the impacts of the
proposed use and are roughly proportional to those anticipated impacts.
A. A variance granted subject to a condition may continue only so long as there is compliance with the
condition.
B. Violation or invalidation of conditions required for approval, for any reason, will be deemed a violation of
this ordinance.
C. In the event that any such condition is held invalid, for any reason, such holding has the effect of
invalidating the variance granted and renders the variance null and void.
D. If a violation or invalidation of a condition of a variance occurs, the Engineering and Inspections Director
may revoke the Certificate of Occupancy.
30-4-13.8 Duration of Approval
The Board may specify a time duration within which construction, operation, or installation must commence.
Unless otherwise specified, construction, operation, or installation must start within 12 months of the date of
issuance of a variance or it becomes void. If construction or operation is started within the specified time
period, the variance approval continues in force so long as the affected building, operation, or installation
remains.

Commentary: For the NPDES Phase II Rule Changes (Water Quantity), Stormwater Management Plans
(SWMP) submitted prior to June 1, 2009 that received final Technical Review Committee (TRC) approval before
December 31, 2009 retain exemption eligibility. Since the development shown on the plan is preliminary and not
for construction purposes, prior to any development the applicant shall submit a site plan for TRC review and
approval. With the legislative extension of plan approvals the City recognizes that applicants must submit a
detailed site plan for TRC review and secure TRC approval prior to December 31, 2013, in order to maintain the
grandfathering depicted on those SWMPs..

(Amended by Ord. 10-161 on 12/1/10)
30-4-19 Completion of Improvements
A final plat may not be approved until:
30-4-19.1 all required improvements have been completed and installed; or
30-4-19.2 a performance guarantee has been provided in accordance with 30-4-20 and all
departmental policies and procedures regarding performance guarantees have been met.
30-4-20 Performance Guarantees
30-4-20.1 Agreement and Guarantee
In lieu of requiring the completion, installation, and dedication of all required improvements prior to final plat
approval or issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy, the city may enter into an agreement with the developer
whereby the developer agrees to complete all required improvements within a specified period of time. Once
the agreement is signed by the developer and the required financial guarantee is provided, the final plat may
be approved or the Certificate of Occupancy may be issued if all other requirements of this ordinance are met.
To secure this agreement, the developer must provide one or more of the following financial guarantees to
cover the costs of the uncompleted improvements:
A. Cash, Irrevocable Letter of Credit, or Equivalent Security
1. The developer must deposit cash, an irrevocable letter of credit, or other instrument readily convertible
into cash at face value either with the city or in escrow with a financial institution. The amount of
deposit must be adequate to cover at least the entire probable cost of installing all uncompleted
improvements, as approved by the city.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 134
2. If cash or other instrument is deposited in escrow with a financial institution, an agreement between
the financial institution and the developer must be filed with the city guaranteeing the following:
a. that the escrow account will be held in trust until released by the city and may not be used or
pledged by the developer for any other matter during the term of the escrow; and
b. that in case of a failure on the part of the developer to complete required improvements covered
by the guarantee, the financial institution must, upon notification by the city, immediately pay the
funds deemed necessary by the city to complete the improvements up to the full balance of the
escrow account, or deliver to the city any other instruments fully endorsed or otherwise made
payable in full to the city.
B. Surety Bond
1. The developer must obtain a surety bond from a surety bonding company authorized to issue surety
bonds in North Carolina.
2. The bond must be payable to the city and must be in an amount covering the entire probable cost of
installing all uncompleted improvements, as approved by the city.
30-4-20.2 Duration of Performance Guarantees
The duration of a performance guarantee must be of a reasonable period to allow for completion and
acceptance of improvements. In no case may the duration of the performance guarantee exceed 2 years,
unless the guarantee is extended with the consent of the city. The city may release a portion or all of any
financial guarantee posted as the improvements are completed and approved by the city. All infrastructure
necessary to serve off-site development must be completed before final release of the financial guarantee.
30-4-20.3 Default
A. Public Improvements
Developments with public improvements that are not completed and accepted at least 30 days before the
expiration of the performance guarantee will be considered to be in default. Upon default the surety
bonding company or the financial institution holding the escrow account must, if requested by the city, pay
to the city all or any portion of the bond or escrow fund in an amount deemed necessary by the city to
complete the improvements. Upon payment, the city must expend the funds, or portion of the funds, to
complete all or any portion of the required improvements. The city must return any funds not spent in
completing the improvements. Default on a project does not release the developer from liability and
responsibility for completion of the required improvements.
B. Private Improvements (engineered stormwater controls or other improvements to remain
privately owned)
Developments with private improvements that are not completed and accepted at least 30 days before the
expiration of the performance guarantee will be considered to be in default. Upon default the surety
bonding company or the financial institution holding the escrow account must, if requested by the city, pay
to the city all or any portion of the bond or escrow fund in an amount deemed necessary by the city to
have the improvements completed. Upon payment, the city shall require completion of all required
improvements and shall use such funds or portion thereof from the bond or escrow account to reimburse
costs for all or any portion of the required improvements the city must return any funds not spent in
completing the improvements. Default on a project does not release the original subdivider or developer
and all subsequent subdividers and developers from liability and responsibility for completion of the
required improvements.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 135
30-4-20.4 Improper Release of Financial Guarantee
If the city releases a financial guarantee through error, that error does not release the developer from
responsibility for the completion of all improvements required by this ordinance.
30-4-20.5 Fee in Lieu of Required Sidewalk Installation
Where the installation of sidewalk is required by an ordinance of the city, and the Transportation Director
determines that installation at the time of development would conflict with a city, state, or federal roadway
project planned or programmed to begin construction within 4 years, the developer must submit a fee in lieu
of such installation. Fees submitted in lieu of required sidewalk installation must be in an amount of the entire
estimated cost of concrete and concrete installation for sidewalks and wheelchair ramps, based on current
prices as determined by the Transportation Director. All fees collected by the city pursuant to this subsection
must be deposited in a city fund to be used for construction of sidewalks on the site, or in the street right-ofway
abutting the site, for which the fee is collected. Use of submitted funds to construct sidewalks must be
coordinated with the appropriate phase of the conflicting roadway project.
(Amended by Ord. 10-161 on 12/1/10)
30-4-21 Oversizing and Extension of Improvements
The city is authorized to require installation of oversized utilities and the extension of utilities to adjacent

dedication, as authorized in Section 136-96 of the NCGS, as an alternate to 30-4-22.
30-4-25 Site Specific Development Plans
30-4-25.1 Purpose
The purpose of this section is to implement the provisions of Section 160A-385.1 of the North Carolina General
Statutes for the establishment of a statutory zoning vested right upon the approval of a Site Specific
Development Plan
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 136
30-4-25.2 Establishment of a Zoning Vested Right
A. A zoning vested right is deemed established upon the valid approval, or conditional approval, by the
Planning Board or City Council, as applicable, of a Site Specific Development Plan.
B. In approving a Site Specific Development Plan, the Planning Board or City Council may impose additional
terms and conditions as deemed reasonably necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
C. Site Specific Development Plans requiring a variance prior to final approval may not receive zoning vested
right status until the necessary variance has been obtained.
D. The establishment of a zoning vested right does not preclude the application of overlay zoning that
imposes additional requirements that do not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or other
ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land use
regulation by the city. These may include, but are not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and
mechanical codes. All otherwise applicable new or amended regulations become effective with respect to
property that is subject to a Site Specific Development Plan upon the expiration or termination of the
zoning vested right in accordance with this section.
E. A zoning vested right is not a personal right, but attaches to and runs with the applicable property. After
approval of a Site Specific Development Plan, all successors to the original landowner are entitled to
exercise such right as long as the zoning vested right remains valid.
F. A zoning vested right only protects the landowner from zoning amendments that affect the allowable type
or intensity of use of property. However, it does not protect the landowner from zoning amendments that
do not affect the allowable type or intensity of use of property or from nonzoning amendments to this
ordinance.
30-4-25.3 Approval Procedure
A. Application
An application for Site Specific Development Plan approval must be processed in accordance with this
section and must be considered by the Planning Board or City Council, as applicable, for the specific type
of zoning or land use approval being considered.
1. In order for a zoning vested right to be established upon approval of a Site Specific Development Plan,
the applicant must indicate at the time of application, on a form provided by the Planning and
Community Development Department, that a zoning vested right is being sought.
2. An application must be accompanied by a Site Specific Development Plan. The Planning and
Community Development Director or Technical Review Committee, as specified in 30-4-15.2(B) must
approve the Site Specific Development Plan for submission before it may be considered by the
Planning Board. The Planning Board must consider the Site Specific Development Plan at a regularly
scheduled meeting not less than 24 days after the Planning and Community Development Director or
Technical Review Committee has approved it for submission.
3. Each site plan or other document referring to a Site Specific Development Plan must contain the
following notation:
Approval of this plan establishes a zoning vested right under NCGS 160A-385.1. Unless terminated at an earlier
date, the zoning vested right shall be valid until ______________________.
B. Notification
Notification must be provided in accordance with 30-4-1.4.
C. Public Hearing
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 137
The Planning Board must hold a public hearing on the application. The Planning and Community
Development Director must present the application to the Planning Board, together with the Planning and
Community Development Directors or Technical Review Committees recommendations.
D. Continuance
The Planning Board or City Council may continue a zoning vested right request for up to 2 months
provided the reason for the continuance is stated in the motion to continue. Nothing in this section
prohibits a continuance from being granted for a greater period of time provided it is mutually agreed
upon by all parties concerned. Upon failure of the Planning Board to act upon a request following all
proper continuances, or if no action is taken, the petitioner may take the zoning vested right application to
the City Council without a recommendation from the Planning Board. Upon failure of the City Council to act
on a request following all proper continuances, the request is deemed to be denied.
E. Voting
A concurring affirmative vote by at least a majority of those members present and voting is required for
the Planning Board to approve a zoning vested right application.
F. Appeals
If a zoning vested right request has been denied or granted conditional approval, the applicant may appeal
to the City Council in accordance with 30-4-1.6.
G. Action by City Council
The City Council may hear only applications that have first been heard by the Planning Board as provided
for in this section. Upon receipt of proper appeals, the City Council must hold a public hearing. After
completion of the public hearing, the City Council must take such lawful action as it deems advisable.
H. Subsequent Reviews and Approvals
Following approval or conditional approval of a Site Specific Development Plan, nothing in this section
exempts such a plan from subsequent reviews and approvals to ensure compliance with the original
approval.
30-4-25.4 Changes or Amendments
All changes or amendments to an approved Site Specific Development Plan which affect the allowable type or
intensity of use must be resubmitted as a new application.
30-4-25.5 Duration
A. A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this section remains vested for a period of up to 2
years. This vesting period may not be extended by any changes or amendments to a Site Specific
Development Plan.
B. Upon issuance of a building permit, the expiration provisions of Section 160A-418 of the North Carolina
General Statutes and the revocation provisions of Section 160A-422 of the North Carolina General Statutes
apply, except that a building permit will not expire or be revoked because of the running of time while a
zoning vested right under this section remains valid.
30-4-25.6 Termination
A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this section terminates:
A. At the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building
permit applications have been filed;
B. With the written consent of the affected landowner;
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 138
C. Upon findings by the City Council, by ordinance after notice and a public hearing, that natural or manmade
hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat
to the public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the Site Specific
Development Plan;
D. Upon payment to the affected landowner of compensation for all costs, expenses, and other losses
incurred by the landowner, including, but not limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all
architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other consultants fees incurred after approval by the city,
together with interest at the legal rate until paid. Compensation will not include any diminution in the value
of the property which is caused by such action;
E. Upon findings by the City Council, by ordinance after notice and a hearing, that the landowner or his
representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations which
made a difference in the approval of the Site Specific Development Plan; or
F. Upon enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or regulation that precludes development as
contemplated in the Site Specific Development Plan, in which case the City Council may modify the
affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in state or federal law has a fundamental effect on the
plan, by ordinance after notice and a hearing.
30-4-25.7 Violations
Any violation of a term or condition involved in the granting of a zoning vested right will be treated the same
as a violation of this ordinance and is subject to the same remedies and penalties as any such violation in
accordance with Article 5. In addition, the Planning Board may, after public hearing, revoke any zoning vested
right for failure to abide by any such term or condition.

properties subject to the petition has been established under Section 160A-385.1 or Section 153A-344.1 of the
North Carolina General Statutes. A statement that declares that no zoning vested right has been established
under Section 160A-385.1 or Section 153A-344.1 of the North Carolina General Statutes, or the failure to sign
a statement declaring whether or not a zoning vested right has been established, is binding on the landowner
and any potential zoning vested right will be terminated.

and manufacturing activities. The district is established for the purpose of providing appropriate locations and
development regulations for uses which may have significant environmental impacts or require special
measures to ensure compatibility with adjoining properties.
30-6-7 Special District Intent Statements
30-6-7.1 AG, Agricultural District
The AG, Agricultural District is primarily intended to accommodate uses of an agricultural nature including farm
residences and farm tenant housing. It also accommodates scattered non-farm residences on large tracts of
land. It is not intended for major residential subdivisions. The district is established for the following purposes:
A. To preserve the use of land for agricultural, forest, and open space purposes until urban development is
enabled by the extension of essential urban services;
B. To provide for the orderly transition to urban uses by preventing premature conversion of farmland;
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 167
C. To discourage any use that would create premature or extraordinary public infrastructure and service
demands; and
D. To discourage scattered agricultural related commercial and industrial land uses.
30-6-7.2 PUD, Planned Unit Development Districts
A. PUD, Planned Unit Development districts are intended to allow a diverse mixture of residential and/or
nonresidential uses and structures that function as cohesive and unified projects. The districts encourage
innovation by allowing flexibility in permitted use, design, and layout requirements in accordance with a
Unified Development Plan. This should provide benefits by providing opportunities for employment and
services closer to residences.
B. Planned Unit Development districts are intended to reduce housing and infrastructure costs by promoting
smaller lot sizes and the corresponding linear footage of streets, water lines, and sanitary and storm
sewers. This should reduce the amount of site preparation grading.
C. Planned Unit Development districts are primarily intended in areas which have underutilized or vacant land
near major streets and utility lines, or where the applicant proposes a development that is compatible with
the surrounding area (natural and built) but may require modifications to the basic standards of the
underlying zoning district. This should protect water quality and preserve wildlife habitats and other
natural features such as streams, lakes, wetlands, and trees.
30-6-7.3 TN, Traditional Neighborhood District
The TN, Traditional Neighborhood district is intended to establish or strengthen compact neighborhoods with a
distinct sense of place and character that are limited in size and oriented toward pedestrian activity. Projects
should encourage a desirable mix of residential, commercial, and civic uses that are built in close proximity to
each other along a network of interconnecting streets and blocks; resulting in a coordinated transportation
system with appropriately designed facilities for pedestrian, bicycle, public transportation, and conventional
vehicles.
30-6-8 Conditional District Intent Statement
Conditional districts are primarily intended to allow for the zoning and development of property, subject to
both underlying district standards and additional conditions, to help development fit better with the site and
surrounding properties.
30-6-9 Overlay District Intent Statements
Overlay district regulations contain standards applicable to certain areas in addition to base district zoning
standards in order to help development fit better with the site and surrounding properties. Where specified,
overlay district standards modify base district standards.
30-6-9.1 ACO, Activity Center Overlay
A. Activity centers are existing or anticipated future concentrations of uses that function as destinations or
hubs of activity for the surrounding area. Typically located in areas of mixed use shown on the Generalized
Future Land Use Map, activity centers are intended to include features such as a mix of higher intensity
uses (residential, retail, office, etc.), compact development patterns, urban open spaces, pedestrian and
transit linkages. Activity centers must be served by a network of alternative transportation options,
including walking routes, bike lanes, and rail (if available).
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 168
B. The purpose of the ACO, Activity Center Overlay district is to promote the development of lands in areas
designated as activity centers on the Generalized Future Land Use Map in accordance with the
Comprehensive Plan and the adopted activity center master plan if one has been developed for the specific
activity center. The regulations allow for greater variety of uses, flexibility in site planning and
development regulations, and intensity of land use than may be allowed in the underlying zoning district.
30-6-9.2 AO, Airport Overlay
The -AO Airport overlay district is intended to be limited to industrial and other uses that are compatible
with airport operations, and to limit residential uses to very low densities near the Piedmont Triad
International Airport in order to minimize the negative effects of aircraft noise on homes. The overlay district
also prohibits the erection of structures which would, by virtue of their height, interfere with operations at the
airport.
30-6-9.3 CBO, Central Business Overlay

The DDO, Downtown Design Overlay is established to provide for compatibility throughout downtown and
between higher intensity development in the central business district and lower intensity development
surrounding the downtown. It is the intent of the -DDO to encourage intense development and pedestrian
activity in the downtown area that enhances, respects and builds upon historic contexts and promotes visual
harmony, and provides for appropriate transitions to surrounding neighborhoods through clear, flexible
guidance.
(Amended by Ord. 10-133 on 9/7/10)
30-6-9.5 HDO, Historic District Overlay
The -HDO, Historic district overlay is intended to protect, safeguard, and conserve the heritage of the
community; promote the sound and orderly preservation of historic areas as a whole, and of the individual
properties therein, which embody important elements of social, economic, political, or architectural history for
the education, pleasure, and enrichment of all citizens; and stabilize and increase property values within
historic areas.
30-6-9.6 MHO, Manufactured Housing Overlay
The -MHO, Manufactured Housing overlay district is intended to help provide affordable housing opportunities
for residents in residential areas by allowing for the use of manufactured dwellings; establish requirements
designed to insure compatibility in exterior appearance between manufactured dwellings and other singlefamily
dwellings that have been or might be constructed on adjacent or nearby lots; and protect property
values and preserve the character and integrity of the community or individual neighborhoods within the
community.
30-6-9.7 NCO-Neighborhood Conservation Overlay
The NCO, Neighborhood Conservation overlay district establishes regulations to enhance natural, economic,
and architectural resources unique to specific areas of the city while protecting neighborhoods from
incompatible development. The overlay district regulations are intended to:
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 169
A. encourage development, redevelopment, and/or public projects that are consistent with a neighborhood's
livability, architectural character, and reinvestment potential; and
B. provide a means to modify zoning regulations and establish design standards for specific areas of the city
while facilitating compatible development or redevelopment and protecting neighborhoods from
incompatible development.
30-6-9.8 PSO, Pedestrian Scale Overlay
The PSO, Pedestrian Scale overlay district is intended to accommodate neighborhood serving commercial,
office and residential uses as infill development along the thoroughfares. Standards encourage consistency
between new development and existing development within built up areas and help provide safe, walkable,
attractive, pedestrian-oriented areas.
30-6-9.9 SCO, Scenic Corridor Overlay
The -SCO, Scenic Corridor overlay district is intended to preserve and enhance the appearance and operational
characteristics of certain designated roadways; and address development issues of special concern with

(Amended by Ord. 11-143 on 7/19/11)
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 170
Article 7. District Standards
30-7-1 Measurements and Computation
30-7-1.1 Development
A. Development Area
The minimum development area is the total area of contiguous land and water bodies under single
ownership or under multiple ownership proposed for development as a single unit or recorded as a single
unit. A development does not need to be developed all at once to satisfy the development area
requirement.
B. Development Width
The minimum development width is the distance from one side of a tract to the opposing side of a tract
measured at edge of the right of way.
30-7-1.2 Separation Distances
A. Property
Property separation is measured as the horizontal distance between property lines, measured along the
shortest line that can be drawn between the subject property lines.
B. Property (along the street)
Property separation along the street is measured as the horizontal distance between property lines,
measured along the shortest route that follows the centerline of the street right-of-way between the
nearest property lines of the subject properties.
C. Use
Use separation is measured as the horizontal distance between buildings occupied by the subject use,
measured along the shortest line that can be drawn between the exterior walls.
D. Establishment
Establishment separation is measured as the horizontal distance between the outer limits of the floor space
occupied by the subject use and the lot occupied by the protected use or the referenced zoning district
boundary, measured along the shortest line that can be drawn between the subject areas.
Commentary: establishment separation is intended to address uses that occupy floor
space in a multi-tenant building, in which case a common (interior) wall may sometimes
represent the appropriate point of measurement.
E. Building
Building separation is measured as the horizontal distance between buildings, measured along the shortest
line that can be drawn between the exterior walls.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 171
Figure 7-1, Separation Measurement
30-7-1.3 Lot Measurement
A. Lot Area
The lot area is the total area circumscribed by the boundaries of a lot, excluding street right-of-way,
except that, for purposes of computing lot area to satisfy minimum lot area requirements, the following
rules apply:
1. If intersecting street rights-of-way at a corner lot are connected by a right-of-way chord or radius, the
area lying between the chord or radius and the projections of the 2 street right-of-way lines to a point
of intersection are included in the lot area calculation.
2. If a street right-of-way line cannot be determined, or if the street is a private street, a line parallel to
and 25 feet from the center of the traveled portion of the street will be used as the boundary for lot
area calculation.
3. For lots abutting collector or local street rights-of-way wider than required by this ordinance, the extra
right-of-way on each side will be counted toward the minimum lot area of the abutting lot on the same
side.
4. For additional lot area standards applying to multi-family development, see 30-8-10.1(H).
B. Lot Width
The lot width is the distance from side lot line to side lot line measured at the minimum front street
setback (parallel to the front property line). For lots along circular turnarounds, the lot width may be
measured at a front street setback of up to 50 feet from the street right-of-way. On circular turnarounds,
the point where lot width is measured is considered the minimum building line.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 172
Figure 7-2, Minimum Lot Width/Determination of Minimum Building Line
C. Lot Depth
The lot depth is the distance measured at the deepest part of the lot along the perpendicular bisector from
the front lot line to the rear lot line.
Figure 7-3, Measurement of Lot Depth
30-7-1.4 Setbacks
A. Street Setbacks
Street setbacks are computed by the horizontal distance from the existing or proposed (whichever is
further from the centerline) street right-of-way line to the nearest part of the applicable building, structure,
sign, or activity, measured perpendicularly to the line. The future street right-of-way line will be
determined by the Street Design Standards Manual using the street centerline or other appropriate
reference point which satisfies the intent of the street design standards and its roadway classification.
Determination of any future street right of way line shall only apply to those streets that have been
identified on the Thoroughfare Plan or Collector Street Plan as requiring improvements or widening.
1. Front
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 173
a. Any setback from a street right-of-way line other than a side street setback. A through lot has 2
front street setbacks. The property owner shall designate the front and side setback on a corner
lot.
b. Single Family Detached Dwellings
Where 50% or more of the lots on the same block face as the subject lot are occupied by single
family detached dwellings, buildings on the subject lot must comply with the minimum street
setback determined by calculating the average (mean) setback that exists on the 2 lots on either
side of the subject lot (total of 4).
i. If one or more of the lots included in the average calculation is vacant, the vacant lot will be
deemed to have a setback equal to the minimum street setback of the underlying zoning
district.
ii. Lots with buildings oriented to a different street than the subject lot or that are separated from
the subject lot by a street or alley may not be used in computing the average street setback.
iii. When the subject lot is a corner lot, the average street setback will be computed on the basis
of the nearest 2 lots occupied by buildings oriented to the same street as the subject lot.
iv. When the subject lot abuts a corner lot occupied by a building oriented to the same street, the
average street setback will be computed on the basis of the abutting corner lot and the
nearest 2 lots occupied by buildings oriented to the same street as the subject lot.
v. For lots where the calculated average street setback does not result in achieving a buildable
area equal to or greater than the percentage of building coverage for that zoning district, the
Planning Director may approve a Type 1 Modification (see 30-4-11) as follows:
a. The rear setback is to be first reduced to 15 feet;
b. Then the street setback may be reduced by 10% or 5 feet, whichever is greater.
c. Upon the granting of a modification to this section, the Planning Director shall notify the
owners of property abutting the subject lot and each lot used in determining the average
street setback.
vi. Where 50% or more of the lots on the same block face as the subject lot are not occupied by
single family detached dwellings, buildings on the subject lot must comply with the minimum
street setback for the underlying zoning district.
vii. Application Requirements
In addition to any other application requirements, applicants subject to the average (mean)
setback must submit detailed plans showing building footprints for existing buildings in the
area. These plans must be annotated with building setbacks, and other information that the
Planning Director may require to determine compliance with these requirements.
2. Side
Side street setback is a required street setback that is not a front street setback.
3. Thoroughfare
Thoroughfare (major or minor) setback is the setback required for any portion of a lot abutting a
thoroughfare right of way line.
4. Street Setback Reduction
a. Nonresidential Uses and Multifamily Dwellings
Where 50% or more of the lots on the same block face as the subject lot are occupied by buildings
containing nonresidential uses or multifamily dwellings with less than the minimum street setback
requirement of the subject zoning district, buildings on the subject lot may comply with the
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 174
minimum street setback requirement of the district or the average setback requirement calculated
in accordance with 30-7-1.4(A)1)b).
B. Interior Setbacks
Interior setback is measured from any property line not alongside a street.
1. Rear
A setback from an interior property line lying on the opposite side of the lot from the front street
setback.
2. Side
Any interior property line setback other than a rear setback.
Figure 7-4, Determination of Setbacks
C. Encroachments into Required Setbacks
The following are allowed in required setbacks provided that compliance is maintained with the provisions
of Section 16-8 of the City Code (Obstructions to Cross-Visibility at Intersections):

A. General
Single-family detached housing is a separate, detached building designed for and occupied exclusively by
one family.
B. Cluster
The objective of cluster development is to allow smaller lots than normally permitted in the zoning district
and to place land which would otherwise have been included in private lots into public dedication or
common elements for open space. Cluster development complies with the maximum density standards of
the base zone but requires that at least 15% of the tract be set aside as common open space. See 30-7-
3.3, Cluster Development for development requirements.
30-7-2.2 Traditional House
A traditional house is a single-family detached dwelling. Automobile parking areas and garages are located to
the rear of the property, accessed from an alley, and are subordinate in character to the primary structure. It
has private yards on each side of the building. See 30-8-10.1(L) for additional use standards.
30-7-2.3 Zero Lot Line
Zero lot line is a modified form of single-family detached with alternate dimensional requirements that allow a
dwelling unit to have one side setback of zero feet. The unit has a single side yard on one side comprising the
equivalent of 2 side yards of a single-family detached house. See 30-8-10.1(N) for additional use standards.
30-7-2.4 Twin Home
A twin home is a dwelling type consisting of 2 attached single-family dwelling units, each occupying its own
conventional lot and conveyed by deed in fee simple, connected along a common party wall with no interior
circulation between the 2 dwelling units.

J. Interior Setback Standards for Townhouse and Multi-family Buildings
1. Townhouse Setback from Project Perimeter
a. Along the perimeter of a development the minimum interior setback is established by the number
of units in that portion of the building facing the lot line (as per Table 7-10 below) or 20% of the
length of that portion of the building facing the lot line, whichever is greater. (See the dimensional
tables in 30-7-3.2(D) through 30-7-3.2(G) for the maximum number of units that may be attached
as one building in each zoning district).

2. Multi-family Setback from Project Perimeter
a. Setback Abutting an R- Residential District or any Single-Family Dwelling
The side and rear yard determinations will be based on the orientation of each proposed building
to the adjoining project property line, except in a single building planned multi-family development
where side and rear yards will be determined based upon the configuration of the lot. If the angle
formed by the property line and the front or rear façade of the building is greater than 45 degrees,
the area between the building and the property line will be treated as a side yard. The minimum

interior setback of zero, the minimum setback is 5 feet.
ii. In all other RM-districts the side and rear yard determinations will be based on the orientation
of each proposed building to the adjoining project property line, except in a single building
planned multi-family development where side and rear yards will be determined based upon
the configuration of the lot. If the angle formed by the property line and the front or rear
façade of the building is greater than 45 degrees, the area between the building and the
property line will be treated as a side yard. The minimum setbacks shall be as follows:
a. Side Yard
A setback of 15 feet plus one foot for each foot of building height above 50 feet shall be
provided along the side yard.
b. Rear Yard
A setback of 20 feet plus one foot for each foot of building height above 50 feet shall be

(Amended by Ord. 11-81 on 5/17/11 and Ord. 13-102 on 7/16/13)
30-7-3.4 Contextual Infill Development Option
A. Purpose
These standards are intended to encourage reinvestment in existing neighborhoods that complements the
neighborhoods established character.
B. Description
The contextual infill development option may be used at the subject property owner's election to guide
construction in already built up areas to ensure that new development or redevelopment complements the
established character of the neighborhood. When these contextual infill development standards are in
conflict with the dimensional standards of the base zoning district, these contextual standards govern.
Figure 7-14, Contextual Infill Development
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 197
C. Applicability
The contextual infill development standards may be used in the following situations:
1. R- Residential Single-family Districts
In single-family residential zoning districts, contextual infill development standards may be used on
any project that is less than 2 acres in area and is located on a block where more than 50% of the lots
on the same block face (all the lots on the same side of a street) or 75% of the lots on the subject
block face and the opposing block face (the other side of the street) are occupied by existing singlefamily
dwellings.
2. RM- Residential Multi-family Districts
In multi-family residential zoning districts, contextual infill development standards may be used on any
site that is less than 2 acres in area.
3. Date of Establishment of Lots
The lots to be built upon in accordance with these contextual infill development standards must have
been lawfully established before January 1, 1960.
4. Nonresidential Development
The contextual infill development standards may not be used for nonresidential development.
D. Lot Area
1. For single-family projects (single-family detached, traditional, and zero lot line), there is no minimum
lot area under the contextual infill development option, provided all other standards are met.
2. For all other residential projects, the minimum lot area for the respective zoning district applies.
E. Lot Width
1. For single-family projects, the minimum lot width requirement under the contextual infill development
option is the smaller of:
a. The average width of the adjacent lots fronting on the same block face; or
b. The median of the widths for all other lots fronting on the same block face.
2. For all other projects, the minimum lot width requirement for the respective zoning district applies.
F. Setbacks
1. Street Setback
a. Nonresidential Uses and Multifamily Dwellings
Minimum setback requirements may be established in accordance with 30-7-1.4(A)4)a).
b. Single Family Detached Dwellings
Minimum setback requirements shall be established in accordance with 30-7-1.4(A)1)b).
2. Side Setbacks
a. In R districts, the minimum contextual setback is equal to the side setback that exists on the
abutting lot, provided that no side setback may be less than 5 feet, and no setback is required to
exceed 25% of the subject lot width.
b. In RM districts, the side setbacks of the underlying zoning district apply.
G. Buildings
1. Building Coverage
Building coverage requirements shall be the same as apply to the subject zoning district. In cases
where the building coverage on abutting lots is higher than the building coverage standard for the
district, the Planning and Community Development Director may approve a Type 1 Modification (see
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 198
30-4-11) allowing an increase in building coverage of up to the average building coverage of the lots
on either side of the subject lot. The applicant must submit documentation of the building coverage in
a form approved by the Planning and Community Development Director.
2. Main Entrance
Every principal structure using the contextual infill development option must have a main entrance that
fronts on a public street.
3. Parking, Garages, and Access
a. Contextual infill developments resulting in 4 or more dwelling units on a parcel must locate on-site
parking to the side or rear of the principal structure.
b. Parking areas are prohibited in the front or side street setback when the contextual infill
development standards are used.
c. Where access from an alley is available, access to garages and other off-street parking areas must
be taken from that alley.
d. When provided, attached and detached garages must be located behind the front building line.
Garages may be positioned as follows:
Figure 7-15, Design Alternative
Design Alternative Example
Position the garage or other accessory building a minimum of 10 feet behind the front
wall plane of the principal building; or
Orient the garage door perpendicular to the street
H. Additional Standards
If the contextual infill development is in an overlay district, additional standards may apply.
I. Application Requirements
In addition to any other application requirements, applicants using the contextual infill option must submit
detailed plans showing building footprints for existing buildings in the context area. These plans must be
annotated with lot widths, building widths, building setbacks, and other information that the Planning and
Community Development Director may require to determine compliance with these requirements.

(Amended by Ord. 14-13 on 1/21/14)
30-7-4.2 General Development Standards and Guidelines in the MUDistricts
The following regulations apply to all development in an MU- District
A. Residential Component
Commentary: There is no maximum residential density limit. However all dimensional
requirements and parking requirements must be met. Certain requirements may be modified as
provided by this ordinance.
1. At least 30% of the total gross floor area of the project must be designed and constructed for
residential occupancy.
2. Residential units may be located on the first floor of a mixed use building provided there is at least
1,500 square feet of nonresidential floor area on the first floor and the building is at least 2 stories.
3. Up to 50% of the residential component requirement may be satisfied by existing residential units
located within ¼ mile (convenient, safe walking distance) of the proposed building. Off-site dwelling
units are calculated at a rate of 1,500 square feet per dwelling unit. To be included in the calculation,
the following conditions must be met:
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 201
a. Clearly defined pedestrian connections must be provided between the residential units and the
proposed development; and
b. Overnight accommodations may not be considered residential units.
c. The residential component may not exceed 70% of the gross floor area;
4. The preceding residential component limitation does not apply to vertical mixed-use buildings that are
at least 4 stories in height if the street frontage of the first floor is entirely occupied by eating and
drinking establishments, personal and professional services or retail sales and service uses. However,
penetrations for access to parking, utilities and the residential component are allowed.
5. For development projects smaller than 3 acres, the Planning and Community Development Director
may approve a Type 1 Modification of the residential component standard if the Planning and
Community Development Director determines that the project exceeds the mixed-use design elements of this
section.
6. The minimum lot size requirements of the mixed-use district will be waived for mixed-use buildings
where at least 20% of the total floor area is developed for residential uses. However, a minimum lot
depth of 100 feet must be maintained.
B. Nonresidential Component
1. At least 30% of the total gross floor area must be designed and constructed for nonresidential
occupancy. With the exception of wrapped garages (See 30-7-4.2(B)5), parking facilities may not be
counted toward the nonresidential component requirement.
2. Up to 50% of the nonresidential component requirement may be satisfied by existing nonresidential
development located within ¼ mile (convenient, safe walking distance) of the proposed building. Offsite
nonresidential uses are credited using the gross enclosed floor area of the off-site use. To be
included in the calculation, the following conditions must be met:
a. Clearly defined pedestrian connections must be provided between the nonresidential and the
proposed development;
b. The off-site nonresidential use being counted must be a permitted use in the MU zoning district;
and
c. Uses or activities located outside of an enclosed structure and parking facilities may not be
credited toward the requirement.
3. For development projects smaller than 3 acres, the Planning and Community Development Director
may approve a Type 1 Modification of the minimum nonresidential component standard if the Planning
and Community Development Director determines that the project exceeds the mixed-use design
elements of this section.
4. The residential component requirement is waived in vertical mixed use buildings of at least 4 stories in
height if the street frontage of the first floor is entirely occupied by eating and drinking establishments,
personal and professional services or retail sales and service uses. However, penetrations for access to
parking, utilities and the residential component are allowed.
5. In order to encourage the concealment of parking structures (wrapped garages or liner buildings), the
floor area of levels of a parking structure completely obscured from view at ground level of a public
street by enclosed areas designed and constructed for commercial, office, or residential use and
occupancy may be counted towards the nonresidential component requirement. In order to be credited
toward the requirement, the following conditions must be met:
a. Commercial, residential, or office space must have a minimum depth (as measured from the street
wall) of 20 feet and must have windows or doors facing all public streets.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 202
b. The street level floor must be designed and constructed for retail or personal service uses.
However, penetrations for access to the parking structure and utilities are allowed.
c. Upper stories may be designed and constructed for commercial, office, or residential uses.
Figure 7-16, Parking Garage Design
Commentary: In the graphic above the first level 2 levels of parking structure could be counted
towards the commercial component requirement because they are located behind a retail floor space
with a minimum depth of 20 feet.
C. Building Design
Commentary: Building spaces should be designed to allow maximum use flexibility and
accommodate a wide range of occupants and tenants. This means that the building spaces could be
easily modified for different types and sizes of users. For example, the first floor of a building may
be designed to accommodate a restaurant, an office, or retail without requiring substantial structural
modifications to the building.
1. For public entrances to nonresidential or mixed use buildings fronting on a street, a minimum of 75%
of the ground level façade must consist of transparent windows, for a minimum total distance of 30
linear feet surrounding the entrance.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 203
Figure 7-17, Building Design
2. For buildings located on a corner, a minimum of 75% of the ground level façade must consist of
transparent windows, for a minimum total distance of 30 linear feet from the corner.
3. The remaining portion of the building that fronts on a street or parking area must be articulated into
modules not to exceed 30 feet in length.
4. The long sides of the building must be oriented parallel to the street to reinforce or maintain the
existing street patterns.
Figure 7-18, Building Orientation
D. Common Public Area
Common public area must be retained for use and enjoyment of the residents and visitors of the
development in conformance with 30-12-8.2.
E. Parking Lots, Travel Lanes, and Loading Zones
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 204
Commentary: Surface parking is encouraged to be oriented behind or to the side of a building when possible;
parking should be accessed from an alley when feasible.
1. Bicycle parking racks and similar facilities must be provided in conformance with 30-11-8, Bicycle
Parking Facilities.
2. Drive through lanes, when allowed, must be located to the side or rear of a building and must be
designed to minimize conflict with pedestrian circulation.
F. Signs
A common sign plan is required for all developments in an MU- zoning district (see 30-14-11).

F. Standards Applicable to Post Offices
Post offices in the TN district may have only one accessory building. The accessory building must be set
back into the property at least 20 feet from the front façade of the principal structure.
G. General Design Guidelines
1. Compatibility of Design
a. Buildings within a block face must reflect a continuity of building scale at the building line.
b. A consistent building line should be maintained at the setback line along the street. However,
projections of porches, bay windows, stoops, and other minor building masses into the street
setback are encouraged in order to create an interesting block character. Large street setbacks to
accommodate parking lots in front of a building are prohibited.
c. In areas of mixed residential types, the height and massing of a building may not be more than
twice the height and massing of structures adjacent to or across the street from the building.
d. A commercial or mixed-use building must integrate its appearance with the area and may not
exceed twice the height and massing of adjacent buildings
2. Human Scale Design
Human scale design typically reflects the elements listed below.
a. Buildings that avoid long, monotonous, uninterrupted walls or roof planes. Blank, windowless walls
are generally not allowed along street frontages. Where solid walls are required by building codes,
the wall should be articulated by the provision of blank window openings trimmed with frames,
sills, lintels, or if the building is occupied by a commercial use, by using recessed or projecting
display window cases;
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 218
b. Commercial structures that incorporate awnings or arcades, which may project over the sidewalk
into the street right-of-way with city approval;
c. Ground floor retail, service, restaurant, and other commercial uses with transparent display
windows on a minimum of 50% of the first floor front to provide views into the interior of
buildings;
d. Entrances and storefronts facing the street;
e. Doors, windows, balconies, porches, and roof decks with visibility of the street and other public
spaces to encourage social interaction;
f. Porches generally as a significant element of the house design, located on the front or side of the
dwelling; and
g. Rear vehicle access from an alley as a preference. However, if a garage is oriented toward the
street, it must be located a minimum of 20 feet behind the front façade of the principal structure.
Freestanding garages and carport structures for multiple dwelling unit buildings must be designed
to be integral with the building design or sited so as to avoid long and monotonous rows of garage
doors and long monotonous building walls.
3. Guidelines for the Provision of Traditional Neighborhood Open Space
a. Traditional neighborhood open space should be incorporated as a fundamental element of the
Plan.
b. Open spaces should emphasize safe and inviting traditional neighborhood areas such as squares,
parks, and greenways. Such areas should be integrated into the neighborhood pattern for the
active and passive enjoyment of neighborhood residents.
c. Traditional neighborhood open space should be planned and improved to be highly accessible and

Commentary: This section contains the general standards of the various overlay districts. Specific
standards for certain overlay districts are found in separate plans and/or design guidelines.
30-7-8.1 General
A. Overlay zoning is generally used when there is special public interest that does not coincide with the base
zoning districts in a particular geographic area. It is a mapped area that may either impose additional
restrictions or relax certain provisions of the underlying zoning district.
B. Overlay zoning district regulations apply in combination with underlying (base) zoning district regulations
and all other applicable regulations of this ordinance. When overlay district standards conflict with
standards that would otherwise apply under this zoning ordinance, the regulations of the overlay zoning
district govern. Otherwise, all applicable regulations of this zoning ordinance apply in overlay districts.
30-7-8.2 -AO, Airport Overlay District

Triad International (PTI) Airport from inappropriate development.

1. All permit applications, site plans and other plans proposing buildings, signs and other structures with
a height of 50 feet or more must be accompanied by written documentation from the Piedmont Triad
International Airport Authority indicating that the proposal complies with all applicable airport
regulations. No permit or other plan approval may be granted without such written documentation.

Effective on: 9/16/2014
30-8-2 Prohibited Uses
The following uses are prohibited throughout the city:
A. Explosives manufacturing;
B. Leather and leather products manufacturing involving tanning;
C. All agricultural uses not otherwise permitted in the Permitted Use table, except those expressly allowed in
the AG (special district); and
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 247
D. Manufactured dwellings placed, parked, or stored on residentially zoned lots except as provided in:
1. 30-7-8.7 (Manufactured Housing Overlay Districts);
2. 30-8-10.1(F) (Manufactured Dwelling (Mobile Home) Parks;
3. 30-8-12.4 as temporary construction offices, temporary construction equipment storage, or temporary
real estate sales or rental offices; or
4. 30-2-3 (Nonconforming Uses) when the manufactured dwelling is a legally existing principal building.
5. Manufactured dwellings which do not comply with the provisions of this subsection on the effective
date of this ordinance shall be removed within 12 months of the effective date of the ordinance.
E. Uses deemed likely to have adverse impacts on water quality are prohibited within the WCA district. Such
prohibited uses are identified (by a parenthetical note) in the use category descriptions. See also the WCA
provisions of 30-12-4.
30-8-3 Use Categories Generally
30-8-3.1 Approach to Categorizing Uses
A. The use categories found in the use table in 30-8-1, Permitted Use Table, are set forth in this section.
Specific uses may be further defined in Article 15.
B. Any use not specifically listed in the use category in this section is prohibited, unless the Planning and
Community Development Director determines that the use is similar to a permitted use in that district.
Where any similar permitted use is subject to additional use standards or special use permit approval, the
proposed use is also subject to those standards or approval.
30-8-3.2 Basis for Classifications
Use categories classify land uses and activities based on common functional, product, or physical
characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how
goods or services are sold or delivered, likely impact on surrounding properties, and site conditions. The use
categories provide a systematic basis for assigning land uses to appropriate zoning districts.
30-8-3.3 Uses Not Specifically Listed
When a specific use type cannot be readily classified into a use category or appears to fit into 2 or more use
categories, the Planning and Community Development Director is authorized to determine the most similar,
thus most appropriate, use category based on the following considerations:
A. The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each
use category;
B. The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity;
C. Relative amounts of sales from each activity;
D. The customer type for each activity;
E. The relative number of employees in each activity;
F. Hours of operation;
G. Building and site arrangement;
H. Types of vehicles used and their parking requirements;
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 248
I. The relative number of vehicle trips generated;
J. Signs;
K. How the use is advertised;
L. The anticipated impact on surrounding properties; and
M. Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site.
30-8-3.4 Developments with Multiple Principal Uses
Developments with multiple principal uses must conform to the following:
A. When all principal uses of a development fall within one Use Category, the entire development is assigned
to that Use Category;
B. When the principal uses of a development fall within different Use Categories, each principal use must be
classified in the applicable Use Category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that Use
Category; and
C. A development comprised of uses regulated by separate rows on the Use Table must be reviewed using
the most restrictive process from among the proposed uses.
Commentary: For example, if a development includes a convenience store, fuel sales and a
restaurant, and one of those uses is only permitted by special use permit in the district, then the
entire development requires a special use permit.
30-8-3.5 Typical Uses
The "Typical Use Types" portion of each use category lists principal uses common to that use category. The
names of these sample uses are generic and are based on common meanings, not on what a specific use may
call itself. Many accessory uses that are often found with such principal uses are not shown on these lists.
Commentary: For example, a use that calls itself "Wholesale Warehouse," but sells mostly to retail
consumers, is included in the Retail Sales and Service category rather than the Wholesale Trade
category.
30-8-3.6 Excluded Use Types
The "Excluded Uses Types" portion of each use category lists uses that may appear to be part of a particular
category, but that are expressly included in a different use category.

30-8-12 Temporary Use Standards
Commentary: Temporary uses should not be confused with permanent outdoor activities (for
example, a car sales lot) that are only allowed in certain zones and require site plan approval, nor
should they be confused with an outdoor display area (for example, a garden center that is part of a
building supply store) that may be a part of a retail store and require site plan approval.
The uses listed below are considered temporary in nature. Unless otherwise expressly stated, temporary uses
are allowed in any zoning district. Additional restrictions regarding the operation of these uses may be
imposed through the City Code.

30-9-2 Integrated Multiple Use Developments
30-9-2.1 Purpose
The Integrated Multiple Use Development (IMUD) standards of this section are intended to give property
owners the option of organizing a development that contains multiple buildings as a subdivision (with separate
lots, parcels or outparcels) or as a condominium (with separate ownership), with the overall goal of
accommodating multiple building developments with a unified design and function.
30-9-2.2 Applicability
Property owners may elect to use the integrated multiple use development standards of this section for any
development that meets both of the following criteria:
A. contains 2 or more nonresidential establishments organized and managed to function as a unified whole;
and
B. features all of the following:
1. common driveways;
2. common parking,
3. common sign plan, and
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 312
4. common landscape plan.
30-9-2.3 Common Features
A development qualifying as an integrated multiple use development will be treated as a single zone lot for
purposes of providing required off-street parking, required planting yards, required street access, dimensional
requirements, tree conservation, and signs, even if separate parcels are included within the development.
A. Compliance with off-street parking requirements and tree conservation requirements will be evaluated by
considering the development as a whole; compliance will not be evaluated on a parcel-by parcel-basis.
B. If required planting yards are provided along the development perimeter, including street frontages, and
parking lot landscaping requirements are met, planting yards are not required along property lines and
lease lines between parcels within the integrated multiple use development.
30-9-2.4 Plat and Notice Requirements
If the owner of a development elects to organize the development as an integrated multiple use development,
a plat must be recorded displaying a prominent note identifying it as such and explaining that the property
must be developed with common driveways and off-street parking and be subject to a master/common sign
plan, common landscaping plan and a tree conservation plan. The note must further state that should the
property cease to conform to the definition of an integrated multiple use development, the property will then
be in violation of this ordinance and must be retrofitted with conventional parking and landscaping, even if
doing so requires the removal of previously installed improvements.
30-9-3 Street Access
30-9-3.1 Vehicular Access to Public Street Required
Every zone lot must abut and have direct vehicular access to a publicly maintained street, except as provided
in this section. No building or structure may be constructed, erected, or placed on a zone lot that does not
abut and have direct access to a publicly maintained street, except as provided in this section.
30-9-3.2 Dead-End Streets
For purposes of this section, the terminus of a dead-end street does not provide the required access to a
publicly maintained street unless that terminus is a circular turnaround or other turnaround approved and
constructed in conformance with Article 13.
30-9-3.3 Single-Family Detached Cluster and Other Developments
Private streets may be used to meet access requirements for lots in single-family detached cluster
developments and for single-family or twin home lots in planned unit developments, provided the development
as a whole abuts and has direct access to a publicly maintained street.
30-9-3.4 Townhouse Developments
Individual parcels shall have rights of access through common elements containing private streets, private
drives and/or private driveways at least 24 feet in width leading to a publicly maintained street. Individual
parcels may have direct access to a publicly maintained street with Technical Review Committee approval.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 313
30-9-3.5 Integrated Multiple Use Developments
Individual parcels in integrated multiple use developments, whether leased or sold, must have shared rights of
access along private streets, private drives, and/or private driveways at least 24 feet in width leading to a
publicly maintained street.
30-9-3.6 Shared Driveways Required by the Technical Review Committee
The Technical Review Committee is authorized to require shared driveways in lieu of direct driveway access to
each parcel when deemed necessary by the Technical Review Committee for reasons of safety, preservation of
street capacity, or watershed protection. When shared driveways are required, access to parcels without direct
driveway access must be from private driveways covered by private access easements. Driveway maintenance
must be provided by a single dominant owner, an owners association or all owners acting collectively pursuant
to a maintenance agreement.
30-9-3.7 Alleys
Paved alleys maintained by the owners association or by the city may be used to meet access requirements.
30-9-3.8 Exceptions

accessed by easements with a minimum width of 10 feet.
30-9-3.9 Access through Residential Districts Prohibited
Vehicular access to nonresidential zoning districts may not be taken through residential zoning districts unless
approved through the Type 1 Modification procedures of 30-4-11.
30-9-3.10 Cross-access
A. Description and Intent
1. Cross-access is an easement or service drive providing vehicular access between 2 or more contiguous
sites/land-uses so that motorists and/or pedestrians do not need to reenter the public street system to
gain access to an adjacent site/land-use.
2. Cross-access between adjacent properties reduces vehicular conflicts between motorists on the main
street and motorists entering and leaving driveways. Reduced traffic conflicts result in fewer accidents
and improved traffic flow on the main street. The intent of this section is to provide for cross-access
between compatible land-uses that front major/minor thoroughfares so that patrons leaving one
business may access adjoining businesses without having to reenter a busy public street system.
3. It is not the intent of this section to reduce the number of driveways beyond what is already allowed in
other sections of the Driveway Manual.
B. Cross-access is required in the following circumstances:
All new commercial, industrial, and office, developments, or additions to existing developments of over
3,000 square feet of gross floor area; all uses of land without buildings involving more than 40,000 square
feet; and all nonresidential subdivisions, including group developments and integrated multiple use
developments that front thoroughfares and collectors must be designed to provide cross-access to above
mentioned developments.
C. Cross-access Not Required
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 314
Cross-access is not required when the subject adjacent properties have one or more of the following
conditions or barriers:
1. the properties do not have common frontage along the same street;
2. significant topography differences in existing or proposed conditions;
3. significant natural features;
4. vehicular safety factors;
5. existing cross-access provisions;
6. other safety and security factors;
7. incompatible land uses; or
8. existing infrastructure obstructions.
D. Easement Recordation
A cross-access easement must be recorded on the final plat for property involving a subdivision, or
recorded by separate instrument when no plat is proposed.
E. No Obstruction of Access
All cross access must be built to the property line (or lease line). An accessway may not be blocked off,
parked in, or otherwise obstructed unless approved by the Transportation Director .
F. Parking Requirement Relief
Where a required cross-accessway eliminates otherwise required parking spaces, parking space
requirements may be reduced by the number of spaces lost to the provision of the cross-accessway.
G. Perimeter Landscaping Requirement Relief
Where a required cross-accessway eliminates otherwise required perimeter landscape planting area,
perimeter tree and shrub requirements may be reduced by the length of the perimeter affected by the
provision of the cross-accessway.
H. Joint Maintenance
When a cross-access easement is created to serve more than one lot, an owners association or binding
contract is required for the purpose of maintenance.
I. Property Owner Cooperation
Applicants are not required to seek cooperation or permission from the adjacent property owner.
30-9-4 Fences and Walls
30-9-4.1 Applicability
All fences and walls must comply with the standards of this section unless otherwise expressly stated in this

30-10-1.4 Other Landscaping Standards
More specific landscaping standards are established for some zoning districts, such as the CB, CN, TN, MU-M,
MU-H and some overlay districts. See 30-10-3. For the TN district see 30-4-7.5.
30-10-2 Multi-family and Nonresidential Landscaping
Requirements
30-10-2.1 Applicability
A. Multi-family, nonresidential and mixed-use development is subject to standards of this section, which
generally requires street planting yards abutting public rights-of-way (See 30-10-2.2), buffer planting yards
between different land use classifications (See 30-10-2.3) and parking lot landscaping (See 30-10-2.6).
B. The standards of this section do not apply to multi-family, nonresidential or mixed-use development in MUM,
MU-H, TN, CN or CB districts. Development in those districts is subject to the urban landscaping
requirements of 30-10-3.
C. For the CB zoning district, see the Downtown Greensboro Design Manual for applicable guidelines.
30-10-2.2 Street Planting Yards
A. Street planting yards must be installed abutting public street rights-of-way.
B. The required street planting yard must have a minimum width of 10 feet (as measured from the outside
edge of the right-of-way or the back of the sidewalk, whichever is further from the street centerline) and
include at least 2 canopy trees and 17 shrubs per 100 linear feet of required street planting yard, not
including allowed driveways.
C. Some changes to these standards are permitted as found in 30-10-2.5 and 30-10-5.

City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 330
30-10-2.3 Buffer Planting Yards
Buffer planting yards are required along the perimeter of a lot or development site (except portions parallel to
a public street). They are intended to mitigate potential adverse impacts that may result when higher intensity
land uses are located adjacent to lower intensity land uses.
A. Type of Buffer Planting Yard Required
1. To determine the type of buffer planting yard required, first identify the class of the proposed (new,
changed, or expanded) use and then identify the class of each existing use on adjacent sites (See
Table 10-2). Then using Table 10-1, the intersection of the row associated with the proposed use and
the column associated with the adjacent use shows the type of planting yard required. Staff will
determine the location of planting to provide for the maximum visual buffer effect.
Commentary: For sites abutting vacant property see also buffer
requirements in Section 30-10-2.6(B).

30-10-2.4 Planting Yards on Slopes
A. Slopes of 17% to 33%
For slopes between 17% and 33%, the Planning and Community Development Director is authorized to
determine the location of planting to provide the maximum visual buffer effect.
B. Steep Slope Planting Yards (Slopes of More than 33%)
1. Tree-Covered Slopes
If a planting yard has a slope of more than 33% but less than 50% and the required tree coverage for
a planting yard exists on the slope, then the slope area will be deemed to satisfy planting yard
requirements if no healthy trees or vegetation are removed and no grading or other clearing occurs.
2. Slopes with Minimal or No Tree Cover
If a planting yard has a slope of more than 33% but less than 50% but lacks the required tree
coverage for a planting yard, then additional trees and vegetation must be provided to satisfy
minimum planting yard requirements. No healthy trees or vegetation may be removed and no grading
or other clearing may occur.
C. Reforestation of Slopes of Greater than 33%
Areas having slopes of more than 33% must be reforested to provide tree cover over the entire area. All
plans for reforestation must include a minimum of one tree per 400 square feet of surface area and may
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 334
be made up of a mixture of deciduous hardwood and evergreen trees. The trees must be a minimum 2-
inch caliper (water-wise species) or 3-inch caliper (non-water-wise species) at the time of planting. All
plans for reforestation are subject to approval by the Planning and Community Development Director.
30-10-2.5 Street Planting Yard and Buffer Planting Yard Flexibility
The following standards apply to street planting yards and buffer planting yards.
A. Canopy trees may be substituted for shrubs at the rate of one canopy tree for 8 shrubs and understory
trees may be substituted for shrubs at the rate of one understory tree for 5 shrubs if approved by the
Planning and Community Development Director.
B. Understory trees shall be substituted for canopy trees at the rate of 2 understory trees for every canopy
tree when planted within 20 feet of an overhead utility line as measured from the utility pole. (See
Landscaping and Tree Conservation Manual)
C. On lots of record that existed prior to July 1, 1992 that are less than 55,000 square feet in area, no
development is required to landscape more than 15% of the site.
D. Canopy trees from required planting yards may be relocated to the street right-of-way if all of the
following conditions are met and if approved by the Planning and Community Development Director:
1. The proposed landscape plan complies with all provisions of 30-10-2;
2. The entire street cross-section is being constructed as part of the development or the street is existing
with the abutting lots devoid of street trees;
3. Sidewalks are existing or are being installed as part of the development;
4. There are no overhead utilities parallel to the right-of-way line; and the Engineering and Inspections
Director certifies that planting would not conflict with utility maintenance and public service functions;
5. The right-of-way width and street width complies with applicable city standards; and
6. GDOT (or NCDOT) has determined that there is no proposed street widening or turn-lane construction
along the lot frontage or other transportation infrastructure or operations issues that would conflict
with the plantings.
30-10-2.6 Parking Lot Landscaping
Requiring landscaping within parking areas is intended to shade and improve the attractiveness of large areas
of pavement.
A. Required Landscaping
1. Parking lot planting yards must include at least one canopy tree for every 12 parking spaces.
2. Required canopy tree areas must be located within the parking lot. They may be located in landscape
islands, landscape divider medians between rows of parking, or in driveway medians.
3. Islands or other planting areas for canopy trees must have a minimum area of 200 square feet with a
minimum dimension of 7 feet, measured in any direction. Islands or planting areas of less than 200
square feet may not be counted toward satisfying parking lot landscaping requirements.
4. The landowner may provide required landscape islands or planting areas using one or more of the
planting area sizes below. Each parking space must be entirely within the designated distance of a
parking lot planting area as specified below:
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 335
Table 104: Location of Parking Lot Planting Areas

Max. Distance from
Parking Space (feet)
200-499 1 100 (1)
500+ 3 130
(1) Canopy trees installed as part of a required planting yard that abuts the parking lot may be used for up to 50% of the required
distance
5. Grouping canopy trees within the same landscape island or planting area is strongly encouraged, even
if this would decrease the number of islands within the parking lot.
B. When a parking lot or other vehicular use area abuts a vacant site or a site with the same land use
classification as the subject site, a planting yard with a minimum width of 5 feet must be provided
between the parking lot/vehicular use area and the abutting (interior) property line. This required planting
area must be landscaped with at least 2 understory trees and 18 evergreen shrubs per 100 linear feet.
C. Trees used to satisfy the planting requirements for parking lot areas may not be counted toward the
planting requirements for other required plantings on the site.
Figure 10-4, Parking Lot Planting
30-10-2.7 Tree Conservation and Parking Lot Plantings
For new, expanded, or rebuilt parking lots where trees are being preserved adjacent to the parking lot in order
to meet the parking lot planting requirements, trees preserved in a Tree Conservation Area (TCA) and within 8
feet of the parking lot may be used to satisfy up to 50% of the required number of parking lot trees. Tree
conservation areas that are notched into corners or edges of a parking lot are deemed to be within the
parking lot, not adjacent to it. Trees in the adjacent TCA counted toward planting yard requirements may not
also be counted for required parking lot trees. Extra trees in such locations may be counted. It is the
landowners option to save trees within the parking lot. In order to do so, the critical root zone must be
preserved. Credits for preserving parking lot trees are determined by the critical root zone preserved for the
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 336
tree being saved (See Article 12). One tree for every 400 square feet of critical root zone preserved may be
used to satisfy up to 50% of the required number of parking lot trees.
30-10-3 Urban Landscaping Requirements
30-10-3.1 Applicability
Multi-family, nonresidential and mixed-use development in RM-40, MU-M, MU-H, TN, C-N districts and any
parcel adjacent and accessible to an existing or planned greenway as described in Table 7-14 of 30-7-5.1 are
subject to the urban landscaping requirements of this section.

Pedestrian landscaping is required along all street frontages. Pedestrian landscaping requirements can be met
by one or a combination of the following 4 options:
A. providing a street planting yard measured from the edge of the right-of-way or back of sidewalk
(whichever is farther from the centerline) that includes 2 canopy trees per 100 linear feet or 6 understory
trees per 100 linear feet when located within 15 feet of overhead utilities;
B. providing a minimum 10-foot wide sidewalk with canopy trees planted in tree wells (with grates) at 30-foot
intervals;
C. providing a minimum 10-foot wide sidewalk that is at least 50% covered with weather-protection materials
(such as canopies and awnings); or
D. providing a plaza between the building and the right-of-way a minimum of 10 feet in width along 50% of
the building wall that consists of pavers or hardscape material different from the sidewalk and permanently
fixed planters with vegetation.
30-10-3.3 Vehicular Use Area Screening
A. The perimeter of all vehicular use areas must be screened from any abutting residentially zoned property.
Such screening must consist of one of the following 2 options:
1. A 4-foot-high masonry wall; or
2. A planting yard with a minimum width of 5 feet, a 100% sight-obscuring fence with a height of at least
6 feet and at least one evergreen understory tree per 30 linear feet of planting yard (planted on the
outside of the fence).
B. The perimeter of all vehicular use areas containing 10 or more parking spaces or 400 square feet or more
paved area must be screened from all abutting rights-of-way. Such screening must consist of one of the
following 2 options:
1. A minimum 5-foot wide planting yard and enough evergreen shrubs to form a continuous visual screen
at least 2.5 feet in height and a maximum of 3.5 feet in height; or

to any above-grade structure.
F. Stormwater facility with an approved alternative compliance plan.
G. Freestanding signs that comply with 30-14-7.3(B)4).
30-10-4.8 Setback Less than Planting Yard Width
If the required building setback is less than the required planting yard width, the minimum required building
setback governs, reducing the required planting yard width only alongside the building. The planting rate of
the required planting yard still applies, although location may be modified in accordance with 30-10-5.
30-10-4.9 Plantings in Shaded Areas
Where a building is located less than 10 feet from a property line, and the planting yard would be heavily
shaded by buildings on both sides of the property line, the required trees and shrubs may be planted outside
the shaded area to improve survivability.
30-10-4.10 Obstructions
Landscaping may not obstruct the view of motorists using any street, driveway, or parking aisle, subject to the
standards of Chapter 16 of the City Code, Obstructions to Cross-Visibility.
30-10-4.11 Planting in Easements
A. A minimum width of 5 feet, or at least half the minimum required planting yard width, whichever is

Tree Conservation Manual).
E. Trees and shrubs may be planted in underground utility easements provided the root structure of the
proposed tree is not anticipated to extend more than 3 feet below the ground. Shrubs may be planted,
provided they are only within the outer 3 feet of the easement.
30-10-4.12 Maintenance of Planting Yards
A. Plant Protection
Whenever planting yards are adjacent to parking lots or drives, they must be protected from damage by
vehicles, lubricants, or fuels.
B. Responsibility
The landowner is responsible for maintaining all required plant materials and planting areas in good health
and appearance. Any dead, unhealthy, or missing plants (whether preserved or installed) must be replaced
with new plant material equal in quantity and quality to the plant material required to be preserved or
installed. Replacement plant material must be replanted within 180 days of the date of owner notification.
The obligation for continuous maintenance is binding on any subsequent owners of the property or any
other parties having a controlling interest in the property.
C. Irrigation
Drip irrigation including drip misters are recommended for use in required planting yards during the
establishment period. After establishment, supplemental watering may be reduced and used on an asneeded
basis. Traditional spray irrigation is prohibited except in turf areas.
D. Pruning
All required trees must be allowed to reach their mature size and must be maintained at their mature size.
Trimming and pruning must be conducted in strict compliance with the American National Standards
Institute. Topping is not an acceptable pruning practice. Topping is the reduction of a trees size using
heading cuts that shorten limbs or branches back to a predetermined crown limit. The Planning and
Community Development Director may require the removal and replacement of any trees that have been
topped or excessively trimmed to where the health of the trees are significantly impacted.
30-10-4.13 Credit for Preservation of Existing Trees
Any existing tree or group of trees that stands within or near a required planting area and meets or exceeds
the standards of this section (30-10-4) may be used to satisfy applicable tree planting requirements, subject to
the requirements of this subsection.
A. To receive credit, trees being preserved must have a minimum DBH of 4 inches and must be protected
from direct and indirect root damage and trunk and crown disturbance.
B. Any trees for which credit has been received that die must be replaced in accordance with minimum tree
planting requirements.
C. Trees located in a designated TCA will be credited towards the planting area requirements at the rate
shown in the following table:
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 341

D. Regardless of the number or size of preserved trees in required street planting yards, there must be at
least one canopy tree for every 50 linear feet of street planting yard.
30-10-5 Alternate Methods of Compliance
Alternate methods of compliance with the landscaping regulations of this chapter may be approved in
accordance with the Type 1 Modification procedures of 30-4-11.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 342
Article 11. Off-Street Parking and Loading
30-11-1 Scope and Purpose
The regulations of this article are intended to ensure provision of off-street parking and loading facilities in
rough proportion to the typical parking and loading demands of different land uses. By requiring such facilities,
it is the intent of this article to help avoid the negative impacts associated with excessive spillover parking
(into adjacent neighborhoods), while at the same time avoiding the negative environmental and urban design
impacts that can result from an over-supply of parking spaces and other vehicular use areas.
30-11-2 Applicability
30-11-2.1 New Development
Unless otherwise expressly stated, the parking and loading standards of this article apply to all new buildings
constructed and all new uses established in all zoning districts.
30-11-2.2 Enlargements and Expansions
A. Unless otherwise expressly stated, the parking and loading standards of this article apply whenever an
existing building or use is enlarged or expanded to include additional dwelling units, floor area, seating
capacity, or other units of measurement used for establishing off-street parking and loading requirements.
B. In the case of enlargements or expansions triggering requirements for additional parking or loading,
additional off-street parking and loading spaces are required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area,
not the entire building or use. In other words, there is no requirement to address lawfully existing parking
or loading deficits.
30-11-2.3 Change of Use or Occupancy
Unless otherwise expressly stated, when the nonresidential use or nonresidential occupancy of property
changes, additional off-street parking and loading facilities must be provided to serve the new use or
occupancy only when the number of parking or loading spaces required for the new use or occupancy exceeds
the number of spaces required for the use that most recently occupied the building, based on the standards of
this development ordinance. In other words, credit is given to the most recent lawful use of the property for
the number of parking spaces that would be required under this development ordinance, regardless of
whether such spaces are actually provided. A new nonresidential use is not required to address a lawful,
existing parking deficit. The provisions of this section do not apply to residential uses or occupancies. If a
residential use is established in a building formerly used for nonresidential purposes, required parking spaces
must be provided for the residential use.
30-11-3 Compliance Required
Existing parking and loading spaces may not be reduced below the minimum ratios established in this article or
increased above any maximum parking ratios established in this article.
30-11-4 Exemptions and Reductions

the citys inventory as determined by the Greensboro Historic Preservation Commission.
30-11-4.3 Reduction for TN District
The minimum parking ratios of 30-11-5 are reduced by 25% for uses in the TN district.
30-11-4.4 Exemption/Reduction for Small Lots
Nonresidential uses on lawfully established lots with less than 60 feet of frontage are not required to provide
parking unless such use exceeds 3,000 square feet of gross floor area, in which case parking must be provided
for the floor area in excess of 3,000 square feet. In the case of a corner lot, this exemption applies if any
street frontage is less than 60 feet.
30-11-4.5 Exemption for Existing Buildings on Constrained Sites
The Planning and Community Development Director is authorized to approve a Type 1 Modification for a
reduction in the minimum parking ratios of 30-11-5 for buildings in existence before July 1, 2010 when it is
determined that the parking reduction will facilitate compliance with landscaping, open space, or
dumpster/recyclable storage area requirements. The amount of such reduction may not exceed 33% or 25
spaces whichever is less.
30-11-4.6 Reductions for MU-M, MU-H and CN Districts
The minimum parking ratios of 30-11-5 are reduced by 25% for all development in MU-M, MU-H and CN
districts. Further parking reductions in these districts may be approved in accordance with 30-11-13.
30-11-4.7 Exemption/Reduction in Historic Districts
Parking in any historic overlay district shall comply with the requirements of 30-4-12.4(I).
30-11-4.8 Reduction/Maximum in Other Overlays
Parking in other overlay districts with parking standards shall comply with the requirements of the appropriate
design manual.
30-11-4.9 Alternate Ratios for AO, NS, and UMU Districts
A. Mixed Use Development Credit
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 344
Mixed-use developments shall receive a parking credit of 10% of the total spaces required. No parking
study shall be required unless this credit is combined with another credit request.
B. Adaptive Re-Use of Historic Structure Credit
Developments that incorporate the adaptive re-use of a historic structure shall receive a credit of 10% of
the total spaces required. No parking study shall be required unless this credit is combined with another
credit request.
C. Demonstrated Parking
Developments that incorporate demonstrated parking shall receive a credit up to 30% of the total spaces
required and in accordance with the following:
1. Upon receipt of an application for demonstrated parking, the Planning Director is authorized to apply
the parking credit on the basis of parking demand data provided.
2. Parking data and studies must include estimates of parking demand based on reliable data collected
from comparable uses or on external data from credible research organizations. Comparability will be
determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity and location. Parking studies must document
the source of all data used to develop recommended requirements.
3. The applicant must establish a reserve area which is clearly designated on all plans and of a size and
shape sufficient to provide the number of parking spaces equal to the credit granted.
4. Upon a determination by the Planning Director that additional parking is needed, it must be installed
within 30 days or be subject to the enforcement procedures of Article 5.
Commentary: Demonstrated parking refers to a situation in which a proposed use is required to
demonstrate that it has the capacity to meet the minimum parking requirement, but does not
necessarily need to actually construct all of the required amount if it only needs a portion of its
demonstrated capacity (the un-built capacity would be land banked on the site as a reserve for
future parking if needed.) Then if a situation arises where the original use is replaced by a new use,
the site will have the capacity to provide additional parking, if necessary, which would be built on
the land banked reserve area.
D. The minimum parking ratios of 30-11-5 are altered, as indicated on the table below, for the residential
portions of mixed use developments in AO, NS, and UMU districts.
Minimum Parking Spaces for Residential Portions of Mixed Use Development

30-11-6 Calculations
30-11-6.1 Area-Based Standards
Unless otherwise expressly stated, all area-based (square footage) parking standards must be computed on
the basis of gross floor area.
30-11-6.2 Employee- or Occupancy-based Standards
A. When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, the result is rounded
down to the next lower whole number.
B. For the purpose of calculating parking requirements based on employees, students, or other occupants,
calculations must be based on the total persons and employees present or on duty at the time when
maximum use of the building or land is being made.
C. The number of persons in assembly areas with fixed seating or a designed seating capacity must be based
on maximum seating capacity.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 348
D. The number of persons in assembly areas without fixed seating or without a designed seating capacity
must be based on the total net floor area (square feet) actually used for public assembly, divided by 5.
E. If more than one assembly area within a building is regularly used simultaneously by different adult
persons, then the capacity of all such assembly areas must be computed.
F. If several assembly areas within a building are not used simultaneously but are used by the same group of
persons separately at different times, then the computation need include only the assembly area
comprising the maximum simultaneous occupancy.
30-11-6.3 Establishment of Other Parking Ratios
A. Upon receipt of an application for a use for which no parking ratio is established in 30-11-5, the Planning
and Community Development Director is authorized to apply the parking ratio that applies to the most
similar use or establish a different minimum parking requirement on the basis of parking demand data
provided.
B. Parking data and studies must include estimates of parking demand based on reliable data collected from
comparable uses or on external data from credible research organizations. Comparability will be
determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity and location. Parking studies must document the
source of all data used to develop recommended requirements.
30-11-7 Vehicle Stacking for Uses with Drive-through Facilities
Uses with drive-through facilities must provide vehicle stacking space in accordance with 30-8-10.4(I).
30-11-8 Short-Term Bicycle Parking
30-11-8.1 Spaces Required
A. Short-term bicycle parking is required in commercial parking garages and in MU-M, MU-H, CN, RM-26 and
RM-40 districts at the minimum rate of 1 bicycle space per 10 parking spaces provided. In all cases, at
least 2 short-term bicycle parking spaces must be provided. No use is required to provide more than 25
short-term bicycle parking spaces.
B. The Planning and Community Development Director is authorized to approve a Type 1 Modification waiving
or reducing the number of short-term bicycle parking spaces required for a particular use in accordance
with 30-4-11.
30-11-8.2 Design and Location
A. Required short-term bicycle parking spaces must be provided in bicycle parking racks, and each bike space
must have minimum dimensions of 2 feet in width by 6 feet in length and a minimum overhead vertical
clearance of 7 feet. Racks must be affixed securely to the ground or a building.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 349
Figure 11-1, Short-Term Bicycle Parking Space Design and Location
B. Bicycle racks must be safe, sturdy, secure and manufactured for use as bicycle racks.
C. Required short-term bicycle parking spaces may be located indoors or outdoors, provided they are located
within 100 feet of a public building entrance or in an alternative location approved by the Planning and
Community Development Director through the Type 1 Modification process. Short-term bicycle parking
spaces must be located on private property unless the Planning and Community Development Director
approves location within the public right-of-way (i.e., on the sidewalk) through the Type 1 Modification
process. If required bicycle parking facilities are not visible from the public building entrance, signs must
be posted indicating their location.
D. When more than 10 bicycle parking spaces are required, the Planning and Community Development
Director may, through the Type 1 Modification process, allow a reduction of up to 2 required vehicle
parking spaces to accommodate bicycle parking.
30-11-9 Use of Required Parking Areas
30-11-9.1 Required off-street parking areas are intended to be used solely for the parking of licensed
motor vehicles in operating condition and for permitted temporary events. Required spaces may not be
used for the display of goods for sale or lease or for storage of vehicles, boats, or recreational vehicles
or building materials.
30-11-9.2 Required off-street parking spaces are intended to serve residents, tenants, patrons,
employees, or guests of the principal use. Off-street parking spaces that are required by this ordinance
must be maintained for the life of the principal use.
30-11-9.3 No motor vehicle repair work of any kind is permitted in a required parking space.
30-11-9.4 Off-street parking in residential districts is intended to be used solely for the parking of
passenger motor vehicles. No trucks may be parked in residential districts, except for vehicles actively
being used for deliveries and trucks that are less than 30 feet in length.
30-11-10 Location of Parking Areas
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 350
30-11-10.1 General
A. Except as otherwise expressly stated in this ordinance, required parking spaces must be located on the
same lot as the use to be served by the parking area
B. Required parking areas must be clearly delineated.
30-11-11 Parking for Single-family and Duplex Dwellings
30-11-11.1 All parking for single-family and two-family dwellings shall be provided so as to maintain a
primarily residential appearance in front yards and to protect the quality and character of residential
neighborhoods. Accordingly, areas used for parking and drives must be designed, located, and
constructed to meet the standards of this section.
30-11-11.2
A. Parking spaces and drives in front yards (i.e., the portion of the lot located between the side lot
lines from the front building line of the principal building to the front lot line) must be clearly
defined from the front yard area, constructed and adequately maintained with a hard all-weather
surface such as asphalt, concrete, brick, CABC (gravel), pervious paving or other approved
material. Grass and bare earth areas are expressly prohibited. These requirements also apply to
areas used for parking and drives within the street side yard (between the principal structure and
the side street right-of-way) that are unscreened and visible from a public street. The edge of all
parking and drive areas within front and street side yards must be clearly defined from the front
and street side yard area. All parking and drive areas must be contiguous.
B. No vehicle over 26 feet in length or 14,000 pounds in weight, except for a recreational vehicle,
may be parked in front yards or street side yards, unless inside an enclosed structure on the
street side yard.
(Amended by Ord. 16-10 on 1/19/16)
30-11-11.3 No more than 40% of the front yard area of a lot occupied by a detached single-family
dwelling or duplex may be a defined parking area unless the Technical Review Committee grants a Type
2 Modification. Some examples of cases eligible for consideration of a Type 2 Modification are as follows:
A. the area is primarily used for vehicular drive and turnaround movements and not for the parking
of vehicles;
B. the area required to meeting minimum off-street parking requirements and reasonable access
drives would exceed 40% of the front yard area;
C. the lot is less than 50 feet wide, and the Technical Review Committee determines it is infeasible
to limit paving to less than 40% of the front yard;
D. the topography, location of the dwelling or the existing development of adjoining areas prevents
conformance;
E. a portion of the area is necessary to provide accessibility for disabled persons; and
F. the existing all-weather surface currently exceeds 40% of the front yard and a portion of the allweather
surface is either designated as driveway only (or for a non-parking use) and/or physically
restricted or barricaded from use as vehicle parking.
30-11-11.4 Notwithstanding the nonconformity regulations of Article 2, the requirements of this
section (30-11-11) apply to all existing and future required or proposed parking areas and drives.
(Amended by Ord 11-42 on 3/1/11 and Ord. 13-124 on 9/17/13)
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 351
30-11-11.5 Parking a vehicle on the front yard of any property containing a single-family or two-family
dwelling, except on a hard all-weather surface as specified in section 30-11-11.2, is a violation of this
section. Vehicles which are parked in front yards in violation of this section shall be subject to
enforcement under section 30-5-6.
(Amended by Ord. 16-10 on 1/19/16)
30-11-12 Parking Area Design
30-11-12.1 General Requirements
Parking facilities must be designed and constructed to:
A. Allow unobstructed movement into and out of each parking space without interfering with fixed objects or
vehicles.
B. Minimize delay and interference with traffic on streets and drives.
C. Maximize sight distances from parking lot exits and access drives.
D. Require all off-street parking spaces in parking lots to have access from parking lot driveways, private
drives, private driveways or private streets and not directly from streets.
E. When located in any residential zoning district, except RM-26 and RM-40, no parking area with 5 or more
spaces may be located within 5 feet of a principal building.
F. All common driveways must have approved traffic circulation and must be kept available for emergency
and service use by any public vehicle.
30-11-12.2 Access
All parking areas must have vehicular access to a street, either directly or via a shared driveway or an alley.
30-11-12.3 Design Standards
Parking lots must be designed and constructed in accordance with the Driveway Manual. Vehicle stacking
areas associated with drive-through facilities must comply with 30-8-10.4(I).
30-11-12.4 Surface Material
A. Required parking spaces, access drives, and loading areas must be paved and maintained with concrete,
asphalt, or similar material of sufficient thickness and consistency to support anticipated traffic volumes
and weights. Alternative paving materials or parking surfaces (including pervious surfaces) may be
approved by the Engineering and Inspections Director if such materials or surfaces are demonstrated to
exhibit equivalent wear resistance and load bearing characteristics as concrete or asphalt. In floodplain
areas, watershed critical areas or within protected ground areas where tree conservation and no grading
are to occur, alternative surfaces that allow greater water infiltration may be approved by the Technical
Review Committee in consultation with the Engineering and Inspections Director. Such alternative surfaces
must be adequately maintained to provide a stable parking surface.
B. Access drives must be paved and maintained from the curb line to a point at least 10 feet beyond the
public right-of-way line for all parking and loading facilities, whether paved or unpaved.
C. Required parking may be constructed with gravel or other comparable all-weather surface, consistent with
30-11-12.7, for:
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 352
1. parking facilities used on an irregular basis by religious assembly uses, private clubs, or other similar
nonprofit organizations.
2. parking facilities for residential uses or a Tourist Home (Bed and Breakfast) where 6 or fewer spaces
are required and located within an R-district.
3. parking facilities for agricultural uses.
4. parking facilities in the HI district, or for manufacturing and industrial uses in the LI district.
5. parking facilities for tracked heavy construction equipment, skid-mounted equipment, and similar
equipment.
6. parking facilities for residential-office conversions where 5 or fewer spaces are required (30-8-10.4(L))
D. Non-required parking for any use may be constructed with gravel or other comparable all-weather surface,
consistent with 30-11-12.7.
30-11-12.5 Drainage
Where parking facilities are paved, curb and gutter or an equivalent drainage system must be provided along
the periphery of the parking lot, except where it is determined by the Water Resources Department that such
system is not practical for storm drainage purposes. This provision is not intended to prevent the use of lowimpact
design (LID) techniques such as breached curb drainage inlets or curb cuts to allow runoff flow into
bioretention cells or biofiltration swales.
30-11-12.6 Grading and Drainage
All parking areas must be graded, properly drained, stabilized, and maintained to minimize dust and erosion.
30-11-12.7 Markings
All parking spaces and stacking lanes must be clearly identified with paint lines, bumper guards, curbs, or
similar treatment.
30-11-12.8 Wheel Guards
All parking spaces must be provided with wheel guards or curbs located so that no part of a parked vehicle will
extend beyond the property line or encroach more than 2 feet into a required planting area. If no wheel
guards are provided, vehicle encroachment is considered as 2 feet beyond the curb.
30-11-12.9 Solid Waste Collection Facilities
See 30-9-7.
30-11-12.10 Walkways
Interior pedestrian circulation routes between principal buildings and public streets must be provided through
clearly defined walkways via direct walking routes. Such walkways must have a minimum unobstructed width
of 4 feet.
30-11-12.11 Landscaping
Parking areas must be designed to comply with the landscaping requirements of Article 10.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 353
30-11-12.12 Maintenance
All parking areas and vehicular use areas must be permanently maintained by the owners or occupants as long
as the use served by the parking exists.
30-11-12.13 Large Parking Areas
Retail development sites that include more than 500 outdoor, surface parking spaces must:
A. provide safe, visible access for pedestrian traffic to and through the development site through the use of
such techniques as changes in paving surface materials, specially paved or painted crosswalks, pedestrian
walkways, pedestrian refuge islands and safety and directional lighting; and
B. use traffic calming techniques for pedestrian safety.

30-11-13 Alternative Compliance Parking Plans
30-11-13.1 Scope
This section authorizes several options for meeting the parking standards of this article.
30-11-13.2 Review and Approval Procedure
Applicants seeking approval of an alternative compliance parking plan must secure approval in accordance
with the Type 1 Modification procedures of 30-4-11.
30-11-13.3 Contents
Alternative compliance parking plans must be submitted in a form established by the Planning and Community
Development Director. At a minimum, such plans must detail the type of alternative proposed and the
rationale for such a proposal, including any supporting research or documentation required by the director.
30-11-13.4 Recording
An attested copy of an approved alternative compliance parking plan must be filed with the Register of Deeds
for recordation in a form approved by the City Attorney. No building permit, parking lot permit, or certificate of
occupancy may be issued without proof of recordation of the agreement.
30-11-13.5 Violations
Violations of an approved alternative compliance parking plan will be considered violations of this ordinance
and be subject to the ordinances penalty and enforcement provisions.
30-11-13.6 Approval Criteria
In order to gain approval of an alternative compliance parking plan, the applicant must demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the authorized decision-making body that the proposed plan:
A. will comply with all applicable requirements of this section;
B. will not adversely affect surrounding neighborhoods;
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 354
C. will not adversely affect traffic congestion and circulation; and
D. will not have a negative effect on the economic viability or appearance of the project or on the
environment.
30-11-13.7 Authorized Alternatives
The following alternative compliance parking plans (or combinations thereof) may be considered for approval:
A. Shared parking (See 30-11-13.8);
B. Off-site parking (See 30-11-13.9);
C. Special facilities for cyclists (See 30-11-13.10);
D. Transit accessibility (See 30-11-13.11);
E. Available on-street parking spaces (See 30-11-13.12); and
F. Reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces required by up to 10% to allow an existing
development to retrofit parking to conform to the landscaping regulations or to allow an existing or new
development to preserve trees within or adjacent to a parking lot.
30-11-13.8 Shared Parking
A. Authorization and Criteria
The Planning and Community Development Director may permit up to 100% of the parking required for
one use to be supplied by the off-street parking spaces provided for another use if the Planning and
Community Development Director determines that the various activities will have different peak parking
demand periods. In order to approve an alternative compliance parking plan for shared parking, the
Planning and Community Development Director must find, based on competent evidence provided by the
applicant, that that there is no substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of the uses for which the
sharing of parking is proposed.
A request for approval of a shared parking arrangement must be accompanied by such information
determined by the Planning and Community Development Director as necessary to evaluate the peak
parking demand characteristics or differences in hours and/or days of operation, including, but not limited
to, a description of the uses and their operational characteristics, a site plan, and a parking study prepared
by a licensed professional traffic engineer or equivalent qualified professional which justifies the reduction
in parking requested.
B. Location of Shared Parking Facility
A use for which an application is being made for shared parking must be located within 1,000 feet walking
distance of the shared parking, measured from the entrance of the use to the nearest parking space within
the shared parking lot.
C. Shared Parking Agreement
An agreement providing for the shared use of parking areas, executed by the parties involved, must be
filed with the Planning and Community Development Director, in a form approved by the City Attorney.
Shared parking privileges will continue in effect only as long as the agreement, binding on all parties,
remains in force. Agreements must guarantee long-term availability of the parking, commensurate with the
use served by the parking.
30-11-13.9 Off-Site Parking
The Planning and Community Development Director may permit all or a portion of required off-street parking
spaces to be located on a remote and separate lot from the lot on which the principal use is located, subject to
the standards of this section.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 355
A. Location of Off-Site Parking
Off-site parking spaces must be located within 1,000 feet of the primary entrance of the use served by the
parking, measured along the shortest legal walking route. This distance limitation may be waived by the
Planning and Community Development Director if adequate assurances are offered that regularly
scheduled van or shuttle service will be operated between the shared lot and the principal use. In addition
to this distance limitation, off-site parking may not be located across an intervening major thoroughfare,
except that off-site parking serving colleges, community-scale places of public assembly, universities,
hospitals, convention centers, stadiums and other major public institutional facilities may be located across
an intervening major thoroughfare subject to the provision of pedestrian safety measures required by the
Transportation Department and the Planning and Community Development Department.
B. Uses
Off-site parking is not allowed for bars, nightclubs, brewpubs, day care and other uses that in the
determination of the Planning and Community Development Director are not appropriate for off-site
parking because of their potential for adverse, late-night impacts on surrounding land uses or their
potential to create unsafe pedestrian or vehicular traffic conditions.
C. Zoning Classification
1. Required parking spaces for uses in nonresidential zoning districts may be located in any other
nonresidential zoning district but may not be located in any residential zoning district. Off-site parking
serving uses in nonresidential zoning districts may be located on a residentially zoned lot only if (a) the
lot immediately abuts the nonresidential zoning district and (b) the lot is occupied by a public assembly
use.
2. Off-site parking areas serving uses in residential districts require the same or more intensive zoning
than the use served by the parking.
D. Off-Site Parking Agreement
An agreement providing for the use of off-site parking, executed by the parties involved, must be filed with
the Planning and Community Development Director, in a form approved by the City Attorney. Off-site
parking privileges will continue in effect only as long as the agreement, binding on all parties, remains in
force. Agreements must guarantee long-term availability of the parking, commensurate with the use
served by the parking. If an off-site parking agreement lapses or is no longer valid, then parking must be
provided as otherwise required by this article.
30-11-13.10 Special Facilities for Bicyclists
The Planning and Community Development Director may authorize up to a 10% reduction in the number of
required off-street parking spaces for developments or uses that provide additional facilities to accommodate
bicyclists. Examples of such accommodations include enclosed bicycle lockers, secure indoor bicycle parking
spaces, employee shower facilities and dressing areas for employees. A reduction in parking may not be
granted merely for providing required short-term bicycle parking spaces.
30-11-13.11 Transit Accessibility
The Planning and Community Development Director may authorize up to a 15% reduction in required parking
for uses located within 1,000 feet of an active transit stop.
30-11-13.12 On-street Spaces
The Planning and Community Development Director may authorize on-street parking spaces to be counted
toward the minimum number of parking spaces established in this article. Only spaces located between the
subject lots property lines, as projected on both sides of the street, may be counted.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 356
(Amended by Ord. 10-156 on 10/19/10)
30-11-14 Off-Street Loading Facilities
Vehicle loading and unloading areas must be provided in sufficient number to provide for safe and efficient
operation and vehicle circulation as reviewed and approved by the Transportation Director.
30-11-14.1 Plans Required
A plan must be submitted with every site and development plan, building permit, or certificate of occupancy
for any use or structure required or proposing to provide off-street loading facilities. The plan must accurately
designate the required or proposed off-street loading spaces, dimensions and clearance, and access to the
loading spaces. The plan must be reviewed and approved by the Transportation Director.
30-11-14.2 Design
A. Space Size
Off-street loading spaces, excluding maneuvering areas, must be at least 10 feet wide and 25 feet long
unless off-street loading will involve the use of semi-tractor trailer combinations or other vehicles in excess
of 25 feet in length, in which case loading spaces must be at least 12 feet wide and 60 feet long. A
minimum vertical clearance of 14 feet must be maintained. The Technical Review Committee is authorized
to approve a Type 2 Modification of these loading space dimensional standards when site conditions or
expected loading activities warrant.
B. Surfacing and Maintenance
Loading areas and access drives must be paved and maintained with concrete, asphalt, or similar material
of sufficient thickness and consistency to support anticipated traffic volumes and weights unless otherwise
approved by the Engineering and Inspections Director.

Article 12. Natural Resources
30-12-1 Tree Conservation
30-12-1.1 Purpose
The tree conservation regulations of this section are intended to help preserve the citys remaining tree
canopy. By doing so, the regulations help:
A. maintain and enhance the visual character of the city and contribute to economic growth and prosperity;
B. control surface water runoff;
C. improve air quality;
D. moderate temperatures;
E. provide wildlife habitat; and
F. conserve water.
30-12-1.2 Applicability
The tree conservation requirements of this section apply to all of the following unless expressly exempted
pursuant to 30-12-1.3. In addition, a tree disturbance permit or an approved plan, per 30-4-26.3, is required
in association with all of the following:
A. principal buildings or open uses of land developed, constructed, reconstructed, or established after
October 17, 2000;
B. changes in use that result in an increase of 2 or more in the Land Use Classification number, in which case
the tree conservation requirements of this section apply to the entire zone lot;
C. All expansions of buildings, parking areas, or open uses of land, except the first 3,000 square feet of
expansion to buildings, parking areas, or open uses of land existing on October 17, 2000 (Note: the tree
conservation requirements of this section are applicable only to the expansion).
30-12-1.3 Exemptions
All of the following land disturbing activities are exempt from the tree conservation requirements of this
section and the tree disturbance permit requirements of 30-4-26.3:
A. Single-family detached, two-family attached, or duplex dwellings on their own lots.
B. Multi-family developments containing 8 or fewer dwelling units on a single zone lot.
C. Properties within or surrounded by the CB, Central Business district.
D. Tree removal involving the disturbance of 3,000 square feet or less of critical root zone that is not
inconsistent with any plan previously approved by the city or county. The Planning and Community
Development Director is authorized to require reasonable documentation that such removal is not
associated with a forthcoming development proposal and will not be inconsistent with any plan previously
approved by the city or county. Willful violations of the requirement to provide such documentation may
result in the assessment of tree disturbance penalties in accordance with 30-5-5.5.
E. Property covered by an active forestry management plan written by a North Carolina Registered Forester,
provided documentation has been furnished to the Planning and Community Development Director.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 358
Commentary: For the purposes of this section the housing types "Traditional House" and "Zero Lot Line" are
considered single-family detached, the housing type "Twin Home" is considered two-family attached, and the
housing type "Townhouse" is considered multi-family.
30-12-1.4 Conservation of Existing Trees
A. General
Any existing tree or group of trees that meets or exceeds the standards of this subsection may be used to
satisfy the tree conservation requirements of this section. The conservation of stands of trees is strongly
encouraged. The conservation of individual trees is only recommended when saving a specimen tree.
B. Standards
To receive tree conservation credit, trees must be protected from direct and indirect root, trunk and crown
damage or disturbance. The following standards apply:
1. The tree conservation area includes land within the critical root zone. In cases where a tree inventory
has not been submitted, the critical root zone area of the tree conservation area is unknown. In this
case, the critical root zone area of the tree conservation area may be protected by an undisturbed
buffer at least 25 feet in width or as otherwise approved by the Planning and Community Development
Director. The 25-foot undisturbed buffer shall be measured from the trunk of the outermost trees.
Figure 12-1, Tree Conservation Area (25' Buffer)
2. Construction site activities such as parking, material storage, dirt stockpiling, concrete washout and
other similar activities are prohibited within the tree conservation area.
3. Changes to the grade of soil that compromise the tree conservation area by increasing or decreasing
soil moisture content must be avoided.
4. A reasonable effort must be made to have utility line trenches and similar uses avoid the tree
conservation area. Due to certain site conditions, where disturbance within the tree conservation area
is unavoidable, underground tunneling or directional boring of utilities is preferred. Trenching, with the
approval of the Planning and Community Development Director, may be used only as the last
alternative and root pruning equipment specifically designed for that purpose must be used.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 359
5. Protective fencing must be installed around the tree conservation area before any tree disturbing
activities. Such fences must be at least 4 feet in height and must consist of orange polyethylene safety
fencing. Where the tree protection fence and the soil erosion control fence run congruent, the soil
erosion control fence may be substituted for the tree protection fence. Fencing must remain in place
until construction is complete and other landscaping has been installed, and the Planning and
Community Development Director has approved its removal.
6. The tree conservation area must be designated as such with Tree Conservation Area signs posted
visibly on the outside of the fenced-in area. Signs may not be posted on trees.
C. Evaluation of Specimen Trees and Stands of Trees
Existing specimen trees and stands of trees must meet all of the following conditions to be considered for
the tree conservation area:
1. a life expectancy of greater than 10 years;
2. a relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay; and
3. no major insect or pathological problems.
D. Dead or Unhealthy Trees
1. No tree conservation credit will be allowed for any dead tree, any tree in poor health, or any tree
subjected to grade alterations.
2. Maintenance of the tree conservation area is the responsibility of the property owner and/or the
owners association. All dead, dying, or substantially damaged trees shall be replaced at the rate
specified in 30-5-5.5, Table 5-2.
3. The Planning and Community Development Director may require trees left standing outside of the tree
conservation area to be removed if improperly protected or determined to be hazardous.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 360
Figure 12-2, Tree Conservation Area
30-12-1.5 Tree Conservation Area Determination
A. Extent of TCA
Minimum tree conservation area requirements are determined according to parcel size, as set forth in the
following table:
Table 121: Tree Conservation Area Requirements
Area of Parcel
(acres) Required TCA for New Development Required TCA for Expansions
0  1.260 1% of lot size 1% of disturbed area
1.261  5 5% of lot size 5% of disturbed area
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 361
Table 121: Tree Conservation Area Requirements
Area of Parcel
(acres) Required TCA for New Development Required TCA for Expansions
Greater than 5 10% of lot size 10% of disturbed area
Commentary: When development is proposed on a site that does not contain the minimum tree
conservation area, the minimum requirement is to preserve all existing trees. The 50% reforestation
option still applies. On a 10 acre site with only 0.50 acres of existing trees, for example, the owner is
responsible only for preserving the half-acre of trees that do exist, not for planting another half-acre
of trees. Furthermore, the owner could elect to preserve all of the trees or preserve half and reforest
the other half.
B. Trees to be Saved
If trees of 4 inches or greater DBH exist within or partially within tree conservation areas, such trees must
be saved to the extent possible. The area will be designated TCA and may not be disturbed, except as
expressly allowed under this section.
C. Smaller Trees
Trees less than 4 inches DBH within the TCA may be preserved at the landowners option.
D. Other Provisions
The requirements of this section may be modified to permit the establishment of the TCA pursuant to 30-
12-1.6.
E. TCA Selection
In selecting which existing stands of trees are to be designated as TCA, the landowner must give due
consideration to building, parking lot, driveway, street and utility locations as they relate to the practicality
of tree conservation and must use the following tree conservation priority list:
1. First Priority for Conservation
Existing stands of hardwoods growing in or adjacent to stream protection buffers as highest priority
2. Second Priority for Conservation
Existing stands of hardwoods growing on upland sites
3. Third Priority for Conservation
Existing specimen trees (as determined by the Planning and Community Development Director).
4. Fourth Priority for Conservation
Existing stands of hardwoods and pine mix.
5. Fifth Priority for Conservation
Existing stands of pine trees.
F. Activities Allowed in TCA
The following are permitted in the required TCA with prior approval of the Planning and Community
Development Director, provided there is no disturbance to the critical root zone of the preserved trees.
1. Landscaping features including planting boxes, sculpture, arbors, trellises, birdbaths and wood fences,
provided they are installed by hand (no motorized vehicles).
2. Outdoor furniture, ornamental entry columns and gates, flagpoles, lampposts, address posts,
mailboxes, or similar structures.
3. Cornices, steps, canopies, overhanging eaves and gutters, window sills, bay windows or similar
architectural features, fire escapes, fire balconies, and fire towers which project not more than 2.5 feet
into any required TCA.
4. Wheelchair ramps except for porches, walkways, sidewalks, and landings.
5. Steps not connected to any above-grade structure.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 362
6. Trails and greenways, provided they are constructed to minimize disturbance and impacts on the TCA
critical root zone area.
7. Disturbance within the critical root zone will be allowed only on one side of the trees to be saved.
Disturbance to the critical root zone may not exceed 25% of the trees total critical root zone area.
G. Tree Removal Inside the Critical Root Zone (TCA)
Trees less than 4 inches DBH not being preserved, undergrowth and plant material in poor condition may
be removed from the TCA. No roots may be removed from the TCA. Stumps may be removed only by
grinding. All requests for tree removal within the TCA must have prior approval by the Planning and
Community Development Director pursuant to the provisions of this section. However, in an emergency
situation due to storm damage; to alleviate an imminent hazard to the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens; or to repair property damage, prior approval for tree removal in previously approved designated
areas is not required.
H. Certification
All allowed vegetation removal must be done or supervised by an experienced urban forester, landscape
architect or certified arborist, who will certify that the tree and root removal or pruning was done in
accordance with standard arboricultural practices.
30-12-1.6 Tree Conservation Flexibility Standards
A. Undisturbed Stream Buffers
Properties that are required to maintain an undisturbed stream buffer may use some or all the stream
buffer area to satisfy the required TCA if that undisturbed stream buffer contains trees that are a minimum
of 4 inches in diameter at breast height.
B. Land Dedications
Land that is dedicated to the city as open space or drainageway that is contiguous to the property being
developed may be credited towards meeting a sites tree conservation requirements if the dedicated land
contains trees that are a minimum of 4 inches in diameter at breast height. Land contained within
dedicated utility easements may not be credited toward TCA requirements.
C. Reforestation Credits
In situations where TCA requirements cannot be met based on site conditions and when approved by the
Planning and Community Development Director, reforestation efforts on the property can be used to
satisfy up to 50% of the required TCA. See Table 5-2.
D. Alternate Methods of Compliance
See 30-4-11.3(C) and 30-4-11.5(B)1).
E. Reduction of Required Parking
See 30-11-13.7(F).
30-12-1.7 Penalties
See 30-5-5.5.
30-12-1.8 Modifications
The Technical Review Committee is authorized to approve Type 2 Modifications of the standards of this section
in accordance with 30-4-11.
(Amended by Ord. 12-114 on 10/2/12)
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 363
30-12-1.9 Utility Vegetation Management
A. Purpose and Intent
1. The purpose of 30-12-1.9 through 30-12-1.15 of this Ordinance is to establish guidelines for the
routine trimming, pruning, cutting and removal by utility companies of trees and vegetation
(sometimes referred to herein as vegetation maintenance or vegetation management) on public
streets or rights-of-way, City-owned or controlled property, and private property within the City limits
and to encourage the promotion of an urban tree canopy on property within the City limits by ensuring
the following:
a. That the Public safety is protected from any and all trees, limbs and shrubbery which threaten life
and property.
b. That the integrity, structural or otherwise, of individual trees within the Citys tree canopy is
preserved and retained.
c. That the detrimental impact to individual trees within the Citys tree canopy is kept to a minimum
by virtue of vegetation maintenance activities in accordance with the most reasonable,
environmentally safe, and approved International Society of Arborist (ISA) arboricultural practices
under the circumstances.
d. That communication with respect to vegetation management is enhanced between utility
companies, on one hand, and the City, communities and owners or residents of any occupied
public or private property (Occupied Property), on the other hand.
e. That maintained or landscaped, occupied public or private property (referred to hereinafter as
Occupied Maintained Property) receive certain protections with respect to the removal of trees
from those properties.
f. That the provision of safe and reliable overhead utility service is promoted.
g. That overhead utilities are protected while decreasing the potential for service interruptions.
B. Duties of Urban Forester
For the purposes of carrying out the provisions of 30-12-1.9 through 30-12-1.15 of this Ordinance, the
Urban Forester shall be the responsible party to oversee and coordinate utility vegetation management
activities on all trees and vegetation growing within the City limits and the planting, removal, care,
maintenance, and protection thereof. The Urban Forester shall advise on all City-initiated construction
projects in an effort to plan for and manage the Citys vegetative resources.
C. Exceptions
Although it is anticipated that the bulk of utility vegetation maintenance that will occur within the City will
be of a routine nature that is governed by the provisions of 30-12-1.9 through 30-12-1.15 of this
Ordinance, there are certain limited types of vegetation maintenance, as set forth below, that are excepted
from coverage under 30-12-1.9 through 30-12-1.15 of this Ordinance:
1. Although 30-12-1.9 through 30-12-1.15 of this Ordinance apply to overhead electrical distribution lines,
said sections do not apply to nor prohibit vegetation management activities pertaining to:
a. underground electrical distribution lines.
b. electrical transmission lines, or
The term "transmission lines" as it is used herein means electric utility lines in the Duke Energy Carolinas'
service territory energized at voltages greater than 44,000 volts and typically carried on steel poles or
towers; however, some lower voltage transmission lines may be on wood pole structures.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 364
2. 30-12-1.9 through 30-12-1.15 of this Ordinance do not apply to nor prohibit vegetation management
activities pertaining to non-routine vegetation management which includes, without limitation,
customer requested work (such as construction projects where new service lines are requested or
projects where lines need to be relocated or extended), maintenance of overhead facilities (such as
changing out transformers, other pole-mounted equipment or damaged or rotten poles), North
Carolina Department of Transportation related work, addressing public safety incidents, or restoring
the utility service following emergencies or any other unanticipated interruption or outage.
3. 30-12-1.9 through 30-12-1.15 of this Ordinance shall not apply to nor prohibit the vegetation
maintenance of any tree or shrub on public or private property within the City limits, if such vegetation
maintenance is done in order to repair or replace the same as a result of damage or deterioration as a
result of accident, casualty, or natural elements such as wind, rain, ice, electrical storm, or the like.
D. Legality of Chapter or Parts Thereof
Should any section, clause or provision of 30-12-1.9 through 30-12-1.15 of this Ordinance be declared by
the courts to be invalid, the same shall not affect the validity of any other provision of 30-12-1.9 through
30-12-1.15 of this Ordinance.
E. Violations; Stop Work Orders
If a utility does not comply with 30-12-1.9 through 30-12-1.15 of this Ordinance, then the Urban Forester
is authorized to issue a stop work order to the utility.
(Amended by Ord. 13-73 on 6/18/13)
30-12-1.10 Annual Vegetation Management Plan
A. Each utility company shall submit an annual vegetative management plan to the Urban Forester of the City
on or before January 1st of each year prior to the start of any overhead utility vegetation maintenance
activities within the City limits or upon any City-owned or controlled property, which vegetative
management plan shall:
1. depict the general areas involved in the maintenance plan, and
2. set forth the maintenance schedule for vegetation line maintenance within the Citys limits.
If the vegetative management plan is timely submitted and the vegetative management plan sets forth the
information required in this sub-section, then the vegetative management plan shall be accepted within 10
business days following the submission of it to the City.
B. If a utility company desires to amend its vegetative management plan at any time during the year, the
utility company shall submit an amended annual vegetative management plan to the Urban Forester of the
City, which amended vegetative management plan shall:
1. depict the general areas involved in the maintenance plan, and
2. set forth the maintenance schedule for vegetation line maintenance within the Citys limits.
If the amended vegetative management plan sets forth the information required in this sub-section, then the
amended vegetative management plan shall be accepted within 10 business days following the submission of
it to the City.
C. Operational Plan
1. If a utility desires to perform vegetation maintenance within the City limits or upon any City-owned or
controlled property, then the utility company shall obtain the acceptance of an operational plan before
commencing any such desired vegetation maintenance. After the submission of an annual vegetative
management plan, each utility company shall submit an operational plan to the Urban Forester of the
City depicting in specific detail the circuits, locations, and timing involved in the line maintenance 60
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 365
days prior to commencement of work, unless a shorter period of time is mutually agreed upon by the

30-12-1.12 Vegetation Management Standards, Requirements and
Prohibited Practices
A. Methods of Pruning, Trimming and Cutting; Prohibited Practices
1. To the extent the utility files a vegetative management plan with the North Carolina Utilities
Commission, then the vegetative management plan, including the Old Design Urban Circuits, which
was filed with the North Carolina Utilities Commission on April 30, 2013 as a supplement to its
vegetative management plan, and any revisions to the vegetation management plan required by the
North Carolina Utilities Commission shall constitute the standards to be adhered to by the utility when
performing vegetation management activities within the City limits. The most recent utility vegetation
management plan, including the Old Design Urban Circuits which was filed with the North Carolina
Utilities Commission on April 30, 2013 as a supplement to its vegetative management plan filed with
the North Carolina Utilities Commission, may be found by accessing the links below:

The utility shall provide the City of Greensboros City Attorney with notice of any proposed revision to its
vegetative management plan, including the Old Design Urban Circuits, which was filed with the NCUC on
April 30, 2013 as a supplement to its vegetative management plan, that would impact its distribution
system at the same time that it files such proposed revision with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.
2. Regardless of whether a utility files a vegetative management plan with the North Carolina Utilities
Commission, a utility shall comply with the following in connection with any vegetation maintenance
within the City limits:
a. No obvious hangers shall be left in the trees after performing line clearance activities. The term
hanger limb, as used herein, means a cut limb that is left in a tree after pruning operations are
complete.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 367
b. Limbs shall be pruned back to an appropriate new leader, heading away or around the lines. In no
circumstances are stubs or abruptly pruned limbs to be left by the pruning. The term leader, as
used herein, means a dominant upright stem which is usually the main trunk of a tree.
c. Utility companies shall use natural pruning which requires all cuts to be made at laterals (limb
junctions). These lateral limbs shall be no less than one-third the diameter of the limb removed at
the point of removal. The term lateral limb, as used herein, means a subordinate limb originating
from a main branch or stem.
d. For the removal of a limb the triple cut method shall be used if there is a possibility that the limb
may tear out from the trunk if a single cut is made.
e. When virulent disease is prevalent, as per written notification of the Urban Forester, the Urban
Forester will work with the utility to develop a reasonable plan to properly prune or remove the
subject tree. This plan will be designed to prevent the spread of disease as a result of line
clearance activities.
f. Under normal circumstances, no more than one-fourth of a trees crown shall be removed per
year. If reduction of more than one-fourth or 25 percent of a trees crown is needed for safety and
reliability clearances, or if the tree is otherwise a danger tree, the tree should be evaluated by the
utility company for removal. The term danger tree, as it is used in 30-12-1.9 through 30-12-1.15 of
this Ordinance, means a tree that has the potential of adversely impacting utility service by falling
into a utility line as a result of being cut, blown into, or otherwise falling, by virtue of its physical
condition.
g. The use of tree paint, wound dressing, and the like is not recommended.
h. Climbing irons, spurs, or spikes are not to be used unless in accordance with the ANSI A300
standard.
i. Topping and rounding over of trees is prohibited.
j. Vegetation maintenance shall be done using the ANSI A300 method (part 1) BMP manual
compiled by the International Society of Arboriculture, and subsequent revisions.
B. Determinations by Utility Companies That a Tree Is To Be Removed; Appeal Process
1. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude, prevent, or impair any property owner,
resident, the City or utility from pursuing its legal remedies before the North Carolina Utilities
Commission or from requesting the assistance of the Public Staff of the North Carolina Utilities
Commission formally or informally at any time pursuant to the procedures set forth by those agencies.
2. If a utility company determines that a tree must be removed in its entirety from Occupied Maintained
Property within the City limits, then the utility company shall make reasonable efforts to seek the
consent of the owner or resident of the Occupied Maintained Property. Reasonable efforts by a utility
company to seek the consent of the owner or resident of the Occupied Maintained Property may
include any of the following, without limitation:
a. a request for consent to remove a tree set forth on a door hanger;
b. a request for consent to remove a tree made in a communication with said owner or resident;
c. a request for consent to remove a tree set forth in a message left on the answering machine or
voicemail of said owner or resident;
d. a request for consent to remove a tree set forth in a letter served by mail to said owner or
resident;
e. a request for consent to remove a tree made during a meeting with said owner or resident on the
affected property; or
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 368
f. a request for consent to remove a tree served by email to said owner or resident.
If an owner or resident of Occupied Maintained Property expresses verbally or in writing to the utility
company that said owner or resident does not consent to the tree removal intended by the utility
company, then the utility company shall not remove the subject tree unless permitted to do so by the
Urban Forester or the North Carolina Utilities Commission or through resolution of the matter through the
involvement of the Consumer Services Division of the Public Staff of the North Carolina Utilities
Commission, as provided for herein below.
3. If:
a. an owner or resident of the Occupied Maintained Property expresses in writing or verbally that said
owner or resident does not consent to removal of the tree desired to be removed by the utility
company, or
b. said owner or resident fails to express verbally or in writing a position with respect to consent
within 5 business days of when the utility company first made its reasonable efforts to seek
consent, unless a shorter time is reasonably necessary in light of the immediate danger and/or
interference to the overhead utility lines posed by the subject tree; then, in either situation, the
utility company may request that the Urban Forester issue a written determination as to whether a
tree in dispute on public or private property shall be removed, and the following shall govern the
process and determination by the Urban Forester:
i. The Urban Forester shall rule that the tree in dispute shall be removed if the Urban Forester
determines that the tree is a danger tree as defined above in 30-12-1.12(A) 2) e).

communicated that consent for removal was not being provided, if any such request was
provided.
iii. Within 5 business days of the request by the utility company, unless a shorter time is
reasonably necessary in light of the immediate danger and/or interference to the overhead
utility lines posed by the subject tree, the Urban Forester shall conduct a meeting with the
owner or resident of the Occupied Maintained Property and utility company at the property
where the tree in dispute is located. The date and time of the meeting shall be determined by
and communicated by the Urban Forester by telephone or by written notice served by mail,
email or hand-delivery. At the meeting, the utility company may explain why the tree in
dispute should be removed and the owner or the resident of the Occupied Maintained Property
may explain why the tree should not be removed.
iv. Regardless of when a meeting is conducted or whether a meeting actually is conducted, the
Urban Forester shall make a written determination of whether the tree in dispute shall be
removed within 5 business days of service of the initial Written Request for Determination to
the Urban Forester (the 5 Day Deadline for the Urban Forester to Make a Determination).
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 369
v. A written determination by the Urban Forester (the Written Determination of the Urban

(Amended by Ord. 13-73 on 6/18/13)
30-12-2 Flood Damage Prevention
30-12-2.1 General
A. Authority
The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in NCGS Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; NCGS Parts 3,
5, and 8 of Article 19 of Chapter 160A, and NCGS Article 8 of 160A delegated to local governmental units
the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
B. Purposes
The flood damage prevention regulations, adopted and prescribed in this section, are found by the City
Council to be necessary and appropriate to:
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 372
1. permit only that development within the floodplain which is appropriate in light of the probability of
flood damage and which represents a reasonable social and economic use of land in relation to the
hazards involved; and
2. minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by enactment of
provisions designed to:
3. restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion
hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
4. require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against
flood damage at the time of initial construction;
5. control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are
involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
6. control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development which may increase erosion or flood
damage;
7. prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which
may increase flood hazards to other lands;
8. protect human life and health;
9. minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
10. minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at
the expense of the general public;
11. minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
12. minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water, sewer, gas, electric, cable and
telephone lines, trails, boardwalks, streets, and bridges located in flood prone areas;
13. help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas;
14. permit and encourage the retention of open land uses that will be so located and designed as to
constitute a harmonious and appropriate part of the physical development of the community and that
will not impede the flow of floodwaters; and
15. ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area or future
conditions flood hazard area.
C. Reason for Regulation of Flood Prone Areas
The flood prone areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation that could result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
D. Causes of Flood Losses
Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of:
1. obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and
2. occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
E. Applicability
The flood damage prevention regulations of this section apply to all areas of special flood hazard and
future conditions flood hazard areas within the city and its extra-territorial jurisdiction.
F. Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard and Future Conditions Flood Hazard
Areas
The special flood hazard areas and future conditions flood hazard areas are those identified under the
Cooperating Technical state agreement between the State of North Carolina and FEMA in its flood
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 373
insurance study (FIS) and its accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), for Guilford County dated
June 18, 2007, which are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations.
G. Permits and Certificates
1. Application for Permit
Application for a floodplain development permit must be made in accordance with 30-4-26.6.
2. Certificate of Floor Elevation/Floodproofing
When a property is located in a special flood hazard area or when a structure is floodproofed, a
certificate must be provided in accordance with 30-4-26.10.
H. Notification, Remedies and Penalties For Violations
When a violation of any provision of this section is discovered by the Planning and Community
Development Director, notification to the owner or occupant of the land, building, structure, sign, or use of
the violation shall be made in accordance with 30-5-3. Any or all of the remedies listed in 30-5-4 may be
used to enforce the provisions of this section. Additionally, any person who violates any provision of this
section shall be subject to the assessment of a civil penalty under the procedures provided in [@@71].
I. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Actual
flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. The establishment of these regulations is
not intended to indicate or imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard and future conditions
flood hazard areas, or uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. These
regulations shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damages that results from reliance on the flood prevention regulations of this section or any administrative
decision lawfully made hereunder.
30-12-2.2 Permitted and Prohibited Structures and Activities
Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within the special flood hazard areas
established in 30-12-2.1(F). The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due
to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles and have erosion potential. The
following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in 30-12-2.3(A) and 30-12-2.3(B) shall apply to all
development within such areas:
A. No encroachments, including but not limited to, fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other
developments shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated that:
1. The proposed encroachments will not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the
base flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice and presented to the Water Resources Director prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, or
2. A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion of the proposed encroachment.
B. If subsection (A) (immediately above) is satisfied, all development must comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of this section.
C. No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement manufactured homes in an existing
manufactured dwelling park or subdivision, provided the following provisions are met:
1. The anchoring and the elevation standards of 30-12-2.3(B)3); and
2. The no encroachment standard of subsection (A), above is satisfied.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 374
30-12-2.3 Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction
A. General Standards
In all areas of special flood hazard and future conditions flood hazard areas the following provisions are
required:
1. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure;
2. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility
equipment resistant to flood damage;
3. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that
minimize flood damages;
4. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities
shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding. These include, but are not limited to, HVAC equipment,

8. Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure that is in compliance with the
provisions of the flood prevention regulations of this section shall meet the requirement of new
construction as contained in this section;
9. Nothing in this section shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of a building or
structure existing on the effective date of the flood prevention regulations of this section and located
totally or partially within the floodway, non-encroachment area, or stream setback, provided there is
no additional encroachment below the regulatory flood protection elevation in the floodway, nonencroachment
area, or stream setback, and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or replacement
meets all of the other requirements of the flood prevention regulations of this section.
10. New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards,
and chemical storage facilities shall not be permitted, except by variance as specified in 30-4-13.6. A

that is below the lowest floor and is subject to flooding:
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 377
a. Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only be used for the parking of
vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the
premises. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of
vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the
premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior
portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms, except to
enclose storage areas;
b. Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials below the regulatory flood protection
elevation; and
c. Shall include in Zones A, AO, AE, AH, A1-A30, and X (Future) flood openings to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs
for complying with this requirement must be either certified by a registered professional engineer
or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
i. Provide a minimum of 2 flood openings on different sides of each enclosed area subject to
flooding having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding;
ii. If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed area must have flood openings
to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit;
iii. The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher than one foot above the adjacent
grade;
iv. Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided
they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; and
v. Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for regulatory purposes,
and, therefore, do not require flood openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of
structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires flood openings in accordance with
30-12-2.3(B)5)a), 30-12-2.3(B)5)b) and 30-12-2.3(B)5)c).
6. Additions/Improvements
a. Where the additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures, in combination with any interior
modifications to the existing structure are not a substantial improvement, the additions and/or
improvements shall be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more
nonconforming than the existing structure.
b. Where the additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures, in combination with any interior
modifications to the existing structure are a substantial improvement, the additions and/or
improvements, for both the existing structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply
with the standards for new construction.
c. Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the existing structure other than a
standard door in the common wall shall require only the addition to comply with the standards for
new construction.
d. Where the addition and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures, in combination with any interior
modifications to the existing structure are not a substantial improvement, only the addition shall
comply with the standards for new construction.
e. Where the addition and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures, in combination with any interior
modifications to the existing structure are a substantial improvement, both the existing structure
and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new construction.
7. Temporary Nonresidential Structures
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 378
Prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure(s) in the event of a
hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning notification. The following information shall be
submitted in writing to the Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
a. A specified time period for which the temporary use will be permitted. Time specified may not
exceed 3 months, renewable up to one year;
b. The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible for the removal of the

2.1(F) where no base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the following provisions,
in addition to 30-12-2.3(A) apply within such areas for all new construction and substantial
improvements:
2. No encroachment, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or new development
shall be permitted within a distance of 30 feet each side from the top of the stream bank or 5 times
the width of the stream, whichever is greater, unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in
any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
3. The base flood elevation (BFE) used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be
determined based on the following:
a. All subdivision, manufactured dwelling site and other development proposals shall provide base
flood elevation (BFE) data if development is greater than 5 acres or has more than 50
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 379
lots/manufactured dwelling sites. Such base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by
reference per 30-12-2.1(F) to be utilized in implementing this section.
b. When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other sources, all new construction and
substantial improvements within such areas shall comply with the provisions of 30-12-2.3(B) for
elevation (or floodproofing of nonresidential structures) and non-elevation design requirements as
well as certification requirements.
c. When base flood elevation data is not available from a federal, state, or other source as outlined in
30-12-2.3(C)2)b), the reference level shall be elevated no lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. All non elevation design and certification requirements of 30-12-2.3(B) shall
also apply.
4. When floodway or no encroachment area data is available from other sources, in addition to the base
flood elevation data, from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within
such areas shall comply with the provisions of 30-12-2.2(A) for encroachment requirements as well as
those of 30-12-2.3(B) for elevation (or floodproofing of nonresidential structures) and non-elevation
design requirements as well as certification requirements for both.
D. Standards for Riverine Floodplains with BFE but without Established Floodways or Non-
Encroachment Areas
Along rivers and streams where BFE data is provided but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas
are identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS report, the following requirements
shall apply to all development within such areas:
1. Standards outlined in 30-12-2.3(A) and 30-12-2.3(B); and
2. Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development, shall be permitted unless
certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community.
E. Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO Zones)
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in 30-12-2.1(F) are areas designated as
shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to
3 feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate. In addition to 30-12-2.3(A), all new construction and substantial improvement, shall meet
the following requirements:
1. The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth number specified on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a freeboard of one foot above the highest adjacent grade. If
no depth number is specified, reference level shall be elevated at least 2 feet above the highest
adjacent grade plus a freeboard of one foot.
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall:
a. Have the reference level elevated at least as high as the depth number specified on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a freeboard of one foot above the highest adjacent
grade. If no depth number is specified, reference level shall be elevated at least 2 feet above the
highest adjacent grade plus a freeboard of one foot; or
b. Be completely floodproofed, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, to or above that
level required in 30-12-2.3(E)2)a) so that the structure below that level is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is
required as per 30-4-26.10 and 30-12-2.3(B)2).
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 380
F. Standards for Intermittent and Perennial Streams Without Established Special Flood Hazard
Areas
Along intermittent and perennial streams where no special flood hazard area has been identified on the
FIRM or in the FIS report, the following provisions shall apply to all development within such areas:
1. Except for streets, bridges, and utilities, no encroachments shall be permitted in drainage maintenance
and utility easements as required by the subdivision standards of Article 13 unless granted an
easement release. Except for streets, bridges, and utilities, no encroachment, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 30
feet each side from the top of the stream bank or 5 times the width of the stream, whichever is
greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is
provided demonstrating the impact of such encroachments on flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge. The degree of such impact shall be reviewed and subject to approval by the
Water Resources Director prior to the commencement of any development activities.
2. If base flood elevation data is available from other sources, all new construction and substantial
improvements within such areas shall comply with all applicable flood hazard area provisions of this
section and shall have the lowest floor, including basement and attendant mechanical equipment,
elevated or floodproofed to the base flood elevation plus one foot of freeboard. Elevation or
floodproofing certification is required in accordance with 30-4-26.10 if the lowest adjacent grade to the
structure is less than 5 feet above the base flood elevation. All non elevation design and certification
requirements of 30-12-2.3(B) shall also apply.
3. When base flood elevation data is not available from a federal, state, or other source, the base flood
elevation shall be calculated by a registered professional engineer, in accordance with standard
engineering practice and direction from the city. All new construction and substantial improvements
within such areas shall comply with all applicable flood hazard area provisions of this section. The
lowest floor, including basement and attendant mechanical equipment, shall be elevated or
floodproofed to the higher of the base flood elevation plus one foot of freeboard or 2 feet above the
highest adjacent grade. Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, elevation or floodproofing
certification is required in accordance with 30-4-26.10 if the lowest adjacent grade to the structure is
less than 5 feet above the base flood elevation. All non elevation design and certification requirements
of 30-12-2.3(B) shall also apply.
30-12-2.4 Amendments to the Flood Insurance Rate Map
A. Grounds for Revisions and Amendments
The location of any floodway or area of special flood hazard may be amended by FEMA in cases where:
1. A flood control project of the federal, state, county, or city government has substantially altered the
flood hazard; or
2. Flood data indicates that the boundaries as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map are no longer
correct; or
3. A private individual, corporation, firm, or governmental agency has submitted plans to the appropriate
local authority, state agencies, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for a channel
improvement or relocation, street or bridge that would affect the location of the existing flood zone
boundaries as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
B. No Impact Certification
A No Impact Certification approved by the city, including the required review fee, shall be evidence that
a conditional FIRM revision is not required for the development covered by the certification.
C. Revision as a Prerequisite
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 381
Approval from FEMA of a Flood Insurance Rate Map amendment is a prerequisite for a Floodplain
Development Permit in the situations described below. The permit applicant must prepare and submit the
FIRM revision package, including the required review fees, to the city upon completion of the
development.
1. Whenever a proposed channel improvement or relocation will occur;
2. Any fill or development activity is proposed in a special flood hazard area without an established
floodway or non-encroachment area that results in an increase in the base flood elevation more than
one foot in accordance with 30-12-2.3(D)2); and
3. Encroachment into a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area that results in any increase in the
water surface elevation in accordance with 30-12-2.2(A).
30-12-3 Water Supply Watershed and Other Watershed Districts
30-12-3.1 District Descriptions
Two overlay districts cover designated water supply watersheds. They are the Watershed Critical Area (WCA)
and the General Watershed Area (GWA). The WCA covers the area adjacent to a water supply intake or
reservoir where risk associated with pollution is greater than from the remaining portions of the watershed.
WCA outer boundaries are at least one-half mile from the normal pool elevation of an existing or proposed
designated reservoir. The GWA covers the rest of the watershed draining to the reservoir or intake. The
remaining areas within the citys jurisdiction are hereby referred to as Other Watershed Districts .
(Amended by Ord. 10-161 on 12/1/10)
30-12-3.2 Purpose and Intent
A. General Intent
The watershed protection regulations, adopted and prescribed in this ordinance, to protect the public
health are found by the City Council to be necessary and appropriate to:
1. Protect stream buffers, water supply watersheds and other watersheds from activities that could
degrade water quality in the reservoirs and streams;
2. Reduce the volume of nutrients and other chemicals that could enter streams and the water supply by
reducing the amount of runoff that any given development will generate;
3. Minimize land disturbance to reduce the amount of sediment washing into streams and lakes and to
enhance the infiltration of runoff into soils, thus alleviating the sedimentation of water supply lakes
that reduces their storage capacity, shortens their useful life, and makes them less able to withstand
drought;
4. Reduce the probability of the release of harmful chemicals into streams and water supply reservoirs,
either through natural catastrophe or human error;
5. Provide for natural and engineered methods for managing the stormwater that flushes contaminants
off of built-upon areas in the water supply watersheds and other watersheds that may reach water
supply reservoirs and streams unless controlled.
6. To require that new development maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in its postdevelopment
state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding,
streambank erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and to
maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; and
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 382
7. To establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural and
nonstructural stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) to ensure that they continue to function
as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no threat to public safety.
B. -WCA- Watershed Critical Area
The -WCA, Watershed Critical Area overlay district establishes regulations for protecting the portion of a
water supply watershed adjacent to a water supply intake or reservoir.
C. -GWA- General Watershed Area
The -GWA, General Watershed Area overlay district establishes regulations for protecting the portion of a
water supply watershed outside the -WCA.
(Amended by Ord. 10-161 on 12/1/10)
30-12-3.3 Incorporation of Designated Watershed Map(s)
This section incorporates by reference the Greensboro Designated Watershed Map, dated June 1, 2009,
showing Watershed Critical Areas and General Watershed Areas of the following: Greensboro (Reedy Fork
Creek), Upper Randleman Lake (East and West Forks of Deep River, which drain to High Point City Lake and
Oak Hollow Lake), Lower Randleman Lake (Deep River), Lake Mackintosh (Big Alamance Creek), and Polecat
Creek watersheds. The map also depicts boundaries of the Other Watershed Districts.
(Amended by Ord. 10-161 on 12/1/10)
30-12-3.4 Applicability
A. Coverage
1. This section (30-12-3) applies to all sites containing new development in the citys jurisdiction ,
including grading, paving, gravel placement, and construction of buildings and other structures, except
for the exempt activities listed in 30-12-3.4(B). 30-12-4 and 30-12-5 impose additional requirements
specific to the overlay district. 30-12-3.9 applies to all activities in the city's jurisdiction.
2. The construction of new streets, the widening of existing streets and the installation of sidewalks shall
comply with the provisions of this Article to the extent practicable. When it is determined by the Water
Resources Director that the provisions of these sections cannot be met, the construction of new
streets, the widening of existing streets and the installation of sidewalks shall comply with all
applicable state and federal rules and regulations.
B. Exempt Activities
The following activities are exempt from the plan submission and approval requirements of this section.
However, any restrictions upon building location, drainageways, pavement, or other built-upon area, or
any other matter appearing on any previously approved watershed development (watershed control) or
stormwater management plan covering the subject property, shall be complied with unless and until
replaced by an approved revised plan.
1. Construction of a single-family dwelling and its accessory structures on a lot of record created outside
WCA Tiers 1 and 2 prior to July 1, 1993.
2. Replacement of existing built-upon area with a like or lesser amount of new built-upon area outside
any required stream buffer on the same lot, provided that the Water Resources Director has
determined that equal or improved stormwater management will result.
3. Except as provided in subsection (1) above, placement of small accessory buildings or structures or
small amounts of other built-upon area provided that the total additional built-upon area is no greater
than 400 square feet and the additional built-upon area is not placed within a required stream buffer.
This exemption shall apply to a lot for one time only after June 30, 1993.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 383
4. Existing development until such time as new development is initiated on the site.
5. Activities exempt from permit requirements of Section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, as specified
in 40 CFR 232 are exempt from watershed regulations of this section. Stream buffer regulations for
ongoing farming and forestry activities will be implemented and enforced by the Division of Water
Quality).
C. Modifications
The provisions of this section (30-12-3) are eligible for Modification in accordance with 30-4-11. The
evaluation of requests for modifications of watershed regulations involves both technical evaluations
(normally conducted by the Enforcement Officer and the Technical Review Committee) and evaluations
made in light of both water supply watershed protection policies and fundamental fairness (normally
conducted by the Planning Board and City Council). The approval procedure shall be as follows:
1. Watershed Modification that is Minor in Nature
Modification of the watershed regulations of 30-12-3, 30-12-4 or 30-12-5 that meets one of the
following criteria: (A) Modification of any standard of Article 12 but not in the EMC Rules; (B)
Modification of any standard on which the level of performance required by Article 12 exceeds that
required by the corresponding section of the EMC Rules, provided that approval of the modification
does not lower the level of performance below that required by the EMC Rules; or (C) Activities that
will impact only Zone 2 of the stream buffer; or (D) Modification from the EMC Rules that results in a
relaxation, by a factor of up to 5%, of density, or built-upon area requirement under the high-density
option; or that results in a relaxation, by a factor of up to 10%, of any management requirement
under the low-density option, shall be considered minor in nature.
a. For properties located within General Watershed Areas (GWA) and Watershed Critical Areas
(WCA), the Technical Review Committee may grant a Type 2 modification to allow the treatment of
untreated off-site runoff in exchange for not treating up to 5% of built-upon area but not to
exceed 24,000 square feet of on-site runoff that is considered difficult to control in accordance
with 30-4-11. This percentage is based on total on-site BUA vs. BUA not treated by a BMP.
b. For properties located within General Watershed Areas (GWA) and Other Watershed Districts, the
Planning Board may grant a Type 3 Modification to the Standards of watershed regulations in
accordance with 30-4-11.
c. For properties located within the Watershed Critical Areas (WCA), the City Council may grant a
Type 4 Modification to the Standards of the watershed regulations in accordance with 30-4-11.
2. Watershed Modification that is Major in Nature
Modification of the watershed regulations of 30-12-3, 30-12-4 or 30-12-5 that do not meet the criteria
for a Watershed Modification that is Minor in Nature are considered major in nature. Recognizing that
these types of modifications are only approvable in unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis by
the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC) pursuant to Section .0104(r) of the
EMC Rules, the EMC may grant a Type 5 Modification to the Standards of the watershed regulations in
accordance with 30-4-11. Any modification of the stream buffer regulations of 30-12-3.9 is considered
a Type 5 modification.
a. A Type 5 modification request pertains to activities that will impact any portion of Zone 1 or any
portion of both Zones 1 and 2 of the riparian protection area. If the city has determined that a
Type 5 modification request meets the requirements of this section, then it shall prepare a
preliminary finding and submit it to the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission for
approval. Within 90 days after receipt by the city, the Environmental Management Commission
shall review preliminary findings on the Type 5 request and take one of the following actions:
approve, approve with conditions and stipulations, or deny the request.
b. Appeals from a NC Environmental Management Commission decision on a Type 5 modification
request are made on judicial review to Superior Court.

A. Where Permitted
Where a regional stormwater control program has been established by one or more local governments, or
by an authority operating on behalf of one or more local governments, a development may participate in
that regional program in lieu of any certification of runoff control required by this article, provided that all
of the following conditions are met:
1. Stormwater runoff from the development drains to an approved existing or proposed public regional
stormwater control facility that is currently operational or will be operational within 2 years;
2. Participation is in the form of contribution of funds, contribution of land, contribution of stormwater
management facility construction work, or a combination of these, the total value of which must be in
accordance with a fee schedule adopted by the City Council; and
3. The Technical Review Committee finds that the stormwater management plan is in compliance with all
other applicable requirements of this section.
B. Use of Contributions

30-12-3.8 Clustering
A. Clustering Encouraged
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 387
Clustering of residential development is encouraged. Clustering of single-family detached development is
allowed under the provisions of 30-7-3.3. Multi-family development may be clustered so long as the
development complies with the applicable standards of 30-8-10.
B. Performance Requirements
Clustering is allowed if the overall density of the project meets the applicable GWA or WCA density and
stormwater runoff control requirements, the built-upon areas are designed and sited to minimize
stormwater runoff impact to the receiving waters and minimize concentrated stormwater flow, and the
remainder of the tract remains in a vegetated or natural state.
C. Additional Requirements in all Watersheds
1. Development shall maximize the use of diffuse flow through vegetated areas and shall maximize the
flow length through vegetated areas.
2. Areas of concentrated development shall be located in upland areas and away, to the maximum extent
practicable, from surface waters and drainageways.
3. In the Randleman Watershed, the remainder of the tract to remain in a vegetated or natural state shall
be conveyed to an owners association, conveyed to a local government for preservation as a park or
greenway, conveyed to a conservation organization, or placed in a permanent conservation or
farmland preservation easement. A document recorded at the Register of Deeds shall require
maintenance of the vegetated or natural area.
4. To the extent that this can be accomplished consistent with other requirements of this ordinance, builtupon
area shall be minimized to the maximum extent practical through clustering and narrower and
shorter paved areas (streets, driveways, sidewalks, and parking lots). Rooftop and other built-upon
area runoff shall be spread over pervious areas.
5. Land clearing during the construction process shall be limited to the maximum extent practical.
6. The developer shall record deed restrictions and protective covenants to ensure that development
activities maintain the development consistent with the approved plans and specifications.
(Amended by Ord. 10-161 on 12/1/10)
30-12-3.9 Stream Buffers Required
A. Stream Buffer Widths
Stream buffers containing zones and widths as specified in the Stream Buffer Zone and Width
Requirements in Table 12-4, below shall be provided and maintained throughout the citys jurisdiction.
(See 30-12-4 for additional requirements concerning stream buffers in the WCA).
B. Vegetated Conveyances
When the low-density option is used, stormwater runoff shall be transported primarily by vegetated
conveyances. Diffuse flow shall be maintained within the stream buffers.
C. Stream Channelization
Approval from the Technical Review Committee, NC Division of Water Quality, and U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers shall be secured before any intermittent or perennial stream is disturbed. Additionally, if the
stream is in a WCA, it shall not be channelized without prior approval of a Type 3 Modification by the
Planning Board in accordance with 30-4-11. Evaluation of the channelization request shall be based on
grounds for a modification and mitigation may be required.
D. Platting of Stream Buffers
Subdivision plats and pond plats shall show each stream buffer and zone applicable to the property.
E. Diffuse Flow Requirement
In all watersheds, diffuse flow of runoff shall be maintained in the stream buffer by dispersing
concentrated flow prior to its entry into the buffer and reestablishing vegetation as follows:
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 388
1. Concentrated runoff from new ditches or man-made conveyances shall be converted to diffuse flow at
non-erosive velocities before the runoff enters Zone 2 of the riparian protection area;
2. Periodic corrective action to restore diffuse flow shall be taken by the landowner if necessary to
impede the formation of erosion gullies; and
3. As set out in 30-12-3.9(F) and Table 12-5, the zones of the stream buffer and Table of Stream Buffer
Activities and Structures respectively, no new stormwater conveyances are allowed through the buffers
except for those specified in Table 12-5, addressing stormwater management ponds, drainage ditches,
roadside ditches, and stormwater conveyances.
F. Explanation of Stream Buffer Zones
Perennial and intermittent stream buffers must be composed of 2 or 3 of the following zones, depending
upon whether the low-density option or the high-density option is used.
1. Zone 1 is the portion of a riparian protection area located closest to the stream, lake, reservoir, or
pond. It is intended to be an undisturbed area of vegetation except for activities and structures
provided for in Table 12-5 Stream Buffer Activities and Structures in all Watersheds (30-12-3.9(G)3)).
The location of Zone 1 shall be as follows:
a. For intermittent and perennial streams, Zone 1 shall begin at the top of the bank and extend
landward a distance of 30 feet on all sides of the surface water, measured horizontally on a line
perpendicular to a vertical line marking the top of the bank. For ponds, lakes and reservoirs
located within a natural drainage way, Zone 1 shall begin at the normal water level and extend
landward a distance of 30 feet, measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to a vertical line
marking the normal water level. No new built-upon area is to be placed in this zone.
2. Zone 2, the remainder of a riparian protection area, is intended to provide protection through a
vegetated riparian zone which provides for diffusion and infiltration of runoff and filtering of pollutants.
Zone 2 shall consist of a stable, vegetated area that is undisturbed except for activities and structures
provided for in Table 12-5 (30-12-3.9(G)3)). Grading and revegetating in Zone 2 is allowed provided
that the health of the vegetation in Zone 1 is not compromised. Zone 2 shall begin at the outer edge
of Zone 1 and extend landward 20 feet as measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface
water. The combined width of Zone 1 and 2 shall be 50 feet on all sides of the surface water. No new
built-upon area is to be placed in this zone.
3. Zone 3 is not part of a riparian protection area and therefore is subject to less extensive requirements
than Zones 1 and 2. Zone 3 covers the outermost 50 feet of the 100-foot perennial stream buffer
under the high-density option. No new built upon area is to be placed in this zone. (See 30-12-4 for
additional requirements concerning stream buffers in the WCA)

A. Designated Agencies
The following are the designated agencies responsible for implementing the requirements of the EMC
Rules for the specified activities:
1. Agriculture - Guilford Soil and Water Conservation District
2. Silviculture - NC Division of Forest Resources
B. Transportation
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 398
The North Carolina Department of Transportation shall comply with the practices outlined in its document
entitled Best Management Practices for the Protection of Surface Waters, which is incorporated by
reference.

Planning Committee (LEPC) are the designated management agencies responsible for implementing
the provisions of this subsection pertaining to hazardous materials.
2. An inventory of all hazardous materials used and stored in the watershed shall be maintained. A
spill/failure containment plan and appropriate safeguards against contamination are required. Waste
minimization and appropriate recycling of materials is encouraged.
3. Properties in the WCA or GWA shall comply with the requirements of the Superfund Amendments and

substances) if hazardous substances listed in either of these sections are stored or used on the site.
(Amended by Ord. 10-161 on 12/1/10)
30-12-3.11 Density
A. Density Limits
New development shall not exceed the density limits in Table 12-6 (Density Limits in Upper and Lower
Randleman Lake Watersheds) or Table 12-7 (Density Limits in Other Water Supply Watersheds, and Other
Watershed Districts), whichever is applicable, except as provided in Subsection (D) below.
B. Measurement in Low-density Option
For the low-density option, density is measured in dwelling units per acre for single-family detached
residential development; for recreational facilities such as golf courses and tennis and swim clubs lying
within such developments, measure the built-upon area on the lot or common elements and divide by
3,000 square feet to obtain a dwelling units equivalency number. Density is measured in percentage of the
land surface covered by built-upon area for all other residential and nonresidential development. When
buildings for single-family detached residential uses and buildings for other uses are intermingled, the
built-upon area measurement shall apply. When sections devoted to single-family detached residential
buildings and other sections devoted to buildings for other uses are present in the same development, the
developer may apply the appropriate measurements to the different uses or may use the built-upon area
measurement for the entire development. When using the built-upon area measurement, assume 3,000
square feet of built-upon area per single-family detached residential lot to cover the built-upon area on the
lot and in the portion of its driveway within the street right-of-way.
C. Measurement in High-density Option
The built-upon area measurement shall apply.
D. Density Averaging
When all of the following conditions are met, two non-contiguous zone lots, neither of which is publicly
held land, may be treated in tandem for compliance with the density requirements contained within this
section. Publicly held lands include but are not limited to dedicated drainageway and open space, parkland,
or other lands obtained for watershed protection. One lot (the giving lot) shall reduce its allowable
development, and the other lot (the receiving lot) shall increase its allowable development by a like
amount.
1. An Application for a Watershed Density Averaging Certificate, on a form supplied by the Department of
Water Resources, is submitted according to the established deadlines and procedures.
2. The two lots are within the same water supply watershed, irrespective of jurisdictional boundaries;
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 399
3. If one of the lots is located in the Watershed Critical Area, that lot shall not be developed beyond the
applicable density limit listed in Table 12-6 or Table 12-7;
4. The overall density for both lots meets applicable density requirements of Table 12-6 or Table 12-7
and both lots meet applicable stormwater control requirements;
Commentary: The density averaging formulas would be such that the sum of the maximum by
the watershed regulations book numbers of dwelling units (DU) on the giving property and on the
receiving property, divided by the sum of their acreages (Ac), would be equal to the sum of the
reallocated numbers of dwelling units on the giving property and on the receiving property, divided
by the sum of their acreages. The BUA formula would substitute square footages of BUA for
numbers of dwelling units. To wit, maximum by the book [DU Property A + DU Property B]/[Ac
Property A + Ac Property B] = reallocated [DU Property A + DU Property B]/[Ac Property A + Ac
Property B] and maximum by the book [BUA Property A + BUA Property B]/[Ac Property A + Ac
Property B] = reallocated [BUA Property A + BUA Property B]/[Ac Property A + Ac Property B].
5. Built-upon areas are designed and located such that the Technical Review Committee finds that the
design of each site is such that all of the following are achieved:
a. Minimize stormwater runoff impact to the receiving waters;
b. Minimize concentrated stormwater flow;
c. Maximize the use of sheet flow through vegetated areas;
d. Maximize the flow length through vegetated areas; and
e. Average and adjust any undisturbed areas, as required in 30-12-4.2(B), Land Disturbance, to
reflect the density averaging.
6. The built-upon areas on both lots are located in upland areas and away from surface waters and
drainageways;
7. Both lots comply with the high density stream buffers;
8. The portions of the lots that are not being developed will remain in a vegetated or natural state, be
placed in Density Averaging Easements (DAE) in accordance with Subsection 10) below, and be
managed through one of the following means:
a. Conveyance to an owners' association as common elements,
b. Conveyance to a local government as a park, dedicated drainageway and open space or greenway;
or
c. Placement under a permanent conservation or farmland preservation easement.
9. Metes and bounds descriptions of the areas to remain vegetated and limits on use shall be recorded as
follows:
a. On a Density Averaging Plat;
b. If located within Common Elements, in the propertys declaration of covenants, conditions, and
restrictions;
c. If not located within Common Elements, in the individual deeds for each of the lots; and
d. With language making them irrevocable unless amended under the no net decrease provisions of
this ordinance.
10. Density Averaging Easements (DAE) shall be platted over those areas that are not to be developed,
which shall remain in a vegetated or natural state. Within such easements principal and accessory
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 400
buildings and structures are not permitted and the natural ground cover and the natural tree canopy
must be preserved, with the following exceptions:
a. Utilities and associated erosion control structures may be constructed and maintained;
b. Normal maintenance by mechanical means is allowed for the removal of dead, diseased, deformed,
poisonous, or noxious vegetation and pests harmful to health;
c. Mechanical mowing of utilities areas is allowed to control growth;
d. The removal of dead trees and logs is permitted, provided the stumps remain;
e. The removal of briars and vines is permitted, provided the underbrush remains in its natural state;
f. The removal of hazardous trees (as determined by the Water Resources Director on a case-bycase
basis) is permitted, provided that the stump remains and each tree removed is replaced with
a newly planted tree at a 1:1 ratio; and
g. The Technical Review Committee may grant a Type 2 Modification (see 30-4-11) for changes to
existing Density Averaging Easements.

Table Notes:
{1} If, compared to the sidewalk installation requirements effective through December 31, 2002, the sidewalk installation requirements contained
in Ordinance Number 02-239, effective January 1, 2003, increase the amount of sidewalk built-upon area, thereby exceeding the maximum builtupon
area allowable under the High-Density Option or necessitating additional stormwater control, treatment, or mitigation measures, the
Technical Review Committee may approve reductions to required street pavement widths, sidewalk widths, driveway widths, or off-street parking
area, so as to result in the same built-upon area as under the previous sidewalk installation requirements.
{2} In a subdivision, the BUA maximum applies to the subdivision as a whole, including streets, lots, etc. The maximum BUA allowed by this
column (assuming engineered stormwater controls are large enough) shall be allocated among streets, lots, etc. In single-family detached
development, the allocation to each house lot shall be uniform. In other development, the allocation may vary among lots. In all cases, the final plat
shall clearly state each lots allocation and restrictive covenants shall call attention to these allocations. On new or extended thoroughfare streets,
allocate enough BUA to cover 5 foot sidewalks on both sides; and on all other new or extended streets allocate enough to cover a 5 foot sidewalk
on one side.
{3} Alternatively, if total area minus area in street right-of-way, divided by number of house lots, equals 20,000 square feet or more, that is Low

30-12-3.12 Stormwater Quality Controls
A. Applicability
Where stormwater control is required by this Article, runoff from the following shall be controlled, and
engineered stormwater controls and other best management practices (BMPs) shall be sized accordingly.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 402
1. Newly built-upon areas and other new development on a site;
2. To the extent practicable, existing development on the site (consult with the Water Resources Director
for a determination); and
3. Any other on-site runoff that flows into the structure or BMP.
B. Roadway and Driveway Connections
Driveway and roadway connections shall be treated to the maximum extent possible. Such connections will
be evaluated on a site-by-site basis.
C. Methods of Stormwater Quality Control
1. Developments using the high-density option shall use engineered stormwater controls, which may
consist of wet detention ponds or alternative stormwater management systems consisting of other
treatment options, or a combination of options approved by the Director of the Division of Water
Quality in accordance with 15A NCAC 2B.0104(g), and 15A NCAC 2H.1008(a). The design criteria for
approval shall include control and treatment of the runoff from the first one inch of rain and a
minimum of 85% average annual removal for Total Suspended Solids (TSS), as well as discharge the
storage volume at a rate equal to or less than the predevelopment discharge rate for the one-year, 24-
hour storm. Runoff volume drawdown time shall be a minimum of 48 hours but not more than 120
hours.
2. Developments using the low-density option, if they are required to have stormwater control, shall use
either a method allowed under the high-density option or, as applicable, a method prescribed in 30-12-
4 or 30-12-5. For low density development in Other Watershed Districts the use of vegetated
conveyances shall be used to the maximum extent practicable.
3. New development that drains in whole or part to class NSW waters or waters assigned a Total
Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) by North Carolina DWQ shall design and implement best stormwater
management practices, up to and including the installation of engineered stormwater controls, that
reduce nutrient loading, or other pollutant of concern, while still meeting other requirements of this
ordinance. The Water Resources Director shall have final approval of any proposed structural best
management practice (BMP) required to meet state mandated nutrient loading or other pollutant of
concern reduction measures in order to facilitate treatment of the nutrient or pollutant of concern to
the maximum extent practicable.
D. Water Quality Control Exemptions
1. Development in Other Watershed Districts that cumulatively disturbs less than one acre and is not part
of a Larger Common Plan of Development, Redevelopment or Sale is exempt from the stormwater
quality control provisions of this section. Development that cumulatively disturbs less than one acre is
not exempt if such activities are part of a Larger Common Plan of Development, Redevelopment or
Sale, even though multiple, separate or distinct activities take place at different times on different
schedules.
2. Development that meets all of the following requirements is exempt from the stormwater quality
control provisions of this section:
a. The division of a tract in single ownership;
b. The tract area is not greater than 2 acres;
c. The division does not result in more than 3 lots;
d. No street right-of-way dedication is involved;
e. The resultant lots are equal to or exceed the standards of this ordinance; and
f. The development does not cumulatively disturb one acre or more.

30-12-4 Watershed Critical Areas (WCA)
30-12-4.1 General Provisions
A. Watershed Critical Area
The Watershed Critical Area is a district covering the portion of the watershed adjacent to a designated
existing or proposed water supply intake or reservoir where risk associated with pollution is greater than
from the remaining portions of the watershed. The WCA boundary shall not be less than one-half mile
from the normal pool elevation and draining to existing or proposed designated reservoirs.
B. Divisions Within the Watershed Critical Area
The WCA consists of 4 divisions as follows:
1. Tier 1
a. Tier 1 consists of those lands within 200 feet of the existing or proposed normal pool elevation and
those lands within one-half mile (High Point Lake, Oak Hollow Lake, Lake Brandt) or one mile
(Lake Townsend) upstream of water intake structure(s).
b. Tier 1 areas are intended for public purpose and should remain undisturbed.
2. Tier 2
a. Tier 2 consists of those lands lying within an area bounded by Tier 1 and a line parallel to and 750
feet from the normal pool elevation.
b. Tier 2 areas are intended primarily for public purpose.
3. Tier 3
Tier 3 consists of those lands lying within an area bounded on its inner edge by Tier 2 and on its outer
edge by a line parallel to and 3,000 feet from the normal pool elevation, or by the WCA boundary,
whichever comes first.
4. Tier 4
Tier 4 consists of those lands lying in the area between the outer boundary of Tier 3 and the WCA
boundary.
30-12-4.2 Land Disturbance Minimization
1. Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan
See 30-12-6.1 to determine when a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan is required.
2. Street Standards
Refer to Article VI for the minimum street standards. To the extent practicable, the construction of
new roads in the WCA should be avoided.
B. Land Disturbance
1. No land-disturbing activity is allowed within channel drainageways carrying 17 cubic feet per second or
more based upon the 100-year storm event, 15% slopes adjacent to drainageways, water quality
conservation easements, or undisturbed easements (UDE), except for road crossings, greenway, and
trail crossings, utilities, watershed devices, and soil erosion and sedimentation control devices
associated with road crossing and utility construction.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 404
2. Cut or fill activities resulting in slopes of 33% or more are not allowed, except to meet minimum safety
standards for roadways and trails or minimum building code or health code requirements.
3. The transfer of stormwater from a drainage area of 5 acres or greater by piping or channeling between
sub-basins within the WCA is not permitted unless approved by the Technical Review Committee. The
piping or channeling of stormwater from a WCA to a GWA or to a non-watershed basin is allowed.
4. A portion of the site shall remain in an undisturbed state in accordance with the following percentages:
Tier
Undisturbed
Limits
Tier 1 90%
Tier 2 90%
Tier 3 20%
Tier 4 15%
a. At least 25% of the undisturbed areas are to include land that is wooded or reforested in
accordance with the following:
i. Reforestation shall include a minimum of one tree per 200 square feet of surface area and
shall be made up of a mixture of deciduous hardwood and evergreen trees that are a minimum
of 4 feet tall at planting and approved by the Water Resources Director.
ii. The trunk of any required tree shall be no closer than 10 feet to any other tree.
b. All undisturbed areas are to be dedicated as undisturbed easements (UDE) in accordance with 30-
12-4.2(C)1)c).
c. When undisturbed areas are located in subdivisions with more than 2 lots, the undisturbed area

B. Definitions, Explanations, and Standards
1. Minimal Clustering
Means: in SF that there is 15% or more open space; in MF & NR that buildings and parking are
concentrated away from streams and steep slopes.
2. Moderate Clustering
Means: in SF that there is 25% or more open space; in MF that the Minimal Clustering criteria are met
and that at least half of the units are in buildings of 2 stories or more; in NR that Minimal Clustering
criteria are met and that parking uses 17-foot space depth and 24 foot aisles, or 8.5 foot space width.

ft. larger than the minimum allowed; in MF that at least 75% of the units are in buildings of 2 stories
or more, that the number of parking spaces is no more than 5% higher than the ordinance minimum,
and that there is no BUA that could be marked to form additional parking spaces; in NR that the
Moderate Clustering Criteria are met, as are the same parking requirements as in MF.
4. Exceptional Clustering
Means: in SF that there is 45% or more open space or that the average lot size is no more than 1,000
sq. ft. larger than the minimum allowed; in MF that the Major Clustering criteria are met and that all
units are in buildings of 2 stories or more and some are in buildings of 3 stories or more; in NR that
the Major Clustering criteria are met and that at least 20% of the parking spaces are inside buildings
of 2 stories or more.
5. Built-upon Area
If, compared to the sidewalk installation requirements effective through December 31, 2002, the
sidewalk installation requirements contained in Ordinance Number 02-239, effective January 1, 2003,
increase the amount of sidewalk built-upon area, thereby reducing the number of built-upon area
points earned, the Technical Review Committee may approve reductions to required street pavement
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 411
widths, sidewalk widths, driveway widths, or off-street parking area, so as to result in the same builtupon
area as under the previous sidewalk installation requirements.
6. Proximity to Floodway
If land is dedicated to the city as drainageway and open space, measure from the downhill edge of the
land not dedicated. If a street crossing that dedication is required by the city, ignore it in measuring.
7. Drainage
a. Protected Drainageway means drainage is channeled by pervious devices such as sod waterways,
berms, channels, or swales which have been constructed to resist soil erosion by either vegetating,
netting, rip-rapping, or a combination of those, and which allows infiltration of water into the soil.
b. Dispersed Drainage means spread out, as opposed to collecting the runoff in channels, so as to
effect increased sheet flow and overland flow.
c. Improved Drainageway means channeled by impervious surfaces such as curb and gutter or
concrete (gunnite, bituminous, etc.) channels.
d. Enhanced Drainageway means carried by existing natural drainageways which have been
enhanced to resist soil erosion, including stream bank degradation.
8. Average Slope
Means the maximum inclination of the land surface from the horizontal as measured in percentage
slope.
9. Land is Subject to Grading or Filling
Means if it is in street R/W, in a lot or common elements but not covered by a water quality
conservation easement, or in an area that will be disturbed before being dedicated to the public.
10. Sewage Disposal
No points will be allowed for on-site septic tank systems or private sewage treatment systems.
11. Wooded Area
Thickly Planted in Tree Stands means that trees (but not shrubs) are planted at a Type A number and
size planting rate. [Sample Calculation: if 30% remains wooded, 30 divided by 3=10 points; and if
another 18% is thickly planted in tree stands, 18 ÷ by 6=3 points; total score is 13 points.]
12. Grading
Other measures are measures not covered above but which are deemed effective by, and assigned up
to 10 total points by, the Technical Review Committee.
30-12-6 Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control
30-12-6.1 General Requirements
A. Plan and Permit Required
No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity without a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan
and a grading permit approved by the city, if the land-disturbing activity:
1. Uncovers more than one acre (lands under one ownership or diverse ownership being developed as a
unit shall be aggregated);
2. Will take place on highly erodible soils with a k factor greater than 0.36 in a Watershed Critical Area;
3. Includes a pond or retention structure in a Watershed Critical Area; or
4. Will take place in Tier 1 or Tier 2 of a Watershed Critical Area.
B. Protection of Property
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 412
Persons conducting land-disturbing activity shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and
private property from damage caused by such activity. This includes installing measures to maintain
sediment on site for all activities even if below the formal permitting threshold.
C. More Restrictive Rules Shall Apply
Whenever conflicts exist between federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, or rules, the more restrictive
provision shall apply.
30-12-6.2 Basic Control Objectives
A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan may be disapproved pursuant to 30-12-6.12(H) if the plan fails to
address the following control objectives:
A. Identify Critical Areas
On-site areas which are subject to severe erosion, and off-site areas which are especially vulnerable to
damage from erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special attention;
B. Limit Time of Exposure
All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time;
C. Limit Exposed Areas
All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed
at any one time;
D. Control Surface Water
Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and
sediment loss during the period of exposure;
E. Control Sedimentation
All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted so as to prevent off-site sedimentation damage;
and
F. Manage Stormwater Runoff
When the increase in the velocity of stormwater runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity is sufficient
to cause accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans are to include measures to control the
velocity at the point of discharge so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and increased
sedimentation of the stream.
30-12-6.3 Mandatory Standards for Land-disturbing Activity
No land-disturbing activity that is subject to control under this section may be undertaken except in
accordance with the following mandatory standards:
A. Buffer Zone
No land-disturbing activity during periods of construction or improvement to land shall be permitted in
proximity to a lake or natural watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided along the margin of the
watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible sedimentation within the 25% of the buffer zone nearest
the land-disturbing activity. Unless otherwise expressly stated the width of a buffer zone is measured from
the edge of the water to the nearest edge of the disturbed area, with the 25% of the strip nearer the landdisturbing
activity containing natural or artificial means of confining visible sedimentation.
B. Graded Slopes and Fills
The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no steeper than 2:1 slope if they are to be stabilized with
vegetative cover. Slopes or fills steeper than 2:1 slope must be protected by structures. In any event,
slopes left exposed shall, within 15 days of completion of any phase of grading, be planted or otherwise
provided with ground cover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion.
C. Ground Cover
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 413
Whenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on a tract comprising more than one acre, if more than
one acre is uncovered, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install such sedimentation
and erosion control devices and practices as are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the landdisturbing
activity within the boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of said
tract; and he shall plant or otherwise provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after
completion of construction or development. Except as provided in 30-12-6.4(B)5), provisions for a ground
cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be accomplished within 15 business days or 30 calendar days
following completion, whichever period is shorter.
D. Prior Plan
Approval No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity on a tract if more than one acre is to be
uncovered unless, 30 or more days prior to initiating the activity, a soil erosion and sedimentation control
plan for such activity has been filed, and such plan has been approved by the city.
30-12-6.4 Design and Performance Standards
A. Design for 10-Year Storm
Except as provided in 30-12-6.4(B)2), soil erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and
devices shall be so planned, designed, and constructed as to provide protection from the calculated
maximum peak rate of runoff from the 10-year storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the
procedures in the USDA, Soil Conservation Services National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation
Practices or other acceptable calculation procedures.
B. High Quality Water Zones
In High Quality Water (HQW) zones the following design standards shall apply:
1. Uncovered areas in HQW zones shall be limited at any time to a maximum total area within the
boundaries of the tract of 20 acres. Only the portion of the land-disturbing activity within a HQW zone
shall be governed by this subsection. Larger areas may be uncovered within the boundaries of the
tract with the written approval of the Director (DENR).
2. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices within HQW zones shall be so
planned, designed, and constructed to provide protection from the runoff of the 25-year storm which
produces the maximum peak rate of runoff as calculated according to procedures in the USDA, Soil
Conservation Services National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices or according to
procedures adopted by any other agency of this state or the United States or any generally recognized
organization or association.
3. Sediment basins within HQW zones shall be designed and constructed such that the basin will have a
settling efficiency of at least 70% for the 40 micron (0.04 mm) size soil particle transported into the
basin by the runoff of that 2-year storm which produces the maximum peak rate of runoff as
calculated according to procedures in the USDA, Soil Conservation Services National Engineering Field
Manual for Conservation Practices or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of this
state or the United States or any generally recognized organization or association.
4. Newly constructed open channels in HQW zones shall be designed and constructed with side slopes no
steeper than 2 horizontal to one vertical if a vegetative cover is used for stabilization unless soil
conditions permit a steeper slope or where the slopes are stabilized by using mechanical devices,
structural devices, or other acceptable ditch liners. In any event, the angle for side slopes shall be
sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion.
5. Ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be provided for any portion of a land-disturbing
activity in a HQW zone within 15 working days or 30 calendar days following completion of
construction or development, whichever period is shorter.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 414
30-12-6.5 Stormwater Outlet Protection
A. Intent
Stream banks and channels downstream from any land-disturbing activity shall be protected from
increased degradation by accelerated erosion caused by increased velocity of runoff from the landdisturbing
activity.
B. Performance Standard
Persons shall conduct land-disturbing activity so that the post-construction velocity of the 10-year storm
runoff in the receiving watercourse to the discharge point does not exceed the greater of:
1. The velocity established by 30-12-6.8; or
2. The velocity of 10-year runoff in the receiving watercourse prior to development.
3. If conditions (1) or (2) above cannot be met, then the receiving watercourse to and including the
discharge point shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity anywhere the
velocity exceeds the prior to development velocity by 10%.
C. Acceptable Management Measures
Measures applied alone or in combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are no
objectionable secondary consequences. The city recognizes that the management of stormwater runoff to
minimize or control downstream channel and bank erosion is a developing technology. Innovative
techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce
successful results. Some alternatives are to:
1. Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote infiltration to
compensate for increased runoff from areas rendered impervious;
2. Avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales and
waterways in lieu of closed drains and high velocity paved sections;
3. Provide energy dissipators at outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities to the point of
discharge. These may range from simple riprapped sections to complex structures; or
4. Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving cross sections and/or providing
erosion-resistant lining.
D. Exceptions
Subsections (B) and (C) above shall not apply where it can be demonstrated that stormwater discharge
velocities will not create an erosion problem in the receiving watercourse.
30-12-6.6 Borrow and Waste Areas
When the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is also the person conducting the borrow or waste
disposal activity, areas from which borrow is obtained and which are not regulated by the provisions of the
Mining Act of 1971, and waste areas for surplus materials other than landfills regulated by the Departments
Division of Solid Waste Management, shall be considered as part of the land-disturbing activity where the
borrow material is being used or from which the waste material originated. When the person conducting landdisturbing
activity is not the person obtaining the borrow and/or disposing of the waste, these areas shall be
considered a separate land-disturbing activity.
30-12-6.7 Access and Haul Roads
Temporary access and haul roads, other than public roads, constructed or used in connection with any landdisturbing
activity shall be considered a part of such activity.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 415
30-12-6.8 Operations in Lakes or Natural Watercourses
Land-disturbing activity in connection with construction in, on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse
shall be planned and conducted to minimize the extent and duration of disturbance of the stream channel. The
relocation of a stream, where relocation is an essential part of the proposed activity, shall be planned and
executed so as to minimize changes in the stream flow characteristics, except when justification for significant
alteration to flow characteristic is provided. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers shall be notified by the
developer of any planned operation in lakes or natural watercourses for possible issuance of Section 404 or
other permits.

consent is refused, the Water Resources Director may seek issuance or an administrative search
warrant.
D. Assessments
1. Property owners of single-family homes, townhouses and condominium properties can request that
City Council approve a resolution that allows stormwater improvement costs to be assessed against the
property as a lien.
2. The City Council is authorized to determine which stormwater improvements inside the city will be
provided and the type of solution, either piping or non-piping, for the improvement. The City Council
likewise has the authority to determine the amount of construction cost to be borne by the abutting
property owners and the amount to be borne by the city.
3. The assessment formula for stormwater improvements using a piping solution must be set at a rate
that recovers 100% of the construction cost, including engineering, labor and materials of a 15-inch
stormwater pipe or a rate not to exceed 50% of the total project cost, whichever is less. The
assessment formula for stormwater improvements using a non-piping solution must be set at a rate of
10% of the cost, including engineering, labor and materials. The assessment rate must be reviewed
for any necessary adjustments once a year in coordination with the annual budget process.
4. Upon receiving notice of completion of a stormwater management project, City Council must confirm
all assessment obligations in the project and must call for advertisement of assessment obligations in a
local newspaper published at least weekly and that is generally available to citizens. Such
advertisement must run within 45 days following the date of confirmation and must inform that all
listed assessment obligations may be fully satisfied, without interest, if payment-in-full of the total
principal balance is received by the tax collector within 90 days following the date of confirmation.
5. Assessment accounts not paid in full within 90 days following the confirmation date must be scheduled
for payment in substantially equal installments, plus interest on the whole unpaid principal balance.
Such interest must be computed from the date of confirmation at a rate fixed in the assessment
resolution, with the rate not exceeding the maximum allowed by law. The first installment is due and
payable no later than 365 days following confirmation, with subsequent installments being due and
payable on the regular and sequential cycle of the installment frequency (monthly, quarterly, semiCity
of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 420
annually or annually) elected by the obligee and with the final installment being due and payable by
not later than one 120 months after the confirmation date.
6. If the obligee expresses no preference regarding payment frequency, the assessment obligation will be
scheduled for payment in 10 annual installments. Upon approval of the tax collector, the frequency of
payment for existing assessment accounts may be changed for the economic and budgetary
convenience of the obligee, with the first such change being granted without charge and with
subsequent changes being granted with a transaction fee of $35.00.
7. At any time after the first 90 days in the life of an assessment account, the full principal balance may
be paid in full with all accrued interest and without early payoff penalty.

30-12-7.2 Commercial and Residential
A. New Development
1. Drainage
a. It is the duty of all property owners, in order to abate and prevent nuisances resulting from
improper drainage, to provide at their own expense a proper and adequate drainage system of
their respective premises, such drainage system to conform to the design established by the city.
b. Rainwater leaders may not extend beyond the building or property line, but rather must be built in
chases or on the inside of the wall, and may not empty on any street or sidewalk.
c. No person may construct or install any ditch, pipe or other device for the diversion or transmission
of storm drainage that will in any way affect the operation or maintenance of city street, water,
sanitary sewer or storm sewer facilities without a permit issued by the Water Resources Director
upon a finding that such city facilities will not be adversely affected by such construction or
installation.
d. Maintenance
In accordance with city policy the developer is responsible for establishing proper connections with
existing storm sewer lines and bears ultimate responsibility for the correction of any problems
associated with that connection. (See Roadway and Utility Design Manual)
2. Additional Requirements
a. Parking Lot Construction and Paving
No new parking lot, loading dock construction, or the construction of similar structures or the
grading/or paving of existing parking lots, loading docks, or similar structures may be undertaken
until the developer obtains a permit from the city. The site must be inspected before, during and
after construction. Any violation of the permit will result in permit revocation and cessation of
construction until the violations are corrected.
b. Stormwater Management
The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater improvements to meet the requirements
of 30-12-7.2(B) must comply with the Stormwater Management Manual the specifications and
requirements of which are hereby adopted and made a part of this chapter as if set out in full.
c. Development Policy Manual
RESERVED
d. Responsibility of Property Owner
It is the responsibility of the property owner to correct drainage controls on individual properties
that do not function properly or are not constructed according to their design.
e. New Storm Drainage Design and Construction
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 421
All new storm sewer infrastructure must be constructed according to the Storm Drainage
Design Manual.
B. Stormwater Management Control Requirements
1. Purpose
These stormwater management control requirements are intended to protect, maintain, and enhance
the public health, safety, and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures
to control the adverse effects of increased stormwater runoff associated with new development or
redevelopment within the city. Additionally, this section requires development that drains in whole or in
part to waters with special designation such as NSW or impaired waters assigned a Total Maximum
Daily Load (TMDL) by North Carolina DWQ, to be designed using best management practices, up to
and including the installation of engineered stormwater controls, that reduce nutrients or other
pollutants of concern, to the maximum extent practicable, while still meeting other requirements of
this section. Proper management of stormwater runoff, including the provision of stream buffers, will
minimize damage to public and private property, promote a functional storm drainage system, reduce
local flooding and drainage problems, and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-developed
stormwater runoff characteristics of the developed site.
2. Applicability
The stormwater management control requirements of this subsection (30-12-7.2(B)) apply to the
following type of developments.
a. All sites containing new development and/or redevelopment including grading, paving, gravel
placement, and construction of buildings and other structures within the corporate limits and the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city.
b. The construction and installation of new public improvements by federal, state or local government
agencies shall comply with the provisions of this section to the extent practicable unless the
federal, state or local government agency has a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) stormwater permit that applies to the project site.
3. Participation in a Regional Stormwater Control Program
See 30-12-3.5
4. Stormwater Management Plan
See 30-4-15.6(B)
5. Stormwater Quantity and Quality Improvements
See 30-12-3.7
6. Stream Protection Requirements
See 30-12-3.9
7. Stormwater Management Requirements
a. Minimum stormwater management requirements for all new development and redevelopment must
consist of runoff control measures necessary to control runoff to a level that will not cause
increased off-site quantity problems as specified in 30-12-7.2(B)7)b) and 30-12-7.2(B)7)c) below.
b. Quantity Control Requirements
i. The engineer must provide a certification that the subject development or redevelopment
would not cause increased off-site flooding, drainage, or erosion problems. Determination of
impacts must be based on hydrologic and hydraulic engineering studies extending downstream
to a point where the proposed site development or redevelopment represents less than 10% of
the total drainage area or watershed. The studies must be based on an analysis of both 2- and
10-year storm events. (see Stormwater Management Manual).
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 422
ii. If it is determined that the development of the subject site does contribute to flooding,
drainage or soil erosion problems at any location between the proposed development site and
the 10% downstream point then stormwater quantity control improvements must be
implemented. The stormwater quantity control improvements must limit the 2-year and 10-
year post-development peak discharge rates to pre-development peak discharge rates, to
minimize increased flooding, drainage, and erosion problems. These improvements may
consist of nonstructural approaches such as natural swales, depressions in the land and other
natural approaches, or structural approaches such as detention structures (wet and dry
basins), extended detention facilities and alternative best management practices with
provisions for stormwater quantity control. A combination of nonstructural and structural
approaches is encouraged.
iii. For stormwater management improvements that are proposed to be implemented to meet the
quantity control requirements of this section, a hydrologic-hydraulic analysis of the site
drainage system in the pre-development condition and the post-development condition must
be performed. The analysis should be included with the stormwater management plan and
should demonstrate that the quantity control requirements stated in 30-12-7.2(B)7)b) will be
achieved by the proposed improvements. These improvements are subject to review and
approval by the Water Resources Director.
c. Developments that meet the requirement for being identified as an integrated multiple use
developments, planned unit developments, phased developments or group developments can meet
the requirements of 30-12-7.2(B)6) at the point the discharge leaves the overall property.
8. Master Plan Requirements
It is the intent of the city to produce stormwater quantity and quality management master plans to
guide the design and development of the drainage system for all of the major sub-watersheds and
watersheds in the city. Where such master plans are available and approved by the City Council, site
development projects are to conform to the stormwater management guidance and standards
available in said master plans.
9. Additional Requirements
If site characteristics indicate that complying with the minimum stormwater management requirements
of this section will not provide adequate designs or protection for local residents, and downstream
property, it shall be the site designers responsibility to exceed the minimum requirements as
necessary.
10. Exempt Activities
The following activities are exempt from the requirements of 30-12-7.2(B)7). However, any restrictions
upon building location, drainageways, pavement, or other built-upon area, or any other matter
appearing on any previously approved development plan covering the subject property, shall be
complied with unless and until replaced by an approved revised plan.
a. Individual single-family housing on an individual lot.
b. Replacement of existing built-upon area with like or lesser amount of new built-upon at the same
location, or at a different location on the same zone lot if the Water Resources Director has
determined that equal or improved stormwater management will result.
c. Placement of small accessory buildings or structures or small amounts of additional built-upon area
provided that the total additional built-upon area is no greater than 400 square feet.
d. Activities exempt from permit requirements of Section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, as
specified in 40 CFR 232 are exempt from watershed requirements of this ordinance. Stream buffer
requirements for ongoing farming and forestry activities will be implemented and enforced by the
Division of Water Quality.

were originally constructed by the city.
30-12-8 Open Space
30-12-8.1 Drainageway Open Space for Subdivisions
A. General
1. All watercourses that lie within the city or within or adjacent to developments provided with city water
or sewer service pursuant to the water and sewer service agreement (WSSA) that will carry a flow of 5
cubic feet per second or more during a 10-year storm, as calculated in accordance with the citys
Storm Drainage Design Manual, must provide drainageway treatment in one or more of the 3
ways listed in 30-12-8.1(B), 30-12-8.1(C) and 30-12-8.1(D), below. Except where 30-12-8.1(A)2)
leaves the determination of the drainageway treatment to the developer, the Technical Review
Committee is authorized to determine the treatment methods to be used, based upon the pipe size
necessary to handle drainage and adopted Drainageway and Open Space Plan or Maps and the
following factors:
a. the type of development;
b. the drainageway treatment employed by nearby developments;
c. the probability of creating a lengthy greenway or drainageway and open space;
d. the probability of creating future maintenance problems;
e. the probability of erosion or flooding problems; and
f. the adopted Drainageway and Open Space Plan or Map.
2. If the area is not identified on the Drainageway and Open Space Plan or Map and would require less
than a 66-inch diameter pipe in a 100-year storm event, the developer is authorized to determine the
drainageway treatments, in a manner consistent with the regulations of this subsection.
B. Enclosed Subsurface Drains
1. Storm drainage lines, connections, and facilities must be designed and constructed in accordance with
the citys Storm Drainage Design Manual. Enclosed systems must be based on the 10-year storm
event.
2. A utility easement designed to accommodate storm drainage must be dedicated on a Final Plat when
determined necessary by the city. The required utility easement must be centered on the enclosure
when practical, but in no case may the outside wall of the enclosure be located less than 5 feet from
the edge of the easement. The easement must be of a width determined necessary for maintenance
purposes by the city based upon enclosure depth, topography, and location of existing and proposed
improvements, but in no case less than 15 feet in width.
3. Storm drainage easements may be used for future installation of other underground utilities.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 434
Figure 12-5, Drainageway and Open Space Dedication
C. Open Channels in Dedicated Drainageway and Open Space Areas
1. Open channel drainageways must be based on the 100-year storm event.
2. Drainageway and open space must be dedicated by a recorded plat and must be labeled Dedicated to
the City of Greensboro and the public for Drainageway and Open Space purposes. If a portion of the
drainageway and open space lies within a proposed thoroughfare shown on the Thoroughfare Plan , it
must be labeled Dedicated to the City of Greensboro and the public for Drainageway and Open Space
and Thoroughfare purposes.
3. The dedicated drainageway and open space area along any stream that would require a 66-inch or
larger diameter pipe must include the special flood hazard area. If there is no established flood hazard
area identified on the FIRM or in the FIS report, the base flood elevation and one percent annual
chance flood boundary are to be determined in accordance with 30-12-2.3(F)3). The area to be
dedicated may be reduced in width by filling provided that a minimum average width of 200 feet is
maintained, a minimum width of 100 feet is maintained at the narrowest point, no fill is placed within a
designated floodway, and no slope greater than 3:1 is created. The minimum average width in other
locations must be 60 feet.
Commentary: Other regulations of this ordinance and/or federal wetlands regulations prohibit or
restrict fill placement in certain locations.
4. In cases of severe topography or other obstacles, additional width may be required to assure
reasonable ease of maintenance.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 435
5. Dedicated drainageway and open space area must abut public street right-of-way on at least 30% of
its perimeter, except when the Technical Review Committee determines that adequate access is
otherwise provided. The minimum length of street frontage at each location where drainageway and
open space abuts public street right-of-way must be at least 60 feet. The maximum distance between
such locations, measured by straight lines on each side of the drainageway, may not exceed 1,000
feet.
6. The centerline of the drainage channel that would require a 66-inch or larger diameter pipe must be
located a minimum of 50 feet from all street and property lines, provided that the dimensions of the
drainageway and open space area conform to all other requirements of this section. Along smaller
drainageways, the minimum distance from the centerline is 20 feet.
7. Dedicated drainageway and open space may be used for drainage, open space, greenways, bikeways,
trails, and other similar recreation activities, including park- and trail- related improvements in
accordance with applicable regulations.
8. Dedicated drainageway and open space may be used for utility lines provided the lines are shown on
approved construction and utility plans before final plat recordation or approved by the Parks and
Recreation Department after final plat recordation.
9. Drainageway and open space must be left in its natural condition or graded to a cross-section
approved by the city and stabilized with permanent vegetative cover that will allow economical and
efficient maintenance. This provision is not intended to prevent use of dedicated drainageway and
open space areas for drainage, open space, greenways, bikeways, trails, and other similar recreational
improvements.
10. Single-family lots abutting property 60 feet or more in width dedicated to the city and the public as
drainageway and open space may be reduced in size in accordance with the provisions in 30-7-3.2(L).
Commentary: See 30-4-17.8 for procedures governing dedication of open space and
easements.
D. Open Channels in Drainageway Maintenance and Utility Easements
1. Open channels in drainageway maintenance and utility easements may not be utilized in any
subdivision intended for single-family detached dwellings unless the Technical Review Committee
determines that an open channel would not become a missing segment in a stormwater piping system
and that the open channel is sufficiently distant from all anticipated building locations.
2. The drainage maintenance and utility easement must include the special flood hazard area. If there is
no established flood hazard area identified on the FIRM or in the FIS report, the base flood elevation
and one percent annual chance flood boundary are to be determined in accordance with 30-12-2. The
easement may be reduced in width or shifted by modifying the topography if permitted under the flood
damage prevention regulations of 30-12-2 and the soil erosion and sedimentation provisions of 30-12-
6. In such cases, the approved typical required drainage channel section must include the necessary
channel to accommodate a one-hundred-year flood. The area outside of the required drainage channel
may be filled; but any resulting slope may be no steeper than 2:1, unless the slope is protected by
masonry paving, rip-rap, or other material that meets all city specifications.
3. The minimum width of a drainage maintenance and utility easement may not be less than specified
below if the edge of the easement as specified below and the edge of a required stream buffer are
close to coinciding, the Water Resources Director may authorize the easement line to be moved to
coincide with the stream buffer line.

Technical Review Committee approves other easement alignments because of topographic conditions.
5. In cases of severe topography or other obstacles, additional width may be required to assure
reasonable ease of maintenance.
6. If the Technical Review Committee determines that suitable access to the drainage maintenance and
utility easement is not provided, access must be guaranteed by a suitably located access easement not
less than 20 feet in width.
7. It is solely the owners responsibility to maintain all streams and all required stream buffers located
within the easement.
8. If the City Council determines that it is in the public interest to alter the typical required channel
section and/or profile of the stream to improve flow, the city may enter the property within the
indicated access or drainage maintenance and utility easement and carry out the necessary work
without liability for damage to the property or improvements located within the easement.
9. No buildings or structures, except for water-related improvements, may be placed or constructed
within the access or drainage maintenance and utility easement except as expressly allowed as
easement encroachments. Drives, parking areas, or other improvements may be constructed no closer
than 2 feet horizontally from the top of any back slope along any open watercourse.
10. The stream buffer requirements of 30-12-3.9 apply along all intermittent and perennial streams.

i. A minimum of 75% of the provided open space must be usable and not occupied by streets,
drives, parking areas, or structures other than recreational structures.
ii. All property owners in the planned unit development must have access to the open space by
means of a public street, a private street, a private drive, or an all-weather walkway in an
easement a minimum of 20 feet in width.
c. Up to 50% of the required open space for a planned unit development may be contained within a
public park with active recreational facilities or other public recreational opportunities available
such that the usable portion of said park is located within 1,320 feet of the planned unit
development, as measured along a system of public sidewalks and crosswalks.
i. The Technical Review Committee may grant a Type 2 Modification in accordance with 30-4-11
for off-site opportunities located within 1,600 feet when they find that equal or better
performance will result, with regard to nature and extent of either existing or proposed
sidewalk enhancements or other pedestrian amenities located along the route.
ii. If a portion of the route does not contain a sidewalk, the Technical Review Committee may
grant a Type 2 Modification in accordance with 30-4-11 when they find that equal or better
performance will result, with regard to the pedestrians ability to safely traverse the nonsidewalk
portion of the route.
d. When the Parks and Recreation Director determines that there is either the need for or an
opportunity to purchase property for park purposes or enhance existing city property for public
park or usable public open space purposes within 2 miles of the planned unit development, the
developer may provide a fee in lieu of providing up to 50% of the required open space. Fees
submitted in lieu of required open space must be in an amount equal to that of the average
market value for actual city property purchased within the past 3 years for generally comparable
property located within 5 miles of the planned unit development. Property values may be adjusted
based on generally accepted appraisal practices. All fees collected by the city pursuant to this
subsection must be deposited in an appropriate account and used only for the purchase of
property for park purposes, or enhancing the existing city property for park purposes. Use of
submitted funds must be coordinated with other park projects. If the use of the fee in lieu option is
determined to not be appropriate by the Parks and Recreation Director, this option is permitted
and the planned unit development must provide the required amount of open space through other
allowed means.

City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 440
Article 13. Subdivision Standards
30-13-1 Purpose
In addition to promoting the general purposes of this ordinance, the subdivision design and improvement
standards of this article (and the subdivision review and approval procedures of 30-4-17) are intended to help:
30-13-1.1 facilitate the creation of accurate and permanent public records of the separate interests
created and conveyed by the subdivision of land, and in turn, help to protect private property rights and
city property;
30-13-1.2 promote the timely and coordinated provision of streets, sidewalks, utilities and other
required facilities and improvements to serve new developments;
30-13-1.3 ensure that proposed lots are capable of being built upon in accordance with applicable city
standards; and
30-13-1.4 ensure subdivision designs and layouts that promote beneficial development of the
community.
30-13-1.5 Development Name
The name of a proposed subdivision or development may not duplicate or be so similar to the name of an
existing subdivision or development that it is reasonable to conclude that the name will cause confusion for
public safety and other parties. Proposed subdivisions or developments may have the same or similar name if
they are an extension of an existing subdivision or development with the same or similar name. The Planning
and Community Development Director has final authority to approve subdivision and development names.
30-13-1.6 Reasonable Relationship
All required improvements, easements, and rights-of-way (other than required reservations) must substantially
benefit the development and bear a reasonable relationship to the need for public facilities and improvements
attributable to the new development.
30-13-2 Streets
30-13-2.1 Traffic Movement and Pedestrian Circulation Principles
The street and pedestrian circulation layout in new subdivisions should be laid out and designed with due
regard for topography and drainage and to the extent practicable to:
A. create an integrated system of lots, streets, trails, and infrastructure that provides for efficient movement
of pedestrians, bicycles and automobiles within the subdivision and to and from adjacent development;
B. provide for the efficient movement of through traffic by providing an interconnected hierarchy of streets in
order to avoid isolation of residential areas and over-reliance on thoroughfares;
C. provide pedestrian routes to nearby pedestrian activity areas, as well as nearby shopping, public/civic,
employment and recreation uses; and
D. provide a street network that helps emergency services, public services, and visitors find their way to their
intended destinations.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 441
30-13-2.2 Dedication of Right-of-Way
Right-of-way for public streets must be dedicated to the city pursuant to NCGS 160A, Article 19, Part 2 and
other applicable state laws. When dedication cannot be required, the plat must plat show how the
development accommodates any future street right-of-way indicated on the adopted Thoroughfare Plan or
Collector Street Plan .
30-13-2.3 Conformance with Thoroughfare and Collector Street Plans
The location and design of streets must be in conformance with applicable thoroughfare and collector street
plans. Where conditions warrant, right-of-way widths and pavement widths in excess of the minimum street
standards may be required.
30-13-2.4 Street System Layout
A. Streets must be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of streets and dedicated rightsof-
way as established in the Comprehensive Plan, the Thoroughfare Plan and Collector Street Plan .
B. Streets must be properly related to special traffic generators, such as industries, business districts, schools,
religious assembly uses, and shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and
proposed land uses.
C. Local streets must be laid out to conform as much as possible to topography, to provide for the efficient
dispersal of internal traffic while discouraging high volumes of through traffic, and to permit efficient
drainage and accommodate utility systems.
D. The use of an interconnected street system must be used to broadly disperse internal traffic and provide
maximum reasonable alternatives for access to property. The street connectivity policy referenced in
30-13-2.5 applies.
E. The use of curvilinear streets is encouraged where conformance with existing topography would minimize
the volume of cut and fill.
F. Street designs such as loop streets or closes are preferred to the use of traditional cul-de-sac designs. Culde-
sacs are encouraged where topographic features, natural resources or configuration of property
boundaries prevent street connections. These alternatives help support the turning movements of
emergency and service vehicles.
G. Proposed streets must be extended (stubbed) to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided when
necessary to afford desirable and safe street access to adjoining properties. The Technical Review
Committee may waive the requirement for stub streets when topography, abutting development
conditions, natural resources or other physical conditions make street extensions impractical and when the
Technical Review Committee determines that an interconnected street network is unnecessary or
undesirable.
30-13-2.5 Street Connectivity
An interconnected street system is necessary in order to promote orderly and safe development. This is done
by ensuring that streets function in an interdependent manner, provide adequate access for emergency and
service vehicles, enhance access by ensuring connected transportation routes, and provide continuous and
comprehensible traffic routes. See the Connectivity Policy for additional information.
30-13-2.6 Temporary Turnarounds
A. A temporary turnaround must be provided at the end of any stub street over 150 feet length or serving
more than 4 lots. Temporary turnarounds must comply with the following:
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 442
1. the turnaround must be constructed in a temporary easement or within the public right-of-way;
2. the developer of the adjacent property making a road connection to the existing stub road is
responsible for the removal of the turnaround for the restoration of the area at the time that the road
connection is made, and any additional improvements required by the city; and
3. The turnaround must comply with all applicable temporary turnaround standards, including the Street
Design Standards Manual and the Roadway and Utility Design Standards.
4. Temporary turnarounds may not be used for parking and/or driveways.
B. Any plat containing a stub street must include the following notes:
1. "The street system shown on this plat includes one or more stub streets that are intended to be
connected to the adjacent property at such time that the property is developed. The interconnection of
neighborhoods with a street network ensures the efficient flow and dispersal of traffic and provides for
additional points of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles."
2. "The developer of the adjacent property making a road connection to the existing stub road is
responsible for the removal of the turnaround for the restoration of the area at the time that the road
connection is made, and any additional improvements required by the city."
3. In addition, a sign must be posted on the stub street right-of-way indicating that it is intended as a
"Future Street Extension."
30-13-2.7 Reserve Strips
Reserve strips adjoining street rights-of-way that prevent access to adjacent property are prohibited.
30-13-2.8 Street Classification

in accordance with the Type 2 Modification procedure when they determine that a flag lot is necessary to
allow reasonable use and benefit of the subject parcel or to alleviate situations that would otherwise cause
undue hardship. The modification request must include the proposed building footprint so that the
Technical Review Committee can establish the required building orientation, setback and planting yards
based on the lot configuration. Flag lots may be allowed only in the following instances:
1. when reasonably necessary to eliminate access onto thoroughfares;
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 448
2. when necessary to make reasonable use of parcels with severe topography or other physical
constraints;
3. when a flag lot would provide greater protection of natural resources areas (e.g., streams); or
4. when necessary to accommodate the function of hiding or concealing utility buildings/substation, or
radio, television of communication towers.
B. Approved flag lots are subject to the following requirements:
1. A flag lot may contain only one single-family dwelling, including any uninhabited accessory structures;
a utility substation; or radio, television, or communication towers (when permitted by zoning).

distance must be measured along the street, then along the flagpole, then in a straight line to the
building location.
6. Where public sewer is available occupied buildings on the flag lot must have a gravity service line, or
the sewer pump requirement must be noted on the plat.
7. Use of a single driveway to serve adjoining flag lots or to serve a flag lot and an adjoining conventional
lot is permitted and encouraged. In the latter case, the preferred location for the driveway is on the
flagpole portion of the flag lot, with the conventional lot granted an access easement over the flagpole.

Easements for sanitary sewer and water lines shall be exclusive to the city, unless otherwise determined
by the Water Resources Director. The locations and widths of such easements shall be reviewed and
approved by the Water Resources Director. Such easements shall be provided with a minimum width of 20
feet or 2 times the line depth (rounded up to the next multiple of 5 feet), whichever is greater. The
locations and widths of easements containing public storm sewer pipes shall be in accordance with the
Storm Drainage Design Manual.
B. Other Utility Easements
Utility easements with a maximum width of 30 feet must be provided to accommodate electric, telephone,
gas, and community antenna television services; conduits; or water and sewer lines. The location and
dimensional standards of such easements must be reviewed and approved by the city, with advice from
utility providers, before final plat approval.
C. No Buildings or Improvements
Utility easements must be kept free and clear of any buildings or other improvements that would interfere
with the proper maintenance or replacement of utilities. In addition, outside of but alongside water and
sanitary sewer easements and easements containing public storm sewer pipes, improvements that exert
loads into the easement at a depth determined by the lowest point of the applicable utility line within the
easement envelope and affected segment shall not be allowed. The city is not liable for damages to any
improvement located within the utility easement area. In addition, foundation design of structures must
account for the area of influence in case of future utility excavation in the easement.
30-13-4.5 Private Utilities
Maintenance of private utilities is the sole responsibility of the property owner or owners association, as
applicable. See 30-13-9 for regulations governing the establishment of property owners' associations.

Engineered stormwater controls shall be designed and installed in accordance with the requirements of 30-12-
3 (Water Supply Watershed Districts and Other Watershed Districts).
30-13-5.2 Maintenance Responsibilities
A. When permanent engineered stormwater controls serve more than 2 lots within a subdivision, an owners'
association must be assigned responsibility of ownership and maintenance.
B. When permanent engineered stormwater controls serve only 2 lots, they must be maintained by the
owners of the lots under a recorded maintenance agreement pursuant to 30-13-5.5.
C. Subdividers are responsible for installation of engineered stormwater controls and they are responsible for
maintenance of such facilities until the permanent engineered stormwater controls have:
1. been covered by an Engineers Certification of Stormwater Control Completion; (see 30-4-15.6(B)6));
2. been granted final approval by the Planning and Community Development Director;
3. been shown on a recorded final plat; and
4. been conveyed to the owners' association; after controlling interest is no longer an entity of the
subdivision.
D. Neither the posting of a performance guarantee for the completion of stormwater controls nor conveyance
of the land containing the controls structures relieves the subdivider of the responsibility for maintenance
described in 30-13-5.2(C).
E. After the permanent engineered stormwater controls have been conveyed to the owners association, the
owners association is responsible for maintaining the facilities as directed by the governmental office
having jurisdiction for watershed protection and, if the owners association is dissolved or ceases to exist,
then all the lot owners of record at the time of the required maintenance will be jointly and severally liable
for any and all costs attendant thereto.

When a subdivision contains permanent engineered stormwater controls that serve more than 2 lots within the
subdivision, each final plat in the subdivision must contain a prominent note with the full text of paragraph 30-
13-5.2(E) and the name of the owners' association.
(Amended by Ord. 10-161 on 12/1/10)
30-13-5.4 Plat Recordation
A. If a subdivision lot is dependent upon an engineered stormwater control to meet the requirements of 30-
12-3 (Water Supply Watershed Districts and Other Watershed Districts), that structures location and type
must be shown on the same plat as the lot or on a plat recorded previously.
1. If the runoff control structure has been completed, with full design volume available (this may require
the cleanout and disposal of sediment from the engineered stormwater control), when the plat is
recorded, it shall be labeled as existing and an Engineers Certification of Stormwater Control
Completion must be included on the plat (See 30-4-15.6(B)6)).
2. If the structure has not been completed, it must be labeled as proposed, a performance guarantee for
its completion within one year, with full design volume available, must be provided in accordance with
30-4-20, and a prominent asterisk must be placed on the lot accompanied by a note on the plat stating
that
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 452
a. no certificate of occupancy may be issued for any building on that lot until the engineered
stormwater controls have been completed, certified, and approved and
b. (the name of the person/developer) has posted a financial guarantee and bears responsibility for
its timely completion.
3. If the Water Resources Director determines that there is a potential risk that underground rock, buried
materials, springs, underground utility lines, or some other obstacle may make construction of the
structure unviable, the Water Resource Director is authorized to require that excavation for the
structure be successfully performed prior to acceptance of the performance guarantee.
(Amended by Ord. 10-161 on 12/1/10)
30-13-5.5 Engineered Stormwater Control Maintenance Agreements
A. The proposed engineered stormwater control maintenance agreement must be reviewed and approved by
the governmental office having jurisdiction for watershed protection and Planning and Community
Development Director prior to recordation.
B. The agreement must state which lot is responsible for maintenance and include provisions (including
easement to enter lot, if applicable) to allow the other lot to maintain the device, if that lot does not
perform the maintenance.
C. The agreement must provide that the property owner or owners association is responsible for
maintenance of the engineered stormwater control, as directed by the governmental office having
jurisdiction for watershed protection.
D. Specify whether and how the maintenance costs will be shared, in accordance with the following options:
1. the parties to the agreement must agree to share the cost of any required maintenance on the
engineered stormwater control, based upon a percentage calculated by taking the amount of built
upon area or drainage area from each site contributing flow to the engineered stormwater control and
dividing it by the total built upon area or drainage area flowing into the engineered stormwater control
from all sites; or
2. the property owner must maintain the engineered stormwater control and indemnify abutting users.
E. The agreement must provide that the expenditures for required maintenance will be validated by copies of
maintenance notifications and invoices for expenses incurred.
F. The agreement must provide that all parties will be notified when additional maintenance agreements are
made involving the engineered stormwater control. As part of notification, give total acreage involved with
the engineered stormwater control and the new pro-rata percentage for each property.
G. The agreement must not have an expiration date but must be perpetual.
H. The agreement must be recorded with the Guilford County Register of Deeds, along with the final plat.
I. Agreements involving an owners association must be made by and for the owners association.
J. The agreement must provide that amendments to the agreement relating to the maintenance and
ownership of the engineered stormwater control will not be permitted without review and approval by the
governmental office having jurisdiction for watershed protection.
K. The agreement must specify that the maintenance agreement can be voided only if all of the following
conditions exist:
1. both parties agree;
2. the off-site property owner complies with watershed protection requirements by some other means;
and
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 453
3. the governmental office having jurisdiction for watershed protection approves the new means of
watershed protection.
L. The owner of the engineered stormwater control has expended a significant amount of capital in the
construction of the engineered stormwater control and bears the burden of increased liability for his
property due to the existence of the engineered stormwater control and can therefore expect to recoup a
reasonable percentage of this cost as a result of this agreement. Reasonable will be interpreted in a
manner similar to the percentage of maintenance cost computation.
(Amended by Ord. 10-161 on 12/1/10)
30-13-6 Sites for Public Use
In subdividing property, due consideration must be given by the subdivider to the reservation of suitable sites

Carolina , as adopted by the North Carolina state Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land
Surveyors.
30-13-8 Condominium Development
Condominiums must be recorded in compliance with the North Carolina Condominium Act (NCGS §47C).
30-13-9 Owners' Associations
30-13-9.1 Establishment
A. Creation
An owners' association must be established to fulfill requirements of the North Carolina Condominium Act
and to accept conveyance and maintenance of all common elements and facilities within a subdivision or
development containing common elements. The owners' association must be in legal existence prior to the
conveyance, lease-option, or other long-term transfer of control of any unit or lot in the development.
B. Conveyance
Where developments have common elements serving more than one dwelling unit, these common
elements must be conveyed to the owners' association, in which all owners of lots in the development
must be members. All common elements other than public street rights-of-way, other areas dedicated to
the city, and lots must be designated as common elements. In a condominium development the common
element must be platted as common elements in accordance with the NC Condominium Act. In other
developments, fee-simple title must be conveyed by the subdivider or developer to the owners' association
when the plat is recorded.
C. Subdivision or Conveyance of Common Elements
Common elements may not subsequently be subdivided or conveyed by the owners' association unless a
revised preliminary plat and a revised final plat showing such subdivision or conveyance have been
submitted and approved.
D. Minimize Number of Associations
Developments, whether including different land uses, different types of housing, or simply different
sections, must hold the number of owners' associations to a minimum. An association may establish
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 454
different categories of membership, different budgets for the categories, and different rates of assessment
when different kinds of services are provided to different categories. Smaller associations under an
umbrella (master) association are permitted.
E. Owners' Association Not Required
A development involving only 2 units attached by a party wall (or 2 separate walls back-to-back) is not
required to have common elements or an owners' association. Such developments without an owners'
association must establish a maintenance agreement between owners to govern any party walls and to
ensure reciprocal easement rights needed for maintenance.
F. Common Elements in Subdivision Phases
Common elements required by this ordinance must be provided within each phase of the subdivision in an
amount proportional to the size of the phase under review. Common elements can be counted
cumulatively, including all sections recorded to date.
30-13-9.2 Submission of Owners' Association Declaration
After preliminary plat approval, and before any building permit issuance, it is recommended that the subdivider
submit for review and approval a draft of the declaration of the owners' association containing covenants and
restrictions governing the owners' association, lots or units, and common elements. Prior to or concurrently
with the submission of the final plat for review and approval, the subdivider must submit a copy of the final
declaration for review and approval. The declaration must include provisions for the following:
A. Membership
Membership in the owners' association is mandatory for each original purchaser and each successive
purchaser of a lot or unit. Provisions must be made for the addition of owners in subsequent sections of
the development.
B. Responsibilities of Association
The declaration must state that the owners' association is responsible for:
1. payment of premiums for liability insurance and local taxes and fees;
2. maintenance of recreational, engineered stormwater control and/or other facilities located on the
common elements; and
3. payment of assessments for all public and all private improvements made to or for the benefit of the
common elements.
C. Exterior Maintenance of Units
The owners' association must be made responsible for exterior maintenance of all attached units (whether
they be dwelling units or nonresidential units); or each unit owner must be made responsible, with the
owners' association granted authority to perform such exterior maintenance in the event the unit owner
fails to do so in a prompt and satisfactory manner and to assess the cost of the maintenance against the
unit.
D. Default By Association
If the owners' association defaults on payments to the jurisdiction entitled to payments of any
assessments for public improvements or ad valorem taxes levied against the common elements, and the
default continues for a period of 6 months or more, each owner of a lot in the development must pay to
the jurisdiction a portion of the taxes or assessments in an amount determined by dividing the total taxes
and/or assessments due to the jurisdiction by the total number of lots in the development. If the sum is
not paid by the owner 30 days following receipt of notice of the amount due, the sum will become a
continuing lien on the property of the owner, the owner's heirs, devisees, personal representatives, and
assigns. The taxing or assessing jurisdiction may either bring an action at law against the owner personally
obligated to pay, or may elect to foreclose the lien against the property of the owner.
E. Powers of the Association
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 455
The owners' association is empowered to levy assessments against the owners of lots or units within the
development. Such assessments must be for the payment of expenditures made by the owners'
association for the items set forth in this section, and any assessments not paid by the owner against
whom such assessments are made will constitute a lien on the lot of the owner.
F. Easements
Easements over the common elements for access, ingress, and egress from and to public streets and
walkways, and easements for enjoyment of the common elements and for parking, must be granted to
each lot owner.
G. Maintenance and Restoration
Provisions for maintenance and restoration in the event of destruction or damage must be established for
common element improvements and party walls.
H. Parking Allocation in Nonresidential Developments
In nonresidential owners' association developments, the declaration must contain the following provision:
"Parking spaces must be allocated among the individual lots or units in such a manner that each unit is
entitled to a sufficient number of parking spaces to comply with this ordinance for the use intended to be
located therein. The owners' association must maintain a register listing the total number of parking
spaces in the development and the number of spaces allocated to each lot or unit. A copy of this register
must be available to the Planning and Community Development Director upon request. The owners'
association may not reduce the number of parking spaces allocated to an individual lot or unit without the
express written consent of the subject owner, and in no case may the number of parking spaces allocated
to an individual lot or unit be reduced to a number below that required by this ordinance."
I. Owners Association with a Private Wastewater Treatment, Collection and Disposal System
The Declaration for an owners' association, responsible for the maintenance of a private wastewater
treatment, collection and disposal system, must contain the following provisions:
1. The wastewater collection system with pumps, wastewater treatment works, and/or disposal facilities,
including all appurtenances (the disposal system) must be part of the common elements.
2. The disposal system must be properly maintained and operated by the owners' association in
conformity with law and the provisions of the permit for construction, operation, repair and
maintenance of the system and facilities, as required by Title 15A, Subchapter 2T of the North Carolina
Administrative Code.
3. The disposal system must be maintained out of the common expenses of the owners' association, and
must receive the highest priority for expenditures by the owners' association except for federal, state
and local taxes and insurance.
4. In order to assure that there will be funds readily available to repair, maintain or construct the disposal
system, beyond the routine operation and maintenance expenses, a separate fund must be created
out of the common expenses. Such funds must be separate from the routine maintenance funds
allocated for the disposal system and must be part of the yearly budget.
5. In the event the common expense allocation and separate fund are not adequate for the construction,
repair and maintenance of the disposal system, the owners' association is authorized to levy special
assessments to cover the necessary costs. There will be no limit on the amount of special
assessments, and any such special assessments can be made as necessary at any time.
6. The owners' association may not enter into voluntary dissolution without first having transferred its
disposal system to another person acceptable to and approved by the North Carolina Environmental
Management Commission or appropriate delegated authority, by the issuance of a permit.
7. The owners' association may not transfer, convey, assign or otherwise relinquish or release its
responsibility for the operation and maintenance of its disposal system until a permit has been issued
by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission or appropriate delegated authority, to
the owners' association successor.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 456
30-13-10 Conversion of Nonconforming Development
If a nonconforming use or nonconforming building is converted into a condominium or other owners
association development, the declaration and final plat must disclose such nonconformity and explain potential
consequences of such nonconforming status.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 457
Article 14. Sign Regulations
30-14-1 Purpose
The sign regulations of this article are intended to achieve balance among the following differing, and at times,
competing goals:
30-14-1.1 to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication for businesses,
organizations and individuals;
30-14-1.2 to provide a means of way-finding, thus reducing traffic confusion and congestion;
30-14-1.3 to provide for adequate business identification, advertising, and communication;
30-14-1.4 to prohibit signs of such excessive size and number that they obscure one another to the
detriment of the economic and social well-being of the city;
30-14-1.5 to protect the safety and welfare of the public by minimizing hazards to pedestrian and
vehicular traffic;
30-14-1.6 to preserve property values by preventing unsightly and cluttered development that has a
blighting influence upon the community;
30-14-1.7 to differentiate among those signs that, because of their location or type, may distract
drivers on public streets and those that may provide information to them while they remain in their cars
but are out of active traffic and;
30-14-1.8 to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property.
30-14-2 Substitution of Messages
The sign regulations of this article are not intended to favor commercial speech over constitutionally-protected
political or noncommercial speech. A sign containing a noncommercial message may be substituted for any
sign containing a commercial message that is allowed by the regulations of this article.
30-14-3 Applicability
No sign may be placed, erected, altered, rebuilt, enlarged, extended or relocated except in conformity with this
article. The repainting or changing of the sign face and/or message and preventative maintenance of signs are

30-14-16.1 Sign Area
A. Box or Cabinet Signs
The area of a sign enclosed in frames or cabinetswhether the sign is attached or freestanding is
determined based on the outer dimensions of the frame or cabinet surrounding the sign face. However,
when a sign framed in a box or cabinet uses screened, raised (push-through), or routed out letters and an
opaque background, such signs must be measured as described in Paragraph B, below.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 477
Figure 14-3, Calculation of Sign Area
B. Individual Letter Signs
The area of an attached or freestanding sign comprised of individual letters or elements without a cabinet
or frame is determined by calculating the area of the smallest geometric figure (e.g. square, rectangle,
circle, polygon, etc) that can be drawn around the letters and/or elements. Signs consisting of individual
letters and/or elements will be measured as one sign when the distance between the letters and/or
elements is less than the largest dimension of the largest sign letter.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 478
Figure 14-4, Individual Letter Signs
C. Multi-Sided Signs
When the sign faces of a multi-sided sign are parallel or within 30 degrees of parallel, only one side is
counted. If the sign faces are not parallel or within 30 degrees of parallel, all sign faces are counted.
Figure 14-5, Multi-Sided Signs
30-14-16.2 Height
A. Sign height is the vertical distance from the top of the highest component of the sign to the higher of:
1. the base of the sign at the finished grade; or
2. the nearest adjacent street grade to which the sign is oriented and on which the lot has frontage.
City of Greensboro, North Carolina Land Development Ordinance - V20170818 Page 479
B. Finished grade is the grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating
solely for the purpose of locating the sign.
Figure 14-5, Calculation of Sign Height
30-14-16.3 Sign Clearance
Clearance is measured from the highest point of the ground directly below the sign to the lowest point on the
sign structure enclosing the sign face.
30-14-16.4 Lots with Multi-frontage
Unless otherwise expressly stated in this ordinance, lots fronting on 2 or more streets are allowed the
permitted sign area for each street frontage. When sign area is calculated based on building frontage or street
frontage, the total sign area allowed on each frontage must be calculated separately (and sign area derived
from one frontage may not be transferred to another frontage).

including adjacent riparian zone and flood-prone areas to its natural or referenced, stable conditions
considering recent and future watershed conditions. This process also includes restoring the geomorphic
dimension, pattern, and profile as well as biological and chemical integrity, including transport of water and
sediment produced by the streams watershed in order to achieve dynamic equilibrium. 'Referenced' or
'referenced reach' means a stable stream that is in dynamic equilibrium with its valley and contributing
watershed. A reference reach can be used to develop natural channel design criteria for stream restoration
projects.
