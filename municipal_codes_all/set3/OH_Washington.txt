   The regular sessions of Council shall be held on the second and fourth
Wednesdays of each month at 7:30 p.m. in the Council Chambers of the
Administration Building, 105 North Main Street.
('73 Code, § 121.01)  (Ord. 31-80, passed 10-16-80)
§ 30.11  NOTICE OF PUBLIC MEETINGS.
   Council hereby adopts the following rules and regulations for notice of
public meetings of Council.
   (A)   Meetings declared public. All meetings, including any prearranged
discussion of Council, are declared to be public meetings open to the public at
all times.
   (B)   Minutes of meetings. The minutes of such meetings, whether regular or
special, shall be promptly recorded and open to public inspection. The minutes
of executive sessions, as hereinafter provided, need only reflect the general
subject matter of items discussed in such executive sessions.
   (C)   Notice of meetings. Notice of the time and place of all the regular
meetings and notice of the time, place and purpose of all special meetings of
Council shall, in the case of the regular meeting, be given by the Clerk of
Council in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least 72 hours
prior to such regular meeting, and in the case of a special meeting, shall be
given by the Clerk to the news media that have requested notification at least
24 hours prior to such special meeting.  In the event of an emergency requiring
official action, the member or members calling the meeting shall notify the
news media that have requested notification immediately of the time, place and
purpose of the emergency meeting.
   (D)   Written request for notification.  Any person may, upon written
request and payment to the Clerk of a fee of $10 annually, receive advance
notification of all meetings at which any specific type of public business is
to be discussed.  Notification may include, but not be limited to, mailing the
agenda of the meetings to subscribers on a mailing list or in self-addressed,
stamped envelopes provided by the person making the request for notification.
   (E)   Executive sessions.  Members of Council may hold an executive session
only at a regular or special meeting for the sole purpose of the consideration
of the following matters:
      (1)   Unless the public employee, official, licensee or regulated
individual requests a public hearing, to consider the appointment, employment,
dismissal, discipline, promotion, demotion or compensation of a public employee
or official, or the investigation of charges or complaints against a public
employee, official, licensee or regulated individual.  Except as otherwise
provided by law, no public body shall hold an executive session for the
discipline of an elected official or conduct related to the performance of his
official duties or for his removal from office.
      (2)   To consider the purchase of property for public purposes or for the
sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of information
would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a person whose
personal, private interest is adverse to the general public interest.  No
member shall use this subsection as a subterfuge for providing covert
information to prospective buyers or sellers.  A purchase or sale of public
property is void if the seller or buyer of the public property has received
covert information from a member that has not been disclosed to the general
public in sufficient time for other prospective buyers and sellers to prepare
and submit offers.  If the minutes of Council show that all meetings and
deliberations of Council have been conducted in compliance with this section,
any instrument executed by the city, purporting to convey, lease or otherwise
dispose of any right, title or interest in any public property shall be
conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance with this section
insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide purchasers, lessees or
transferees of the property is concerned.
      (3)   Conferences with an attorney for the city, concerning disputes
involving the city that are the subject of pending or imminent court action.
      (4)   Preparing for, conducting or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment.
      (5)   Matters required to be kept confidential by federal law or rules or
state statutes.
      (6)   Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of
the matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the
purpose of committing or avoiding prosecution for a violation of the law.
   (F)   Validity of action. An ordinance, resolution, rule or formal action of
any kind is invalid unless adopted in an open meeting of Council.  An
ordinance, resolution, rule or formal action adopted in an open meeting that
results from deliberations in a meeting not open to the public is invalid
unless the deliberations were for a purpose specifically authorized herein and
conducted at an executive session held in compliance with this section.

§ 34.01  PAYMENT OF CERTAIN FIRE INSURANCE PROCEEDS TO THE CITY.
   The city is hereby authorized to utilize the procedures described in R.C. §
3929.86 Divisions C and D, whereby no insurance company, doing business in the
state, shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage, to a structure
located in the city, whereby the amount recovered for the fire loss to the
structure under all policies, exceeds the sum of $5,000 unless there is a
compliance with the following procedures.
   (A)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
company or companies equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of liability
on all fire policies covering the building or structure, the insurance company
or companies in accordance with R.C. § 715.26(F) shall transfer to the city in
the aggregate $1,000 for each $20,000, and each fraction of that amount, of a
claim, or, if at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named
insured or insureds and the insurance company or companies the named insured or
insureds have submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of
removing, repairing or securing the amount specified in the estimate.  Such
transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies insuring the
building or other structure.  Policy proceeds remaining after the transfer to
the city shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.  The named
insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of
removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure after the
transfer, and the city shall return the amount of the fund in excess of the
estimate to the named insured or insureds, provided that the city has not
commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.
   (B)   (1)   Upon receipt of proceeds of the city as authorized by this
section, the city shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely
as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing incurred
by the city pursuant to R.C. § 715.261.
      (2)   When transferring the funds as required in division (A) of this
section, an insurance company shall provide the city with the name and address
of the named insured or insureds, whereupon the city shall contact the named
insured or insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received by the city
and notify them that the following procedures will be followed:  The fund shall
be returned to the named insured or insureds when repair, removal or securing
of the building or other structure has been completed and the required proof
received by the City Manager, if the city has not incurred any costs for such
repair, removal or securing.  If the city has incurred any costs for repair,
removal or securing of the building or other structure, such costs shall be
paid from the fund to the named insured or insureds.  Nothing in this section
shall be construed to limit the ability of the city to recover any deficiency
under R.C. § 715.261.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit
the city and the named insured or insureds from entering into an agreement that
permits the transfer of funds to the named insured or insureds if some other
reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.

§ 34.05  JOB CREATION AND RETENTION INCENTIVE PROGRAM.
   (A)   Creation.  The city hereby establishes a Job Creation and Retention
Incentive Program in accordance with R.C. §§ 718.15 and 718.151.
   (B)   Purpose.  The purpose of the Job Creation and Retention Incentive
Program is to provide an incentive for the retention and creation of jobs in
the city, and to maintain the city’s competitiveness as a site for location of
new businesses and the expansion of existing businesses. The Job Creation and
Retention Incentive Program may be used in conjunction with other financing and
incentive programs available through the Federal Government, the State of Ohio,
other local governments, and/or any other city economic development incentive
programs.  Businesses annexing into the city will be eligible to apply for this
program.  At the time of annexation, all existing businesses and proposed new
business project activity may aggregate "new jobs," "retained jobs," and
"qualifying payroll" for the purpose of qualifying for the program.
   (C)   Definitions.  Unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning, the definitions set forth below shall apply in these
guidelines:
      (1)   NEW JOBS.  Jobs that have not previously existed in the city and
are associated with a qualifying payroll that are approved as new sources of
city income tax and are intended as permanent.
         (a)   For a job to be considered as a new source of city income tax it
must be determined by the city to be new work or a new position within the
business.
         (b)   Such new job must be created or moved into the city after the
employer's application for the Job Creation and Retention Incentive Program has
been submitted to the Director of Finance.
         (c)   A new job is considered to be intended as permanent if it is
designed by the employer to last for five or more years.
      (2)   RETAINED JOBS.  Jobs that currently exist in the city and are
associated with a qualifying payroll that are approved as sources of city
income tax and are intended as permanent.
         (a)   For a job to be considered as a source of city income tax it
must be determined by the city to be a job that would likely be relocated
outside the city if not for the job creation and retention incentive program.
         (b)   A retained job is considered to be intended as permanent if it
is designed by the employer to last for five or more years following the
employer's application for the Job Creation and Retention Incentive Program.
      (3)   QUALIFYING PAYROLL.  The dollar amount of the employer's additional
payroll attributable to the creation of new jobs or retention of retained jobs
in the city. To be approved the qualifying payroll must be equal to a minimum
of $200,000 in the aggregate.
      (4)   QUALIFIED BUSINESS.  Any business, owner of real property or
developer of real property which has qualified to participate in the Job
Creation and Retention Incentive Program and has entered into a contract with
the city governing the terms and conditions of participation in the Job
Creation and Retention Incentive Program ("Incentive Agreement").
      (5)   INCENTIVE PAYMENT.  Shall be calculated in accordance with an
incentive payment schedule to be established by the Director of Finance in
accordance with the terms of the incentive agreement.

         (b)   The incentive payment shall not exceed 50% of the income tax
revenue generated for the city as a result of the qualifying payroll in any
given year.
   (D)   Application process; Program administration.

Finance upon the advice and consult of the Director of Law. The application
process may be amended from time to time in accordance with this section.
      (2)   The city Job Creation and Retention Incentive Program shall be
administered by the Director of Finance, subject to the authority of the City
Manager to enter into contracts for the payment of the incentives, including
without limitation an incentive agreement. The Director of Finance shall be
responsible, subject to the guidelines set forth in this section, for
determining the actual percentage of qualifying payroll that will be used for
calculating each awardee's incentive payment.
      (3)   Interested property owners, developers and businesses must submit
an application seeking to participate in the program and obtain approval as a
qualified business. In all instances in which participation in the Job Creation
and Retention Incentive Program will be based upon new jobs, the application
must be submitted to the Director of Finance before any new jobs are located
within the city for which the applicant will be claiming the incentive.
   (E)   Eligible applicants.
      (1)   All forms of new and existing business located within, or annexing
into, the city are eligible to qualify for the incentive payment provided
herein, including but not limited to sole proprietorships, incorporations,

liability partnerships, whether as for-profit or nonprofit organizations, but
excluding governmental entities engaged in retail, commercial, manufacturing,
service, or any other type of lawful business.
      (2)   In addition to other considerations that may be deemed relevant and
necessary by the Director of Finance, at a minimum, each awardee of the Job
Creation and Retention Incentive Program must demonstrate:
         (a)   The qualified business will increase payroll for the qualified
business within the city and income tax revenue for the city;

opportunities for employment and strengthening the economy of the city; and
         (c)   Receiving the tax credit is a major factor in the qualified
businesses decision to go forward with creating the new jobs or with retaining
the retained jobs, as applicable.
   (F)   Incentive agreement.  The Director of Finance shall cause each
incentive agreement to include all of the following terms:
      (1)   A detailed description of the new jobs or the retained jobs, as
applicable, that are to be the subject of the incentive agreement;
      (2)   The term of the incentive agreement, which shall not exceed five
years, and the first year for which the credit may be claimed;
      (3)   A requirement that incentive payments are payable only after the
qualifying payroll has been maintained for one full calendar year.
      (4)   A requirement that the qualified business shall maintain operations
within the city for at least the term of the incentive agreement;
      (5)   The percentage, as determined by the Director of Finance but
subject to the limitations of this section, of excess income tax revenue that
will be allowed in respect of the qualifying payroll as the amount of the
credit for each tax year;
      (6)   The inflation-related pay increase factor, if any, to be applied to
the taxpayer's baseline and qualifying payroll income tax revenue for purposes
of calculating the incentive payment;
      (7)   A requirement that the qualified business annually shall report to
the Director of Development employment, tax withholding, investment, and other
information the Director needs to perform the Director's duties under this
section;
      (8)   A requirement that the qualified business file information on job
creation or retention and payroll for new jobs created or retained jobs
retained on an annual basis as of December 31 of each tax year throughout the
term of the incentive agreement so that the Director of Finance, in consult
with the Director of Law, can determine the appropriate qualifying payroll for
purposes of calculating the incentive payment and can audit compliance of the
awardee with the contract terms. New jobs and retained jobs data for the
previous year will be provided no later than April 30 of each year to the
Director of Finance. Information must be consistent with city, state and
federal tax filings;
      (9)   An agreement by the Director of Finance to pay to the qualified
business the amount of the incentive payment on the terms contained in the
incentive agreement; and
      (10)   A provision allowing the Director of Finance to recoup all
incentive payments in the event that information contained in a Job Creation
and Retention Incentive Program application, annual report, or incentive
agreement and provided to the Director of Finance by the qualified business is
inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect.
   (G)   Term of program.  The new jobs incentive program shall remain in
effect until July 31, 2022.  Any incentive payment contracts entered into prior

public funds have fiduciary responsibilities to the city and the public. Such
persons shall seek to follow an investment strategy based on the "prudent
person" standard. The prudent person standard requires the fiscal officer and
other fiduciaries to exercise the care, skill, and experience that a prudent
person would use to manage his personal financial affairs. The prudent person
standard requires the fiscal officer and other fiduciaries to seek investments
which will preserve principal while maximizing income.
(Ord. 1-97, passed 2-12-97)
§ 35.02  INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Preservation of principal. The primary investment objective is
preservation of principal. To meet the objective, portfolio diversification
will be established and maintained with a goal of generating portfolio income
that exceeds any losses in individual security values. It is recognized that
occasional losses are inevitable and such possibility will be considered in
evaluating diversification decisions and investment strategy.
   (B)   Liquidity.
      (1)   The second investment objective is maintenance of liquidity of
assets. This objective will be met by preparing a draw schedule for anticipated
expenditures and matching investment maturities with anticipated expenditure
dates whenever possible. Once cash flow requirements have been satisfied,
maturity date selection will be determined by market conditions and interest
rate forecasts. No unmatched investment will have a maturity date more than
five years from the settlement date. Investments made prior to September 26,
1996 that do not have a maturity date will be kept for no more than five years.
      (2)   No investment will be made unless, at the time the investment is
made, the fiscal officer reasonably believes that the investment can be held
until maturity. However, an investment may be sold prior to maturity if the
fiscal officer determines that such sale is prudent.
   (C)   Income maximization. Income maximization is the third investment
objective. To accomplish this objective, the investment portfolio will be
managed with the goal of producing income returns within acceptable risk
parameters. High financial risk is unacceptable. Thus, moderate income
volatility will be permitted, but no investments which are expected to be
subject to large interest rate fluctuations will be made.
   (D)   Minimization of cost of services. The fourth objective is to minimize
transaction costs. To meet this objective, relationships and securities
dealers, investment bankers, and other entities providing investment services
will be carefully managed to secure high quality services while simultaneously
minimizing costs.
(Ord. 1-97, passed 2-12-97)
§ 35.03  PERSONAL CONDUCT AND QUALIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Standards of conduct.
      (1)   The fiscal officer and staff must continually be aware of the
fiduciary nature of their responsibility for investing the public funds under
their control. All persons responsible for investment decisions or who are
involved in the management of the city's assets shall comply with all
applicable Ohio and federal statutes and regulations, the codes of conduct
established by the National Association of Securities Dealers and the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Code of Ethics and Standards of
Professional Conduct of the Association for Investment Management and Research.
      (2)   The Fiscal Officer and staff members are prohibited from having any
direct or indirect interests in any of the investments made by the fiscal
officer and from receiving payment, bonuses, or other compensation for
investment services in excess of their regular compensation.
      (3)   The fiscal officer may designate qualified staff members in his/her
office to take responsibility for executing individual investment transactions.
   (B)   Continuing education. The fiscal officer will annually complete the
continuing education programs provided by the Treasurer of State.
(Ord. 1-97, passed 2-12-97)
§ 35.04  TRANSACTIONS.
   (A)   A copy of this policy will be provided to all securities dealers,
investment bankers, and other entities doing investment business with the city.
Other interested parties may receive a copy upon request.
   (B)   No securities dealer, investment banker or other entity may provide
investment services to the city unless its representative has reviewed, signed,
and agreed on behalf of the entity, to abide by the terms of this policy.  In
signing this investment policy, the representative acknowledges that the entity
assumes full responsibility for recommending and making investments in
violation of any Ohio or federal  statute or regulation, regulation or code of
conduct established by the National Association of Securities Dealers or the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the terms of this policy, or any other
applicable law.
   (C)   While every effort will be made to obtain appropriate discounts,
investment firms will be selected to achieve the best possible transaction
execution.  The fact that a particular firm provides statistical and market
information and services will be considered in the selection process. All
investment firms selected shall be qualified to do business in the State of
Ohio, have all appropriate licenses, be in good standing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the
Ohio Department of Commerce's Division of Securities, and be on the list of
investment firms approved by the fiscal officer.  A periodic review of the
investment firms' capital and disciplinary standing will be conducted and
necessary changes in the list of approved investment firms will be approved by
the fiscal officer.
   (D)   All securities orders shall be placed according to accepted investment
practices.  All receipts confirming securities transactions will include the
trade date, par value, maturity, interest rate, price, yield, settlement date,
description of securities purchased, investment firm, amount due, and third-
party custodial information.  Confirmation receipts will be received within
three business days after the trade, and payment for investments shall only be
made upon receipt of the securities.
   (E)   All securities dealers, investment bankers and other entities
providing investment services to the city are prohibited from having any direct
or indirect interests in any of the investments made by the fiscal officer and
from receiving payment, bonuses, or other compensation for investment services
in excess of their regular compensation.  As used in this policy, "regular
compensation" includes the reasonable and agreed-upon fees, commissions, and
other compensation customarily associated with securities transactions earned
by outside securities dealers, investment bankers, and other entities providing
investment services to the city.

   (A)   Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by
this chapter.  Where necessary facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the industrial user's
cost and expense.  Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures
to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Superintendent for review,
and shall be approved by the Superintendent before construction  of the
facility if not in existence before passage of this chapter.  If deemed
necessary by the control authority the industrial user shall develop a Spill
Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan and submit the same to the
Superintendent within 180 days from filing application for an industrial waste
permit.  No industrial user who discharges to the POTW after the aforesaid date
shall be permitted to introduce pollutants  into the POTW system until said
Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan is approved by the
Superintendent.  Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by
the authority shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to
modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Industrial user shall notify the Superintendent immediately upon the
occurrence of a "slug" load, or accidental discharge of: substances prohibited
by this chapter or any discharge that by nature of its volume or content could
cause pass through or interference to the POTW.  The notification shall

schedule, to prevent the occurrence from happening again.  These reports shall
be confirmed in writing within five  days of the discharge and submitted on the
city's Accident Spill Form (WCH/MIPP-3) to the Superintendent.  Failure to
report shall be grounds for revocation of an industrial waste permit and
termination of sewer service.
   (D)   Any industrial user who discharges a slug load of prohibited materials
shall be liable for any expense, loss, damage, court costs, expenses of
litigation and/or reasonable attorney fees to the POTW, in addition to the
amount of any fines imposed on the authority on account thereof under state or
federal law.  In addition to which they may be liable to fines not to exceed
$1,000 per violation per day imposed by the city as deemed appropriate.
   (E)   Signs developed by the authority shall be posted by the industrial
user in conspicuous places on the industrial user's premises, advising

SEWER SERVICE CHARGES
§ 52.025  PURPOSE OF CHARGES.
   For the purpose of providing for the operation, maintenance and management
of the POTW system, for replacement and/or upgrading of the POTW system, for
payment of debt service incurred for the construction thereof, and for the cost
of administration of the pretreatment program, there is hereby levied the
following charges upon the users of the POTW system.
(Ord. 6-94, passed 4-27-94)
§ 52.026  SEWER SERVICE CHARGE.
   (A)   The sewer service charge shall be calculated based on the volume of
wastewater discharged directly or indirectly into the POTW system and shall be
measured by the water used by each sewer user as shown by the water meter
readings.  The sewer service charge for users of the city sewerage system are
shown in the Appendix.
   (B)   The sewer service charge will be audited annually by the City Council
to assure that the system is and will continue to be self sufficient and that
sufficient revenue is being generated from each user class in proper
proportions.
   (C)   The sewer service charge herein assessed shall be in addition to the
charge made for water.
   (D)   The users whose entire water usage is not disposed of through the POTW
system may apply for and be allowed a credit on their sewer bill for water
metered at an external point beyond their water meter that does not enter the
POTW system.  A flow meter shall be installed on the external water usage to
record the amount of sewer service credit.
   (E)   Where a private water supply is used by a user, the authority may
require a meter be installed, at the user's expense, on that source to
determine the sewer service charge, or may at its option charge a flat rate per
month for sewer service as shown in the Appendix.
(Ord. 6-94, passed 4-27-94)
§ 52.027  MUNICIPAL/INDUSTRIAL PRETREATMENT PROGRAM CHARGES.
   The MIPP charge for significant and minor significant industrial users shall
be based on the services rendered to an industrial user on a monthly basis plus
an MIPP administrative charge to manage the program.  The MIPP charge for
industrial users of the POTW system are shown in the Appendix.
(Ord. 6-94, passed 4-27-94)
§ 52.028  IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   There is hereby established a customer equivalary unit (CEU) fee of
$300 per CEU.
   (B)   This fee is based on the plant infrastructure needs for each average
residential customer (which is hereby defined to be 9,000 gallons per month of
usage).
   (C)   This CEU is also based on "normal domestic sewage" BOD, TSS and other
contaminant levels as indicated in the §
52.001.  The city shall calculate a prorated volume equivalency for customers
discharging high strength waste.
   (D)   The impact fee shall be charged in addition to the appropriate tap fee
and shall apply beginning with the third CEU. The second CEU shall pay an
impact fee of one-half of the charge indicated above. It shall apply to
businesses and industries when the volume of water consumption increases due to
a change of operation or an expansion in operation results in or is expected to
result in an increased consumption of water.
   (E)   The impact fee shall be calculated using the Ohio EPA model analysis
of water which estimates the usage requirements for residences businesses and
industries.  The city shall be solely responsible for any water use
determination of comparable uses not specifically and directly covered on the
EPA model list.
   (F)   If an individual or company chooses, the impact fee may be calculated
based on actual usage.  In such cases the customer will pay the calculated rate
at the time of issuance of the building permit.  A review of this impact fee
based on actual water usage will be made at the end of the third year of
operation.  A refund or additional assessment will be assessed at that time
based on the actual CEU impact.  After the third year no additional review or
adjustment will be made unless the company actually expands their operation
through remodeling or new construction.
   (G)   The Service Committee shall review and approve each impact fee
calculation.  At the request of the Community Improvement Corporation (CIC),
Council may consider waiving this fee for the overall economic benefit of the
community.
(Ord. 20-95, passed 12-13-95)
 § 52.029  ADMINISTRATIVE DISCOUNT FOR EARLY PAYMENT; FEES FOR LATENESS.
   (A)   Administrative discount for early payment.  An administrative discount
of 10% of the monthly charge shall be applied to all accounts which are paid on
time according to the timetables of the monthly billing cycle as indicated on
the bill. The sewer rate as presently enacted by Council in this chapter are
the discounted rates. This discount shall be reflected on the monthly bills as
soon as practical (due to computer programming) after the passage of these
provisions. Until the implementation date, the current penalty provisions
currently enacted will remain in effect.
   (B)   Late handling and late notice fee. 
      (1)   A fee of 10% of the monthly charge for sewer shall be added to each
bill 30 days following the payment due date. This charge will coincide with the
mailing of turn off notices and is intended to help offset the cost of this
additional handling and processing.
      (2)   Once the late handling fee has been assessed and their service
disconnected, no additional monthly penalties will be accumulated against the
sewer bill.
   (C)   Set up fee.  There is hereby established a non-refundable $25 set up
fee.  This fee shall be collected from all customers when they apply for water
service, sewer service, or both. If customers sign up for sewer and water
service at the same time, only one fee shall be charged. The current $50
deposit charge shall be abolished and all codes and policies relating to
deposits charges are hereby by repealed.
(Ord. 20-95, passed 12-13-95
§ 52.030  CONSTRUCTION FEES.
   Line extensions and connections made off lines constructed by city employees
(excluding replacement lines, and lines built for subdivisions which are paid
for in advance) will be subject to charges based upon front foot or per lot
assessments in addition to the tap and impact fee charges.  These construction
fees will be negotiated and established based on the actual cost of
construction and will be approved by the Council Service Committee prior to
implementation.

   (D)   Public fire protection.  For the maintenance and use of each fire
hydrant located outside the city limits, in Union Township, Fayette County,
Ohio, and for supplying water to flush sewers, an annual charge of $319.20,
payable in equal monthly installments due on or before the 15th day of the
month for which the service is provided, shall be imposed upon and paid by the
Township.  For the maintenance and use of each fire hydrant now installed and
to be continued in use in the city hereunder and for water for flushing sewers,
the city shall pay to the Water Revenue Fund an annual charge of $266.28, and
for each fire hydrant hereafter installed it shall pay an annual charge of
$266.28, such charges to be paid in equal monthly installments on or before the
15th day of the month following the month during which the service was
rendered.
   (E)   Administrative charge for late payments.  An administrative charge for
late payments of 5% of the monthly charge shall be added to all accounts still
outstanding on any succeeding billing date.
   (F)   Dishonored checks.  An administrative charge of $20 will be assessed
if a check received as payment for a water bill is dishonored by the bank. At
the city's option, the charge will be imposed at the time the check is returned
or included on the customer's next billing.
   (G)   Disconnection of service.  All water service to delinquent users shall
be disconnected without further notice if the account is 30 days late in
payment and more than $25 in arrears and after a 15-day notice of disconnect
has been served on the property announcing the shut off of the service.
Disconnection can also occur if the user fails to provide access to the
property served, for the purpose of installing, reading or maintaining the
metering systems, after being given notice and a reasonable time in which to
comply with such notice.  Shut off of service under these circumstances shall
be immediate.
   (H)   Reconnection fees.  A charge of $25 for reconnection during regular

      (1)   The following schedule of water tap fees is established for new
residential and commercial consumers starting in year 2009:
 
Water 2009 2011 2013
5/8 inch   $1,200  $1,600  $2,000
3/4 inch   $1,200  $1,600  $2,000
1 inch     $1,200  $1,600  $2,000
1.5 inches $2,000  $2,500  $3,000
2 inches   $3,000  $3,750  $4,600

12 inches  $15,000 $18,750 $23,450
 
      (2)   All tap fees shall be reviewed by the Finance and Service
Committees every five years beginning in year 2008.  All tap connections for
2008 shall remain at the old tap fee.
   (J)   Administrative discount for early payment.  An administrative discount
of 10% of the monthly charge shall be applied to all accounts which are paid on
time according to  the  timetables of the monthly billing cycle as indicated on
the bill. The water rates as presently enacted by Council in this chapter are
the discounted rates. This discount shall be reflected on the monthly bills as
soon as practical (due to computer prograrnrning) after the passage of these
provisions. Until the implementation date, the current penalty provisions
currently enacted will remain in effect.
   (K)   Late handling and late notice fee. 
      (1)   A fee of 10% of the monthly charge for water shall be added to each
bill 30 days following the payment due date. This charge will coincide with the
mailing of turn off notices and is intended to help offset the costs of this
additional handling and processing.
      (2)   Once the late handling fee has been assessed and the service
disconnected, no additional monthly penalties will be accumulated against the
water bill.
   (L)   There is hereby established a non-refundable $25 set up fee. This fee
shall be collected from all customers when they apply for water service, sewer
service, or both. If customers sign up for sewer and water service at the same
time, only one fee shall be charged. The current $50 deposit charge shall be
abolished and all codes and policies relating to deposit charges are hereby
repealed.
   (M)  Lien for charges.
      (1)   No water or sewer disposal service shall be furnished or rendered
free of charge to any customer.
      (2)   Current water service may be refused or discontinued to any person,
whether tenant or owner, for failure to pay an unpaid charge for which he was
responsible by virtue of use of service or property ownership at any previous
place of residence or ownership.  This rule shall in no way reduce the
responsibility of a property owner for the water or sewer charge applicable for
the premises owned.  Should a customer who is known to have left a bill at a
previous location attempt to sign up or continue utility services for a water
or sewer account, the city shall require that this past responsibility be
satisfied before the new service is engaged or service continued.
      (3)   Current water service may be refused or discontinued to any
customer or premises for failure to pay an unpaid charge of an occupant thereof
if there is reason to believe the customer is applying for water in an effort
to avoid paying a delinquent charge of a fellow occupant.
   (N)   (1)   All water customers with service connection within the city
limits of the city shall be given a discount on the existing monthly water bill
of 10%.  This credit shall apply to each monthly bill in a manner approved by
the State Auditor's Office. The credit amount shall automatically expire
December 31, 1995.
      (2)   Beginning January 1, 1996 this discount amount for the calendar
year shall be reported to Council and approved and adopted by Council as part
of the 1996 Budget Ordinance.  This discount amount shall automatically expire
December 31, 1996.
      (3)   Beginning January 1, 1997 this discount amount for the calendar
year shall be reported to Council and approved and adopted by Council as part
of the 1997 Budget Ordinance.  This discount amount shall automatically expire
December 31, 1997.
      (4)   Beginning at any time in this process, but no later than January 1,
1998, this program will end and if a permanent adjustment is needed, Council
will enact appropriate rates to collect needed monies without regard to
discounts or surcharges.

CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL
§ 53.30  PURPOSE.
   (A)   To protect the public potable water supply of the city from the
possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within the customer's
internal distribution system(s) or the customer's private water system(s) such
contaminants or pollutants that could backflow into the public water system;
   (B)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross connections,
actual or potential, between the customer's in-plant potable water system(s)
and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures, and industrial piping systems;
and,
   (C)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control that will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
(Ord. 13-2000, passed 4-26-00)
§ 53.31  RESPONSIBILITY.
   The Service Director or his/her representative shall be responsible for the
protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination
or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the
water service connection. If, in the judgement of said Service Director or his/
her representative an approved backflow-prevention assembly is required (at the
customer's water service connection; or, within the customer's private water
system) for the safety of the water system, the Service Director or his/her
representative or his/her designated agent shall give notice in writing to said
customer to install such an approved backflow-prevention assembly(s) at
specific location(s) on his/her premises. The customer shall immediately
install such approved assembly(s) at his/her own expense; and, failure,
refusal, or inability on the part of the customer to install, have tested, and
maintain said assembly(s) shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water
service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met.
(Ord. 13-2000, passed 4-26-00)
§ 53.32  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise, the meaning of terms
used in this subchapter shall be as follows:
   AIR GAP.  The unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere
between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet conveying water or waste to
a tank, plumbing fixture, receptor, or other assembly and the flood level rim
of the receptacle. These vertical, physical separations must be at least twice
the diameter of the water supply outlet, never less than one inch (25 mm).
   APPROVED.  Accepted by the authority responsible as meeting an applicable
specification stated or cited in this subchapter or as suitable for the
proposed use.
   AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY.  Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than the purveyor's approved public water supply. These auxiliary waters
may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any
natural source(s), such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, and so forth;
used waters; or industrial fluids. These waters may be contaminated or
polluted, or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water
source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control.
   BACKFLOW.  The undesirable reversal of flow in a potable water distribution
system as a result of a cross connection.
   BACKFLOW PREVENTER.  An assembly or means designed to prevent backfow.
   BACKPRESSURE.  A pressure, higher than the supply pressure, caused by a
pump, elevated tank, boiler, or any other means that may cause backflow.
   BACKSIPHONAGE.  Backflow caused by negative or reduced pressure in the
supply piping.
   CONTAMINATION.  An impairment of a potable water supply by the introduction
or admission of any foreign substance that degrades the quality and creates a
health hazard.
   CROSS CONNECTION.  A connection or potential connection between any part of
a potable water system and any other environment containing other substances in
a manner that, under any circumstances would allow such substances to enter the
potable water system. Other substances may be gases, liquids, or solids, such
as chemicals, waste products, steam, water from other sources (potable or
nonpotable), or any matter that may change the color or add odor to the water.
   CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL BY CONTAINMENT.  The installation of an approved
backflow-prevention assembly at the water service connection to any customer's
premises, where it is physically and economically unfeasible to find and
permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross connections
within the customer's water system; or it shall mean the installation of an
approved backflow-prevention assembly on the service line leading to and supply
a portion of a customer's water system where there are actual or potential
cross connections that cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the
point of the cross connections.
   CROSS CONNECTIONS, CONTROLLED.  A connection between a potable water system
and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow-prevention assembly
properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the
protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.
   DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY.  The approved double check valve assembly
consists of two internally loaded check valves, either spring loaded or
internally weighted, installed as a unit between two tightly closing resilient-
seated shutoff valves and fittings with properly located resilient-seated test
cocks. This assembly shall only be used to protect against a nonhealth hazard
(that is, a pollutant).
   HAZARD, DEGREE OF.  The term is derived from an evaluation of the potential
risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable
water system.
   HAZARD, HEALTH.  A cross connection or potential cross connection involving
any substance that could, if introduced in the potable water supply, cause
death, illness, spread disease, or have a high probability of causing such
effects.
   HAZARD, NONHEALTH.  A cross connection or potential cross connection
involving any substance that generally would not be a health hazard but would
constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable, if introduced into the
potable water supply.
   HAZARD, PLUMBING.  A plumbing-type cross connection in a consumer's potable
water system that has not been properly protected by an approved air gap or an
approved backflow-prevention assembly.
   HAZARD, SYSTEM.  An actual or potential threat of severe damage to the
physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer's
potable water system or of a pollution or contamination that would have a
protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system
   INDUSTRIAL FLUIDS SYSTEM.  Any system containing a fluid or solution that
may be chemically, biologically, or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a
form or concentration, such as would constitute a health, system, pollution, or
plumbing hazard, if introduced into an approved water supply. This may include,
but not be limited to: polluted or contaminated waters; all types for process
waters and used waters originating from the public potable water system that
may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid form; plating
acids and alkalies; circulating cooling waters connected to an open cooling
tower; and/or cooling towers that are chemically or biologically treated or
stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters, such as wells,
springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals or systems,
and so forth; oils, gases, glycerine, paraffins, caustic and acid solutions,
and other liquid and gaseous fluids used in industrial or other purposes for
fire-fighting purposes.
   POLLUTION.  The presence of any foreign substance in water that tends to
degrade its quality so as to constitute a nonhealth hazard or impair the
usefulness of the water.
   REDUCED-PRESSURE BACKFLOW-PREVENTION ASSEMBLY.  The  approved reduced-
pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly consists of two independently
acting approved check valves together with a hydraulically operating,
mechanically independent pressure differential relief valve located between the
check valves and below the first check valve. These units are located between
two tightly closing resilient-seated shutoff valves as an assembly and equipped
with properly located resilient-seated test cocks.
   SERVICE CONNECTION.  The terminal end of a service connection from the
public potable water system, that is, where the water purveyor loses
jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to
the customer's water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service
connection, then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the
meter. There should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of
any meter or backflow-prevention assembly located at the point of delivery to
the customer's water system. Service connection shall also include water
service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency
water service connections from the public potable water system.
   WATER COMMISSIONER.  The supervisor in charge of the water plant/
distribution system of the city is invested with the authority and
responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross-connection control
program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this subchapter.
   WATER, NONPOTABLE.  Water that is not safe for human consumption or that is
of questionable quality.
   WATER, POTABLE.  Water that is safe for human consumption as described by
the public health authority having jurisdiction.

water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point
of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the water purveyor.
(Ord. 13-2000, passed 4-26-00)
§ 53.33  WATER SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The water system shall be considered as made up of two parts: the
utility system and the customer system.
   (B)   Utility system shall consist of the source facilities and the
distribution system, and shall include all those facilities of the water system
under the complete control of the utility, up to the point where the customer's
system begins.
   (C)   The source shall include all components of the facilities utilized in
the production, treatment, storage, and delivery of water to the distribution
system.
   (D)   The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for
the delivery of water from the source to the customer's system.
   (E)   The customer's system shall include those parts of the facilities
beyond the termination of the utility distribution system that are utilized in
conveying utility-delivered domestic water to points of use.
(Ord. 13-2000, passed 4-26-00)
§ 53.34  POLICY.
   (A)   No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or
maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as
required by state laws and regulations and the laws/regulations of the city. 
Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if
a backflow-prevention assembly required by the Backflow/Cross Connections
Ordinance is not installed, tested, and maintained, or if it is found that a
backflow-prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected
cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until
such conditions or defects are corrected.
   (B)   The customer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable
times to authorized representatives of the city Service Department to determine
whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including
violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known,
the city representatives shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the
premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the
customer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with state and city
statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted
pursuant thereto.
   (C)   An approved backflow-prevention assembly shall be installed on each
service line to a customer's water system at or near the property line or
immediately inside the building being served; but in all cases, before the
first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following
conditions exist:
      (1)   In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply that is
not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and that is not
acceptable as an additional source by the service director or his
representative, the public water system shall be protected against backflow
from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the
service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard.
      (2)   In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other
objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual
or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be
protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved
backflow-prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of
hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters
originating from the utility system that have been subject to deterioration in
quality.
      (3)   In the case of premises having internal cross connections that
cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or intricate plumbing and
piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not
readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or
impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the
public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by
installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line.
   (D)   The type of protective assembly required under subdivisions (C)(1),
(2) and (3) shall depend upon the degree of hazard that exists as follows:
      (1)   In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water
supply as stated in subdivision (C)(1) of this section and it is not subject to
any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an
approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-
prevention assembly.
      (2)   In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that
would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the
public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved
double check valve assembly.
      (3)   In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous
to health that is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential
hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected
by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle
backflow-prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will
exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical
manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries, and plating plants.
      (4)   In the case of any premises where there are "uncontrolled" cross
connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be
protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure
principle backflow-prevention assembly at the service connections.
      (5)   In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements
or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make
a complete in plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be
protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air-gap
separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention
assembly on each service to the premises.
      (6)   In the case of any premises where, in the opinion of the service
director or his representative, an undue health threat is posed because of the
presence of extremely toxic substances, the service director or his
representative may require an air-gap at the service connection to protect the
public water system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the service
director or his representative and is dependent on the degree of hazard.
   (E)   Any backflow-prevention assembly required herein shall be a model and
size approved by the service director or his representative. The term approved
backflow-prevention assembly shall mean an assembly that has been manufactured
in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works
Association titled:
      AWWA C510-89 - Standard for Double Check Valve Back flow-Prevention
Assembly, and
      AWWA C511-89 - Standard for Reduced-Pressure Principle Backflow-
Prevention Assembly,
and have met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of
the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research of the
University of Southern California established by "Specification of Backflow-
Prevention Assemblies" - Sec. 10 of the most current issue of the Manual of
Cross-Connection Control.  Said AWWA and FCCHR standards and specifications
have been adopted by the service director or his representative.  Final
approval shall be evidenced by a certificate of approval issued by an approved
testing laboratory certifying full compliance with said AWWA standards and
FCCHR specifications.
      (1)   The following testing laboratory has been qualified by the water
commissioner or health officer to test and certify backflow preventers:
         Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research
         University of Southern California
         University Park
         Los Angeles, CA 90089
      (2)   Testing laboratories, other than the laboratory listed above, will
be added to an approved list as they are qualified by the Service Director or
his/her representative.
      (3)   Backflow preventers that may be subjected to backpressure or
backsiphonage that have been fully tested and have been granted a certificate
of approval by said qualified laboratory and are listed on the laboratory's
current list of approved backflow-prevention assemblies may be used without
further testing or qualification.
   (F)   It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where
backflow-prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and
operational tests made at least once per year. In those instances where the
Service Director or his/her representative deems the hazard to be great enough,
certified inspections may be required at more frequent intervals. These
inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be
performed by the assembly manufacturer's representative, water department
personnel, or by a certified tester approved by the Service Director or his/her
representative. It shall be the duty of the Service Director or his/her
representative to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The
customer-user shall notify the Service Director or his/her representative in
advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that the customer-user may
witness the tests if so desired. These assemblies shall be repaired,
overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever said
assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs, and
overhaul shall be kept and made available to the Service Director or his/her
representative.
   (G)   All presently installed back flow-prevention assemblies that do not
meet the requirements of this section but were approved assemblies for the
purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been
properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance
requirements under division (F), be excluded from the requirements of these
rules so long as the Service Director or his/her representative is assured that
they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing
assembly is moved from the present location, requires more than minimum
maintenance, or when the Service Director or his/her representative finds that
the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by
an approved backflow-prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this
section.

§ 54.01  MANDATORY CHARGE FOR SERVICE.
   (A)   No water or sewer disposal for service shall be furnished or rendered
free of charge to any customer.
   (B)   In the event that any user fails to pay in full water or sewer charges
required by this section, or to conform in any other respects to this chapter,
the city shall give notice of the action or default on the part of the user. If
the account is not then paid or the default corrected the water and/or sewer
service to that user shall  be cut off.  At the expiration of  the 15 day
period,  or at the expiration of some agreed extension beyond 15 days, the
customer's service may be discontinued by the city at any time without further
notice. After the physical discontinuance of any sewer service, the division of
sanitary engineering of the Ohio EPA or other appropriate regulating agency
shall immediately be notified of the action and the name and address of the
customer.
      (1)   Current water or sewer service may be refused or discontinued to
any customer, whether tenant or owner, for a failure to pay an unpaid water or
sewer charge for which he was responsible by virtue of use of service or
property ownership at any previous place of residence or ownership. This rule
shall in no way reduce the responsibility of a property owner for the water or
sewer charge applicable for the premises owned. Should a customer who is known
to have left a bill at a previous location attempt to sign up or continue
utility services for a water or sewer account, the city shall require that this
past responsibility be satisfied before the new service is engaged or service
continued.
      (2)   Current water service may be refused or discontinued to any
customer or premises for failure to pay an unpaid charge of an occupant
thereof, if there is reason to believe the customer is applying for water, or
continuing its use in an effort to avoid paying a delinquent charge of a fellow
occupant or allowing the habitation in order to avoid the charges.
      (3)   Water or sewer service may be refused or discontinued for failure
to make repairs on a service line.
      (4)   Water service will be disconnected immediately upon notification of
discontinuance of a service contract until a final bill is paid and a new
service contract is initiated. This provision includes a refusal to supply
water or sewer service to a residence or business until a previously incurred
final bill or delinquency is satisfied.
      (5)   Any water or sewer service abandoned by the property owner shall be
shut off at the water main or curb box, at the option of the Service Director,
at the owner's expense.
      (6)   If the city finds that as a result of the customer's willful act a
meter seal has been broken, or any bypass inserted, or there is other evidence
that the meter has been tampered with, the water may be shut off. In such
instances reconnection will not recur until a reconnection charge has been
paid, the meter is established to be in proper working order, and the water and
sewer bill has been paid to its current status, together with any estimated
amount which may be necessary to determine as a result of the customer's
tampering, and a security deposit has been posted.
(Ord. 6-96, passed 4-10-96)
§ 54.02  BILLING PRACTICE.
   (A)   A charge for water and sewer will be issued for each billing period.
The charge will normally be determined from the difference between two
consecutive meter readings. When, for any reason, a meter reading has not been
obtained, the charge may be `estimated' from quantities of water used during
previous periods. Improved accessible property shall be billed the base cost
for water and sewer service, whether or not the service is used and regardless
of whether the meter has been turned off. Improved accessible property shall be
deemed to be a property located within 150 feet of a water or sewer main, or is
(or was) physically connected to the water or sewer system regardless of its
distance from a main. Accessibility shall not apply to properties outside of
the city corporation limits until they have been connected to the water or
sewer system.
   (B)   If an improved accessible property has been condemned and its meter
removed, no charges will be levied against the property. Meter removal on a
temporary basis will not relieve the owner of payment of a water or sewer bill
under this section.
   (C)   The city shall endeavor to give proper notice of water and sewer
service charges, but by law cannot guarantee delivery of the mail. Failure to
receive notice by mail shall not excuse customers from prompt payment of
charges. It shall be the established policy of the city to accept total and
complete payments for charges billed.
(Ord. 6-96, passed 4-10-96)

§ 54.06  PROMPT PAYMENT DISCOUNT.
   An administrative discount of 10% of the monthly charge shall be applied to
all accounts which are paid on time according to the timetables of the monthly
billing cycle as indicated on the bill. The water and sewer rates as enacted in
§§
54.03,

to each bill 30 days following the previous billing date. The actual date of
implementation of this additional charge may vary somewhat from a 30 day
schedule depending on conflicts with holidays, weekends or other scheduling
difficulties. This charge will coincide with the mailing of turn off notices
and is intended to help offset the costs of this additional handling and
processing.
   (B)   Once the late handling fee has been assessed and the service
disconnected, no additional monthly penalties will be accumulated against the
water and sewer bill. There will, however, continue to be assessed a base cost
for water and sewer as indicated in §
54.03.

§ 54.15  NEW CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      CONSENT ORDER.  The Consent Order filed January 5, 2007 with the Fayette
County Common Pleas Court, captioned State of Ohio v. City of Washington Court
House, Case No. 06-CVH-00352.
      SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOW or SSO. An overflow, spill, or release of
wastewater from the city’s sanitary sewer system, including interceptor sewers,
that occurs on a city street or on the ground and has the potential to reach
waters of the state without treatment. SSOs do not include WIBs unless the
wastewater is discharged or otherwise released to the street or to where it can
enter a storm sewer system.
      TAP or SEWER TAP. The connection of a building lateral to the city’s
sewer system with a projected daily average flow of 400 gallons per day or less
of wastewater.
      WATER IN BASEMENT or WIB. Wastewater backups into buildings that are
caused by blockages or flow conditions in a sanitary sewer other than a
building lateral. WIBs do not include the backup of sewage caused by a blockage
or other malfunction in the building’s lateral sewer.
      WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT  or WWP. The City of Washington Court House’s
wastewater treatment works/disposal system, located at 1210 South Elm Street,
Washington Court House, Fayette County, and any other facilities for treatment
of the sewage, industrial waste, or other wastes collected in the city’s sewer
system.
   (B)   Limits. There is hereby established a limit on the number of new sewer
taps allowed per calendar year. This limit shall be enforced until the System
Evaluation and Capacity Assurance Plan (“SECAP”), which is required by Item VI,
Section 13 of the Consent Order, captioned State of Ohio v. Washington Court
House, Case No. 06-CVH-00352, is approved by the Ohio EPA and the SECAP
schedule required by paragraph 14 is approved by the Ohio EPA, and incorporated
into the Consent Order.
   (C)   Application process for non-domestic sewage permit. Any person seeking
a sewer tap permit from the city for non-domestic sewage must submit a written
application (on a for prescribed by the city) to the Service Director. The
applicant must describe the estimated volume of projected flow, the nature of
the user’s operations, a description of the user’s waste streams, and a
description of what is expected to be present in the wastewater. Prior to
authorizing the connection/expansion of a new or expanded significant
industrial the city will evaluate this application, and submit a copy of the
application, along with a proposal for how many taps should be assigned for
each non-domestic sewage application to the Ohio EPA for review and approval.
   (D)   Application process for domestic sewage permit. Any person seeking a
sewer tap permit from the city for domestic sewage must submit a written
application (on a form prescribed by the city) to the Service Director. The
applicant must describe the number of residential units sought to be served,
provide an estimate of the volume of projected flow, and state the number of
“taps” sought, keeping in mind that a projected daily average flow of 400
gallons per day or less of wastewater is considered one “tap.” Prior to
authorizing the connection/expansion, the Service Director will evaluate the
number of taps already granted in the current calendar year to ensure the city
does not violate any terms of the Consent Order.
   (E)   Review criteria. The Service Director will review each application on
a first-come, first-served basis. The Service Director is hereby authorized to
evaluate each tap application with the goal toward obtaining control and
prohibiting new taps above SSOs such that any new tap will not significantly
increase the occurrence, frequency, duration, or magnitude of any SSO.
   (F)   Carryover. In the event that the city does not utilize 200 taps within
a calendar year (January 1 through December 31), any unused taps will carryover
for usage in the following calendar year. No taps shall carry over for more
than one year (i.e., to the immediately following year). At no time shall the
number of available taps in any one calendar year exceed 400.
   (G)   Monitoring. The Service Director shall limit, manage, and monitor the
number of new taps made to the city’s sewer system such that SSOs and/or
blending at the WWTP will not be increased.
   (H)   Reports. The Service Director shall submit semi-annual reports of the
number of taps allowed into the city sewer system. Each report shall identify
the location and number of taps allowed, total flow from the taps allowed, and
the number of available remaining taps for the calendar year. The reports shall
be due to the Ohio EPA on or before May 15 and November 15 of each year until
such report is no longer required by the terms of the Consent Order.
   (I)   For each new water or sewer connection the person or firm applying for
service shall pay a connection fee as follows:
      (1)   For single family residences, a fee of $400 each for water and
sewer, which shall become effective November 1, 1996. This fee shall be changed
to $500 on May, 1, 1998, and $700 on November 1, 1999.
      (2)   Non-residential connection fees for water or sewer which are
serviced by a water meter of 1" size or smaller, shall each be subject to a
connection fee of $700.
      (3)   All connections made outside the corporate boundaries of the city
shall pay a 25% surcharge.
      (4)   All connections made for services greater than 1" shall be charged
a fee equal to the cost of making the connection and the associated capital
costs assigned to their share of the waste treatment plant and distribution
system. A schedule of these costs will be prepared and approved by the Council
Finance and Service Committees. The costs and charges for large services shall
be reviewed and revised at least once each three years.
      (5)   All connection fees shall be due and payable at the time of the
issuance of a building permit for new construction or the application for
service in the case of existing structures.
      (6)   Multi-family residences shall pay a connection fee according to the
charge schedule outlined in division (I)(1) of this section if it is serviced
by a meter of 1" size of smaller. If it is serviced by a larger meter, the
connection charges will be levied in accordance with the schedule to be
implemented under division (A)(4) of this section.

§ 54.16  IMPACT FEES.
   Businesses, industries, and multifamily businesses add additional impact to
the water and sewer infrastructure of the city and are therefore subject to the
additional charges in addition to the connection charges outlined in §
54.15.
   (A)   There is hereby established a customer equivalency unit (CEU) fee of
$500 per CEU.
   (B)   This fee is based on the plant infrastructure needs for each average
residential customer, which is hereby defined to be 1,000 cubic feet of water
usage per month.
   (C)   This CEU is also based on “normal domestic strength waste” as
indicated in the Sewer Code of the city.  The city shall have the sole
authority to calculate a prorated volume equivalency for customers discharging
high strength waste.
   (D)   The impact fee shall be charged in addition to the appropriate
connection fee (see § 54.15) and shall apply in the following manner. For the
first CEU no impact fee shall apply. The second CEU shall be subject to a
charge equal to one-half of the charge of a full CEU. All CEUs after the second
CEU shall be subject to a full equivalency charge as indicated in this section.
   (E)   The impact fee shall apply to residences, businesses and industries
when the volume of water or sewer consumption increases due to a change in the
operations, procedures, or facilities which results in or is expected to result
in an increase in the consumption of water or sewer services.
   (F)   The impact fee shall be calculated using the Ohio EPA model analysis
of water which estimates the usage requirements for residences, businesses, and
industries. The city shall be solely responsible for any water use
determination of comparable uses not specifically covered on the EPA model
list.
   (G)   If an individual or company chooses, the impact fee may be calculated
based on actual usage. In such cases the customer will pay the calculated fee
based on the calculated rate at the time of the issuance of the building
permit. A review of this impact fee based on actual water usage will be made at
the end of the third year of operational.  A refund or additional assessment
will be levied at that time based on the actual CEU impact. A similar review
will take place after the third year of operation. Following this review, no
additional review or adjustment will be made unless the company actually
expands their operation through remodeling, new construction, or some change in
procedures or operations. This calculation procedure shall not apply to multi-
family housing complexes.
   (H)   The Service Committee of Council shall review and approve each impact
fee calculation. At the request of the Community Improvement Corporation (CIC)
or city administration, Council may consider waiving this fee for the overall
economic benefit of the community.
   (I)   The impact fee rate established in this section shall apply to all
businesses and industries. The rate to be applied to multi-family housing units
shall be phased in according to the following schedule:
      January 1, 1996 - $300.00
      May 1, 1998 - $400.00
      November 1, 1999 - $500.00
(Ord. 6-96, passed 4-10-96)
§ 54.17  LINE EXTENSION FEES.
   (A)   Water and sewer lines are normally constructed at the expense of the
private developer. From time to time the city, at its own initiative will
construct line extensions. Line extensions and connections made off lines built
by city employees (excluding replacement lines) will be subject to charges
based upon prorated front foot construction costs or flat rate charges.
   (B)   These construction fees may be negotiated and established by the city
manager generally based on the actual cost of construction. The Council Service
committee shall approve all such fees and charges on a case by case basis.
(Ord. 6-96, passed 4-10-96)
§ 54.18  BILLS AND PAYMENT SCHEDULE.
   (A)   Bills will be mailed or delivered or to the customer at the address of
the premises served, unless the customer shall, in writing, request that they
shall be sent to some other address specified by him/her, but failure to
receive a bill shall not relieve the customer from the obligation to pay the
bill when it is due. Each bill for water and sewer service loses its prompt
payment discount 15 days after the billing date thereof. If a water or sewer
bill remains unpaid until the time the next monthly bill is being generated (30
days after it has been posted) the city shall automatically add a 10% penalty
charge to any bill's remaining outstanding balance at that date. A 15 day
notice of disconnection will be served on the property announcing the shut off
of the service. All water service to delinquent users shall be discontinued
without further notice if the account has not been paid in 45 days from the
posting of the bills, and more than $25 in arrears.
   (B)   The net amount of a customer's bill will be accepted if mailed on or
before the past due date indicated on the bill. The post office date stamped by
the sending office will determine the mailing date of the customers payment.
When payment is made of the net amount after the past due payment date, the
city may credit the amount enclosed to each customer's account and add the
difference between the gross and net bill to the next bill. Such difference
will, however, be subject to the automatic 10% late penalty charge.
   (C)   The past due date of a customers bill will be automatically extended
to include the first full business day following a Saturday, Sunday or a legal
holiday.
   (D)   Bills for water and sewer service (except final bills on
discontinuance of service) may be rendered monthly, and in the case of metered
service shall show the quantity of water used as the billing basis for the
period for which the bill is rendered. Bills for private fire protection
service shall be rendered in advance.
   (E)   In cases in which a meter cannot be read, whatever the cause, the city
may require a payment on account equal to a representative charge for a period
of similar for service rendered to the same premises.
   (F)   A customer desiring water service to be discontinued temporarily to a
premises used or occupied for only part of the year shall so notify the city.
Such premises, save and except public parks, public playgrounds, educational
buildings and facilities and lots or parcels of land being furnished water
service solely for lawn sprinkling or other irrigation purposes, shall, however
remain subject to continuous year-round charges at regular metered rates and
base cost charges.
   (G)   At such time as the city is notified of the change in tenancy or
ownership, requiring the filing of a new application for water service whether
such notice is given by the old customer or otherwise, the city shall make a
final meter reading and shall render a final billing. The customer in whose
name the account stands at the time such final bill is rendered shall be
immediately liable for said final bill. Upon rendering of the final bill, the
service contract shall be terminated. At that time water service may be
physically discontinued to the residence, business, or industrial facilities.
Service to the premises will not be restored until payment of the bill has been
received.
   (H)   Disconnection will occur if the user fails to provide access to the
property served, for the purpose  of installing, reading or  maintaining the
metering  systems, after being  given  notice  and  a reasonable time in which
to comply with such notice. Discontinuance of service under these circumstances
shall be immediate.
(Ord. 6-96, passed 4-10-96)
§ 54.19  PARTIAL PAYMENTS.
   In the event that a customer makes partial payments to the city, the city
reserves the exclusive right to credit that customer's accounts according to
the following priority:
   (A)   Arrears penalty (at any location);
   (B)   Arrears amount (at any location);
   (C)   Sewer charges; and
   (D)   Water charges.
(Ord. 6-96, passed 4-10-96)
§ 54.20  DISHONORED CHECKS.
   (A)   An administrative charge of $25 will be assessed if a check received
as payment for a water or sewer bill is dishonored by the bank.
   (B)   Customers will be required to pay all future bills in cash or
guaranteed finds after receipt of two dishonored checks from that same
customer.
   (C)   Utility services to a customer will be discontinued if a dishonored
check is not corrected within ten days after receipt of a notice from the city
auditor that such condition exists.
(Ord. 6-96, passed 4-10-96)
§ 54.21  RECONNECTION POLICY, FEES AND DEPOSIT.
   (A)   A charge of $25 for reconnection during regular business hours and $75
for reconnection other times than during regular business hours, shall be
required for reconnection water or sewer service that has been disconnected.
Fees charged in this section may be waived due to fire, physical damage, or
other emergency or serious maintenance conditions.
   (B)   If a customer whose service has been disconnected for non-payment of
bills or violation of or failure to comply with the regulations of the city,
desires a reconnection, such reconnection may only be made after the customer
has complied with the following conditions.
      (1)   Has paid all unpaid bills for water and sewer service owed to the
city. It is the clear intention of this provision that all unpaid bills shall
mean the entire bill owed, including the current bill, and any past due amounts
with penalties.
      (2)   Has paid a reconnection fee as set forth in this chapter.
      (3)   In addition to these charges, when a customer has been disconnected
for non-payment, a security deposit of $50 will be required. This deposit will
be held by the city, without interest, until the customer closes the account
and terminates service with the city. This deposit will be applied to the
account as necessary to cover any outstanding bills at the time of termination.
      (4)   Has corrected any condition in violation of the regulations of the
city.
(Ord. 6-96, passed 4-10-96)
§ 54.22  TENANT PAYING FOR WATER AND SEWER SERVICE.
   If the owner of any premises elects to have his tenant, occupant, or lessee
pay the water or sewer charges as they accrue, such occupant, tenant, or lessee
for such purposes acts as the agent of the owner and such owner shall not
thereby be relieved from the payment of any bills or delinquencies that might
occur, and the property shall be subject to the lien provisions as provided
hereafter.
(Ord. 6-96, passed 4-10-96)
§ 54.23  LIEN FOR CHARGES.
   Charges imposed under the terms of this chapter shall constitute a lien upon
the property served, and when delinquent, shall be certified to the County
Auditor on a timetable established by the Auditor's Office, for collection in
the same manner as property taxes. The City Auditor shall be and is hereby
authorized and directed to file sworn statements showing such delinquencies in
the office of the Auditor of Fayette County, and the filing of such statements
shall be deemed notice of the lien of such charges for such service. It shall
be the duty of persons purchasing property to ascertain if there are unpaid
water or sewer charges outstanding against the property. The municipality
reserves the right to discontinue service to the property or to the new owner
until the lien is satisfied.

extending the water system, and for the payment of principal and interest on
any debt incurred in the construction of or replacement or addition to the
water system.
   (B)   Funds received from the sale of sewer and other charges imposed
hereunder shall be deposited into a separate fund and used only for the payment

§ 54.25  GOODWILL ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain
piping and plumbing fixtures in good condition. The amount of water registered
by any meter or otherwise shall be charged and paid for in full irrespective of
whether such water, after having been registered, was lost by leakage,
accident, or otherwise. If such unknown leaks occur, the city auditor or
service director reserves the right to amend, alter, adjust, or fix special
rates in such cases, based upon the facts and circumstances of each case. In
such cases the adjusting personnel shall be guided by the following guidelines:
   (B)   Goodwill adjustment guidelines.
      (1)   Leaks which occur in water lines, not ending up in the sanitary
sewer system.
         (a)   Sewer use will be adjusted to normal use based on the average of
the past six months usage.
         (b)   Twenty-five percent of the water use over the normal usage of
the past six months will be adjusted off the bill.
      (2)   Adjustments may be made for one leak which will not be for longer

(Ord. 6-96, passed 4-10-96)
§ 54.26  OVERCHARGE AND UNDERCHARGE ADJUSTMENT.
   If it is found that the city has directly or indirectly by any device
whatsoever, demanded, charged, collected or received from any customer a
greater or lesser compensation for any service rendered or to be rendered by
the city than that prescribed in the approved rate schedules of the city, or if
it is found that any customer has received or accepted any service from the
city for a compensation greater or lesser than that prescribed in such
schedules, or if; for any reason, billing error has resulted in greater or
lesser charge than that incurred by the customer for the actual service
rendered, then the method of adjustment for such overcharge or undercharge
shall be as provided by the following:
   (A)   If the overcharge or undercharge is the result of a fast or slow
meter, then the method of compensation shall be as follows:
      (1)   In case of a disputed account involving the accuracy of a meter,
such meter shall be tested upon request of the customer, as outlined in this
chapter.
      (2)   In the event that the meter so tested is found to have an error in
registration of more than three percent, the bills will be increased
accordingly, but in no case shall such a correction be made for more than 60
days prior to determination of meter error.
   (B)   If the city has inadvertently overcharged a customer as a result of a
misapplied schedule, an error in reading the meter, a skipped meter reading or
any other human or machine error, except as provided in division (A) of this
section, the city shall, at the customer's option, credit or refund the excess
amount paid by that customer or credit the amount billed by the following:
      (1)   If the interval during which the customer was overcharged can be
determined, then the city shall credit or refund the excess amount charged
during that entire interval provided that the applicable statute of limitations
shall not be exceeded.
      (2)   If the interval during which the customer was overcharged cannot be
determined, then the utility shall credit or refund the excess amount charged
during the six month period preceding the date when the billing error was
discovered.
      (3)   If the exact usage and/or demand incurred by the customer during
the billing periods subject to adjustment cannot be determined, then the refund
shall be based on an appropriate estimated usage and/or demand.
   (C)   If the city has undercharged any customer as a result of a misapplied
schedule, an error in reading the meter, a skipped meter reading, or any human
or machine error, except as provided in division (A) of this section, then the
city may recover the deficient amount as provided as follows:
      (1)   If the interval during which a customer was undercharged can be
determined, then the city may collect the deficient amount incurred during that
interval up to a maximum period of six months.
      (2)   If the interval during which a customer was undercharged cannot be
determined, then the city may collect the deficient amount incurred during the
six month period preceding the date when the billing error was discovered by
the city.
      (3)   The customer shall be allowed to pay the deficient amount in equal
installments added to the regular monthly bills, over the same number of
billing periods which occurred during the interval the customer was subject to
pay the deficient amount.
      (4)   If the usage and/or demand incurred by that person during the
billing periods subject to adjustment cannot be determined, then the adjustment
shall be based on estimated usage and/or demand. If a meter has ceased to
register, the adjustment shall be based on the average registration of the
meter over a six month period when in order.
   (D)   Upon request by a customer, the city shall make a test of the meter
serving them provided that such tests need not be made more frequently than
once in 24 months.
      (1)   The customer, or his representative, may be present when his meter
is tested.
      (2)   The report of the results of the test shall be made to the customer
within a reasonable time after the completion of the test, and a record of the
report, together with a complete record of each test, shall be kept on file at
the office of the city.
   (E)   In the event that the meter so tested is accurate within three
percent, the customer shall pay to the city the reasonable costs for testing
the meter.

cesspools may place the contents of such vaults or cesspools so cleaned in the
city sewer system and appurtenances at a location in such system or
appurtenances to be designated by the City Manager upon compliance with
regulations as established by the City Manager and upon payment into the Sewage
System Revenue Fund a service charge as may be determined by the City Manager
and approved by the Service Committee of City Council. Septic haulers shall not
dump any material into the city sewerage system unless they first obtain a
discharge permit.
(Ord. 6-96, passed 4-10-96)
§ 54.28  SEWER SERVICE CHARGE.
   (A)   The sewer service charge shall be calculated based on the volume of
wastewater discharged directly into the POTW system and shall be measured by
the water used by each sewer user as shown by the water meter readings. The
sewer charge for non-residents of the city, that is, users whose properties
served by the city system is located outside the corporate limits of the city,
shall be the rate established in §
54.03, for city residents plus a surcharge in the amount not to exceed 100% of
the debt service charges set forth in the chart in §
54.03.  The city may, at its option, establish a rate to charge non-residents
of the city, which may be determined on the basis of a flat fee in accordance
with the facts and with equity and justice to the city and such non-resident
users.
   (B)   The sewer service charge will be audited annually by the City Council
to assure that the system is and will continue to be self-sufficient and that
sufficient revenue is being generated from each user class in proper
proportions.
   (C)   The sewer service charge herein assessed shall be in addition to the
charge made for water.
   (D)   The users whose entire water usage is not disposed of through the POTW
system may apply for and be allowed a credit on their bill for water metered at
an external point beyond their water meter that does not enter the POTW system.
A flow meter shall be installed on the external water usage to record the
amount of sewer service credit. The entire cost of this meter and its
installation shall be at the expense of the customer.
   (E)   Where a private water supply is used, the sewer user charge will be
calculated by requiring the property owner to meter the private water supply,
and such metering shall be at the property owner's expense. Such measurement
shall be used in the same manner as a public water meter in determining the
charge. The city may, at its option, in lieu of such metering, apply a sewer
charge established according to §
54.08 of this chapter.  Each residence or separate commercial or industrial
establishment shall be subject to a separate sewer user charge even though such
establishment may be served by a sewer connection common to other premises. If
it is found by the city that the water or waste measured or metered for any
customer is greater than that actually being discharged directly or indirectly
into the sewage system, the city may modify and adjust such volume in
accordance with the facts and with justice and equity, but no charge less than
the minimum shall be made for any customer subject to the sewer charge.
(Ord. 6-96, passed 4-10-96; Am. Ord. 9-2002, passed 4-24-02)
§ 54.29  METER TESTING.
   If any customer requests a meter test the charge for the test shall be $25
for meters up to and including 3/4" in size and at actual cost to the city for
all meters over 3/4" in size. All charges will be paid in advance. The advanced
charge will be refunded only if the meter fails to meet the specifications set
forth in §
54.27.
(Ord. 6-96, passed 4-10-96)
§ 54.30  CONTRACTS FOR WATER AND SEWER SERVICE.
   (A)   All applications for service, written or oral, must state the uses to
which the water is to be applied. A separate application is required for each
meter. Also, a separate application is required for each service line for
private fire protection service. Upon the commencement of service by the city,
the customer becomes obligated to abide by all the terms and provisions of the
city code of ordinances and any lawful amendments, or modifications hereinafter
adopted.
   (B)   When a change of occupancy occurs in any premises receiving water
service, an application by the new occupant must be made to the city. Each
person accepting water service from the city without making proper application
therefore shall be deemed to be a customer for the purpose of all applicable
laws of the city. However the city may terminate such person's service until
proper application is made.
   (C)   Where no notice has been given to the city of a change of occupancy of
a premises, the current occupant shall be liable to the city for the payment of
water service from the billing date next preceding the date of change of
occupancy.
   (D)   No agreement will be made by the city with any applicant for
residential water service until all arrearages and charges due from the
applicant for water service rendered by the city to the applicant at any other
residential premises shall have been paid.
(Ord. 6-96, passed 4-10-96)
§ 54.31  MISCELLANEOUS GENERAL REGULATIONS.
   (A)   When a customer's meter cannot be read for a period exceeding three
months after the latest prior reading, the city may discontinue service to the
customer upon giving a seven days written notice mailed to him of its intention
to do so, unless the customer shall promptly make access to the meter possible

the reading or registration of meters or to the bills rendered must be made at
the city's office, either orally or in writing, and a record of such complaint

§ 70.46  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (A)   All state routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more state routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.  Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on
the basis of an engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are
necessary to stop traffic on a through street or highway for safe and efficient
operation, nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent such
installations.  When circumstances warrant, the Director also may omit stop
signs on roadways intersecting through streets or highways under his
jurisdiction.  Before the director either installs or removes a stop sign under
this division, he shall give notice, in writing, of that proposed action to the
Council or affected local authority at least 30 days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (B)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have “stop” or “yield” signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the municipality may by ordinance designate said street or highway or
portion thereof not to be a through street or highway and thereafter the
affected residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control
devices.  Where two or more streets or highways designated under this division
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (D)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as

      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow

there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (D)   Flashing green signal indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (E)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn

      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a

device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

§ 71.072  OPERATING MOTOR VEHICLE OR MOTORCYCLE WITHOUT VALID LICENSE.
   (A)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under R.C. §§
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the person
has a valid driver’s license issued under R.C. Chapter 4507 or a commercial
driver’s license issued under R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under R.C. §§
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
registrar of motor vehicles under R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be in
the form of an endorsement, as determined by the registrar, upon a driver’s or
commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (B)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to §
130.99 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §
130.99(E) or R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding §
130.99(G)(1)(b)1. and R.C. § 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up to
$1,000; and, notwithstanding §
130.99(F)(1)(c) and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (D)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (E)   If the offender is sentenced under division (C)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender’s license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s
driver license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7).

instead imposes a sentence of not less than 30 consecutive days of house arrest
with electronic monitoring. A period of house arrest with electronic monitoring
imposed under this division shall not exceed six months. If the court imposes a
mandatory three-day jail term under this division, the court may impose a jail
term in addition to that term, provided that in no case shall the cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense exceed six months;
         (b)   A fine of not less than $250 and not more than $1,000;
         (c)   A license suspension under division (E) of this section;

section, the court instead imposes a sentence of not less than 90 consecutive
days of house arrest with electronic monitoring. The period of house arrest
with electronic monitoring shall not exceed one year;
         (b)   Notwithstanding the fines provided for in R.C. Chapter 2929, a

shall be issued and enforced in accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.
      (3)   If, within six years of the offense, the offender previously has

or two or more equivalent offenses, driving under OVI suspension is a
misdemeanor. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
         (a)   A mandatory jail term of 30 consecutive days. Notwithstanding
the jail terms provided in R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, the court may sentence

enforced in accordance with R.C. § 4503.234. If title to a motor vehicle that
is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture under this division is assigned
or transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (3) applies, the court may fine the

distributed in accordance with R.C. § 4503.234(C)(2).
   (C)   (1)   No court shall impose an alternative sentence of house arrest
with electronic monitoring under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that
period.

   (E)   In addition to or independent of all other penalties provided by law
or ordinance, the trial judge of any court of record or the mayor of a mayor’s
court shall impose on an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of this section a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s

driven subject to the privileges, except as provided in R.C. § 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver’s license under this section

a commercial driver’s license under R.C. § 4506.16 shall be issued a driver’s
license under R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the commercial
driver’s license was suspended under this section, and no person whose

driver’s license under R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period of the suspension.
   (F)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial

(A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), form to be read to the person to
be tested, as required under § 73.011, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to
obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission
of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a
law enforcement officer.

pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division © of this section, but the officer shall advise
the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take a
chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the time
of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken at
the person’s own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of this section apply to
the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.

made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement
officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary

blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.

advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the

substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:
      “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
      “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI,
OVUAC, or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
OVI, and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
      “(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
      “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of § 73.012, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the test results
indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a
metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting
officer shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;

the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code. For purposes of this section, the singular shall include the plural, and

income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income;

§ 110.05  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (A)   Collection at source; withholding from qualifying wages.
      (1)   (a)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located
or doing business in the municipality shall withhold from each employee an
amount equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in
the municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under §
110.05(B) or division (A)(4) or (A)(6) of this section. An employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of the employee.
         (b)    In addition to withholding the amounts required under division
(A)(1)(a) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
may also deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the
municipal corporation in which the employee is a resident.
      (2)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (A)(2)(b) or (A)(2)(c) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of
each calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded
$2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the municipality in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200. Payment under division (A)(2)(b) of
this section shall be made so that the payment is received by the Tax

semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted on behalf of the municipality in the preceding
calendar year exceeded $11,999, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and
withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the municipality
in any month of the preceding calendar year exceeded $1,000. The payment under
division (A)(2)(c) of this section shall be made so that they payment is

day after the 15th day of that month;
            2.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld after the 15th day of a month and before the first day of
the immediately following month, the third banking day after the last day of
that month.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under §
110.09(A).
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the tax as required under this
chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other payer's exemption from the
requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator
listing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from
whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator. The city
requires all employers issuing 250 or more W2's in any tax year, to file on
electronic media. Employers filing fewer than 250 W2's are encouraged, but are
not required, to remit W2 forms electronically.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities
are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or
gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the
customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the
customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other
electronic means.
      (11)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.
   (B)   Collection at source; occasional entrant.
      (1)   The following terms as used in this section:
         (a)   "Employer" includes a person that is a related member to or of

         (e)   "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         (f)   "Worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for more than 20
days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not include the home of
an employee.
         (g)   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not

fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
            1.   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (B)(2)(a)1. of this section among those
two or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair
and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            2.   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(B)(2)(b) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for
"municipal corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that
division.
      (2)   (a)   Subject to divisions (B)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in a municipal corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed
such services in the municipal corporation on 20 or fewer days in a calendar
year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
municipality.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed

               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of actual services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than 20 days.
            3.   The employee is a resident of the municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in §
110.05(A).
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the municipality.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (B)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a
municipal corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any
other municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the
amount of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent
performing one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have
been spent at the employee's principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            4.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(b)3. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(2)(a) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (B)(2)(a) of this section, the employer shall withhold
and remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (B)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax
for that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
         (c)   If an employer makes the election described in division (B)(4)
(b) of this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during
those first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
      (5)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
winch the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in §
110.03. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (B)(2)(a) and (B)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of §
110.05(A).
      (7)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on 12 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining. Notwithstanding
division (B)(4) of this section, if, during a calendar year, the number of days
an individual performs personal services at a petroleum refinery exceeds 12,
the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal corporation for the first 12
days for which the employer paid qualifying wages to the individual and for all
subsequent days in the calendar year on which the individual performed services
at the refinery.
   (C)   Collection at source; casino and VLT.
      (1)   The municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in § 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and R.C. §
3772.01, respectively, or a lottery sales agent conducting video lottery
terminals sales on behalf of the state to withhold and remit municipal income
tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as provided in this
section.
      (2)   If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by § 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct and
withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the tax
imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located.

municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
         (b)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any

the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period that information shall be indicated on the annual return.

deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The Administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
         (d)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
         (e)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise
quits the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any
penalties and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor
shall withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
            1.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
            2.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
         (f)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
      (4)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an
amount for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by §
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent
shall deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at
the rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video
lottery terminal facility is located.
      (5)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are
held in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is

         (a)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.

month, the amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld,
and any other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return,
the video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax
Administrator all amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
         (c)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (C)(5) of this section and shall make those
records available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with R.C. § 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
         (d)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with

person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period that information shall be
indicated on the annual return.
         (e)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, a video lottery
sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with respect to
whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income
tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video lottery
sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent shall
provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of each
information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
         (f)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (6)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
      (7)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold
the required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person
from liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
      (8)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:

      (9)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of §
110.07. This division applies only to the person for whom the amount is
deducted and withheld.
      (10)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts
and returns required under this section.

for the municipality is calculated as follows:
      (2)   "Income" reduced by "exempt income" to the extent otherwise
included in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "pre-
2017 net operating loss carryforward" equals "municipal taxable income".
         (a)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "net
profit" of the taxpayer.
            1.   "Net profit" for a person other than an individual is defined
in §
110.03.
            2.   "Adjusted federal taxable income" is defined in §
110.03.
         (b)   "Exempt income" is defined in §

the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used
in this division, tangible personal or real property shall include property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under §
110.05(B);
         (c)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)   If the apportionment factors described in division (B)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipality;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
110.19(A).
         (c)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(2)(a) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by §
110.19(A).
         (d)   Nothing in division (B)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (B)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         (a)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            1.   The employer;
            2.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described
in division (B)(3)(a)2. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
         (b)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (B)(3)(a) or (3)(b) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (B)(1)(c) of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         (a)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
            2.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation
from a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
            3.   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
         (b)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
         (c)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
         (d)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
         (e)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal
corporation in which the property generating the net profit is located and the
municipal corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net
profit resides. A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to
use separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(6)(b) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
         (b)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under §
110.08(A).
      (7)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under the definition of income, division (2) and the definition of
qualifying wages, division (1)(d) of §
110.03, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a
portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt
from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that
municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its
net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other
than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the
amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. This division
applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the amount of a
taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal corporation under
this section.
      (8)   When calculating the ratios described in division (B)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (B)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (C)   Consolidated federal income tax return.
      (1)   As used in this section:
         (a)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in § 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a group
includes at least one incumbent local exchange earner that is primarily engaged
in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this state,
the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange carrier
that would otherwise be included in the group.
         (b)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to § 1501 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
         (c)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (C)
(1)(a) of this section.
         (d)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 4927.01.
         (e)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 5727.01.
      (2)   (a)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
            1.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law;
            2.   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (C)(2)(b) of this section; or
            3.   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
         (b)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (C)(2)(a) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
         (c)   An election made under division (C)(1)(a) or (b) of this section
is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
      (4)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (C)(5)(b), (c), and

taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
         (b)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under the definition of federal
taxable income, of §
110.03 to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to
the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
         (c)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
            1.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
110.06(B), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded,
the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
            2.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
110.06(B), include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included,
the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis
of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (d)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in §
110.06(B), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation;
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make the computations required under §
110.06(B) by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with
this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation
is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of
such an affiliated group.
      (8)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
   (D)   Tax credit for businesses that foster new jobs in Ohio. The
municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit
against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years.
Before the municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.
   (E)   Tax credits to foster job retention. The municipality, by ordinance,
may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit against its tax on income to a
taxpayer for the purpose of fostering job retention in the municipality. If a
credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured as a percentage of
the income tax revenue the municipality derives from the retained employees of
the taxpayer, and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years. Before the
municipality passes an ordinance allowing such a credit, the municipality and
the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of the
credit.

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under §
110.09(A)(7) or on or before the 15th day of the fourth month of the first
taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the 15th day of the sixth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;

installments on or before tire remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month of the year following
that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid with the
return in accordance with §
110.09(A).
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to R.C. § 5747.08(G).
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the 15th day of the fourth month following the end of
the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax

this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:

tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under §

   (F)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is

§ 110.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   (A)   Tax reciprocity. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter
which applies to Ohio Residents and Ohio municipalities only:
      (1)   When an Ohio resident is subject to or has paid, or has
acknowledged a liability for a municipal income tax in another Ohio
municipality on the same income taxable under this chapter and such other Ohio
municipality does not allow a credit to its nonresidents, such resident of the
city may claim a credit in the amount of one-half of the amount of such tax
paid to such tax paid to such other Ohio municipality, but not in excess of
one-half of the tax assessed by this chapter.
      (2)   (a)   When an Ohio resident is subject to and has paid or has
acknowledged liability for a municipal income tax in another Ohio municipality
on the same basis as provided in division (A)(3) of this section, a credit
shall be allowed against the city income tax of 50% of the tax due under the
ordinance of such other Ohio municipality, whichever is the lesser.
         (b)   If the tax due such other Ohio municipality has been paid to or
withheld in such other Ohio municipality, a city resident may claim credit for
and assign to the city any claim for refund to which he may be entitled from
such other Ohio municipality. In the event an amount is not received by the
city equal to such credit claimed by reason of tax payment made to or withheld
in such other Ohio municipality, then the taxpayer shall be liable to the city
for an amount by which the claimed credit exceeds the amount recovered on such
assignment by the city, together with penalty and interest. If satisfactory
evidence is offered, however, the taxpayer is entitled to the claim covered by
assignment, such taxpayer shall be deprived of credit therefore because of
fault or neglect on the part of either Ohio municipality.
         (c)   Assignment of any claim for refund to which an Ohio resident may
be entitled from another municipality shall be tentatively accepted as payment
of that portion of city income tax represented by such assignment. However,
should an overpayment result from the credit allowed by reason of such
assignment, no refund thereof shall be made until such assignment has been
accepted for payment by such other Ohio municipality.
      (3)   (a)   When a Ohio nonresident is subject to the tax imposed by this
chapter and is also subject to tax on the same income in the Ohio municipality
of his residence, a credit of 50% of the tax due under this chapter or 50% of
the tax due under the ordinance of such other Ohio municipality, whichever is
the lesser, shall be allowed against the tax due under this chapter, provided;
            1.   The other Ohio municipality imposes on its residents a tax on
the same income and reciprocal provision is made in the ordinance of such other
Ohio municipality granting to nonresidents thereof a credit on the same basis
as provided in this division against the tax levied thereby;
            2.   Such Ohio nonresident is subject to and has paid, or has
acknowledged liability in the Ohio municipality of his or her residence for any
tax due after such reciprocal credit is allowed; and
            3.   The Ohio municipality of his or her residence furnishes
evidence of payment of tax therein or evidence of assignment by the taxpayer of
his or her claim for reciprocal credit to such other Ohio municipality.
         (b)   The amount due a nonresident as a result of having overpaid the
tax due the city, or arising from allowance of a credit provided for herein
may, under regulations adopted by the Tax Administrator, be assigned and paid
to such other municipality.
      (4)   The credits provided for in divisions (A)(1), (2) and (3) of this
section will not be allowed unless the same are claimed in a timely return or
form acceptable to, and filed with the Tax Administrator. In the event that a
taxpayer fails, neglects or refuses to file such timely return or form he or
she shall not be entitled to such credit and shall be liable for the full
amount of tax assessed by this chapter together with such interest and
penalties, both civil and criminal, as are proscribed in this chapter.
      (5)   Any claim for credit for income taxes paid in another municipality
on the same income taxable hereunder, or claim for assignment of any refund due
to the credit provided for herein, must be filed with the Tax Administrator on
or before December 31 of the year following that for which such credit is
claimed. However, in the event such claim for reciprocity refunds has been
assigned to the municipality of residence, such municipality of residence must
file a claim for refund with the Tax Administrator on or before January 31 next
following such December 31. Failure to file such claim for reciprocity credit
or refund or assignment null and void.
   (B)   Refundable credit for qualifying loss.
      (1)   As used in this section:
         (a)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in § 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)   1.   Except as provided in division (B)(1)(b)2. of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
            2.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid
to one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount
of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (B)(1)(b)1. of this
section computed without regard to division (B)(1)(b)2. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            3.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the
"qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
         (b)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section
from each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more
taxable years.
         (c)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal
corporation with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation
shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate
share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         (d)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   (a)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income
tax that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (b)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (C)   Credit for person working in joint economic development district or
zone. A municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under R.C. §§ 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a
credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to §
110.08(A).
   (D)   Credit for tax beyond statute for obtaining refund.
      (1)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in §
110.09(F).
      (2)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in §
110.09(F), the municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
municipality claims is due. If the municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
      (3)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in §
110.09(F).
      (4)   Nothing in this section requires a municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section110.08(A)
regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall

      (4)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary

         (d)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual
net profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some
other manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to
the Tax Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is

         (e)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (A)(6)
of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic
form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (f)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be

      (7)   (a)   1.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under R.C. §

            3.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed
by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is $10 or less.
         (b)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the municipality in accordance with
this chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and
make payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers
not otherwise required to file annual returns.
         (c)   With respect to taxpayers to whom §
110.09(B) applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in §
110.09(B), the provision in §
110.09(B) prevails.
      (8)   (a)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the municipality
shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the
amount due is $10 or less.
         (b)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (A)(8)(a) of this section shall file with the
municipality an annual net profit return under division (A)(6)(c) and (d) of

      (9)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
§
110.05(A)(2)(a)2. or (a)3.
         (a)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (b)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to
an account designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments,
except that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
      (10)   The amounts withheld for the municipality by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer as described in §
110.05(A) shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the municipality and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
      (11)   Each return required by the municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
      (12)   The Tax Administrator of the municipality shall accept for filing
a generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
      (13)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
      (14)   (a)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in §
110.05(B).
         (b)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the
municipal corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the
person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal
corporation, and the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and
remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this
chapter. The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a
taxpayer who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year. The person shall provide the notice in a
signed affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including
the location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the
person performed services or made any sales within the municipal corporation.
The affidavit also shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no
plans to perform any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales
in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by
the municipal corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a
taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by
the municipal corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
            3.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (A)(14)
(b) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file
any tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (A)(14) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from
performing an audit of the person.
   (B)   Return and payment of tax; individuals serving in combat zone.
      (1)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An
applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers
necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 180st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. Except as provided in division (B)(2)(c) of this section,
the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as the Tax
Administrator considers appropriate.
         (b)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the municipality before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
         (c)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division
(B)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not
require any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes
for the extension period.
      (3)   (a)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in
this division the application of divisions (A)(1) and (2) of this section.
         (b)   1.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (B)(3)(b)1. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
            2.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (B)(3)(b)1. of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (B)(3)(b)1. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
      (4)   For each taxable year to which division (B)(1), (2), or (3) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2)(b) and (2)(c)
or (B)(3) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer
if the filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly
for that year.
   (C)   Use of Ohio business gateway; types of filings authorized.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
      (4)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
      (5)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
   (D)   Extension of time to file.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for
a period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
      (3)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (4)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
      (5)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under R.C. § 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
   (E)   Amended returns.
      (1)   (a)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
         (b)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is $10 or less.
         (c)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
      (2)   (a)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as provided
under division (E)(2)(b) of this section, the amended return shall not reopen
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed
return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment
to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the applicable
statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under §
110.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.
         (b)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
      (3)   (a)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by §
110.19(E)(1)(b) for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is $10 or less, no refund need be
paid by the municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in division (E)
(3)(b) of this section, a request filed under this division shall claim refund
of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
110.09(F). Except as set forth in division (E)(3)(b) of this section, the
request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
         (b)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (F)   Refunds.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of
the municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the municipality:
         (a)   Overpayments of more than $10;
         (b)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds $10.
      (2)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
         (b)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (F)
(2)(c) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
         (c)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
110.18.
      (3)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for
filing specified in division (F)(2) of this section shall be considered to have
been filed in a timely manner if any of the following
situations exist:
         (a)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
         (b)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only
postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is received within seven days of such last
day.
         (c)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
      (4)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall he allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
110.10(A)(4).
      (5)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as
in §
110.10.

and functions necessary and appropriate to implement the provisions of this
chapter, including without limitation:
      (1)   Exercise all powers whatsoever of an inquisitorial nature as

bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax
Administrator's findings, and, if the Tax Administrator finds that there has
been an overpayment, approve and issue a refund payable to the taxpayer, the
taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this chapter;
      (5)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to

      (6)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of

and orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator's own
motion, review, redetermine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,
determination, computation, assessment or order which the Tax Administrator has
made for which an appeal has been filed with the Local Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in §
110.05(A).
   (B)   Authority of Tax Administrator; compromise of claim and payment over
time.
      (1)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount
payable to the municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax
imposed in accordance with this chapter.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the municipality:
         (a)   Compromise a claim;
         (b)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim
by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
      (4)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
      (5)   (a)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
         (b)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
      (6)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide
detailed financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether
or not a payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure
to provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator
shall preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
   (C)   Authority of Tax Administrator; right to examine.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
   (D)   Authority of Tax Administrator; requiring identifying information.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to §
110.10, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §
110.99.
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (D)(1) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to §
110.10.
         (c)   The penalties provided for under divisions (D)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in §
110.99 for a violation of §
110.15 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator

state law, or the municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts

   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of §
110.15.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the

of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.

§ 110.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in R.C. § 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a

mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.

collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal

involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the municipality shall be two years. There is no

administrative official of the municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in R.C. §

qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and

unable to serve.

compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the Board.

appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of
tills section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may

certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the

of the parties to the appeal within 15 days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in R.C. § 5717.011.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to tins section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under R.C. § 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to R.C. § 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.

assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under §

CHAPTER 118:  TOW SERVICE
Sections
   
118.01   Tow service policy
§ 118.01  TOW SERVICE POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose.  The purpose of this policy is to provide a documented call
system to provide reliable and efficient service to the Police Department and
citizens when towing services are required.  All tow services are required to
complete an application before being placed or considered for placement in
wrecker rotation. A copy of the policy will be provided with the application.
   (B)   (1)   Tow companies are required to attach proof of insurance to the
initial application. On an annual basis thereafter, tow companies will be
required to provide the Police Department with proof of insurance. The
certificate of insurance will include liability coverage for towing of vehicles
and garage keepers’ coverage for the care and custody of towed or impounded
vehicles. This required coverage must be kept current and proof provided to the
department.
      (2)   Each tow company shall maintain a relatively secure impound area.
Such location is subject to inspection of the premises and vehicles by Police
Department representatives.
      (3)   Each tow service must provide a 24-hour wrecker service and provide
24-hour phone numbers to ensure a prompt response to a call for service.
      (4)   Each tow service must be able to respond in a reasonable amount of
time. The Chief of Police or a designee may decide what is a reasonable amount
of time. Distance, traffic conditions, and the like will be considered in that
determination.
      (5)   Wrecker rotation will be computer generated by the Police
Department’s computer aided dispatch system to maintain documentation. Towing
services are not given any right to calls by this policy. The department may
change the documentation process to keep current with available technology.
      (6)   The tow company shall provide a list of equipment and services they
have available to provide. This list shall be updated by the tow service when
necessary or when an update is requested.
      (7)   Specific tow service company requests by citizens will be
documented as owner requests and not considered a rotation call. This will
apply when no police incident is involved. An example of this would be when a
car is broken down and the owner contacts an officer or the department and
requests a specific wrecker service and the contact is a courtesy effort by
police personnel.
   (C)   The City Manager, for any legitimate reason, may remove tow service
companies from the department wrecker list. This removal will be documented in
correspondence to the tow service being removed. The following, while not being
all-inclusive, is a list of possible reasons for removal from the list:
      (1)   Violation of law;
      (2)   Refusing calls;
      (3)   Failing to respond after accepting a call;
      (4)   Delayed response to service calls;
      (5)   Failure to properly clean debris, including liquid spills such as
oil, fuel, and anti-freeze;
      (6)   Failure to maintain adequate impound areas;
      (7)   Failure to provide current proof of insurance;
      (8)   Releasing vehicles without proper authorization from the Police
Department;
      (9)   Failure to charge reasonable or prevailing rates for towing or
roadside services;
      (10)   Jumping wrecker calls;
      (11)   Towing a vehicle from a crash scene without contacting the
department to respond;
      (12)   Making consistent unfounded complaints to the Chief of Police or
designee.

§ 130.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   For the purpose of this section:
      (1)   POSSESSION is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended his possession.
      (2)   INVOLUNTARY ACTS are reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition.
      (3)   CULPABILITY means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in §
130.08. 
      (4)   INTOXICATION includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
(R.C. § 2901.21)  (‘73 Code, § 501.07)
§ 130.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22) (‘73 Code, § 501.08)
§ 130.09  ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct which, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense which was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of such offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented its
commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02)  (‘73 Code, § 501.09)  Penalty, see §
130.99
§ 130.10  COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of §
130.09.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
      “The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of
his complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
      It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth.”
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(R.C. § 2923.03)  (‘73 Code, § 501.10)  Penalty, see §
130.99
§ 130.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   For the purpose of this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for
profit or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23)  (‘73 Code, § 501.11)
§ 130.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in §
130.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24)  (‘73 Code, § 501.12)
§ 130.13  SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE and VEHICLE have the same meanings
as in R.C. § 2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person who lawfully is in that person’s residence has no duty to
retreat before using force in self defense, defense of another, or defense of
that person’s residence, and a person who lawfully is an occupant of that
person’s vehicle or who lawfully is an occupant in a vehicle owned by an
immediate family member of the person has no duty to retreat before using force
in self defense or defense of another.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 130.99  PENALTY.
   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body of the
section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall be deemed
a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $500,
imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) to (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in R.C. §§ 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5)
or (C)(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized
pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender
for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section.  The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, also
is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type described
in R.C. § 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the offender for
the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender an additional
definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional jail term shall
not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Revised Code. The offender
shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and prior to the jail
term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to any other
mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
2012 S-16
      (6)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(6)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(6)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(6)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) or
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a
jail term is required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor,
other than a minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the
following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated
the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E).  Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division.  Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to  500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;
         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours. 
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G). If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim’s economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on
restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of
restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the
victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               A.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021;
               B.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               C.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the
treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (G), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.A. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.B.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(4) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.11 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
         (e)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(R.C. § 2929.31)  (‘73 Code, § 501.99)
   (I)   In such cases where no penalty section exists in the city code, but
there is a corresponding section of the Ohio Revised Code for which a penalty
clause exists, then the penalty assessed for that violation by the Ohio Revised
Code shall apply.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 131.01  ARSON.
   (A)   (1)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of division (B)(1)
or (C)(1) of this section.
         (a)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item,
antique, museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing which is
either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial
time, effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount which would compensate the owner for its loss.
         (b)   If the property is not covered under division (A)(1)(a) hereof,
and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially
to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
         (c)   If the property is not covered under division (A)(1)(a) hereof,
and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
      (2)   For the purpose of this section, FAIR MARKET VALUE has the same
meaning as defined in §
131.26(C)(3).
      (3)   Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in §

the following:

(R.C. §§ 2909.01, 2913.01)  (‘73 Code, § 545.01)
§ 131.26  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (A)   When a person is charged with a theft offense, or with a violation
R.C. § 1716.14(A)(1) involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled
adult that involves property or services valued at $500 or more, property or
services valued at $500 or more and less than $5,000, property or services
valued at $5,000 or more and less than $25,000, property or services valued at
$25,000 or more and less than $100,000, or property or services valued at
$100,000 or more, the jury or court trying the accused shall determine the
value of the property or services as of the time of the offense and, if a
guilty verdict is returned, shall return the finding of value as part of the
verdict. In any case in which the jury or court determines that the value of
the property or services at the time of the offense was $500 or more, it is
unnecessary to find and return the exact value, and it is sufficient if the 
finding and return is to the effect that the value of the property or services
involved was $500 or more and less than $5,000, was $5,000 or more and less
than $25,000, was $25,000 or more and less than $100,000, or was $100,000 or
more.
   (B)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of R.C. § 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by division (A) of this section, is the
aggregate value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (C)   (1)   When a series of offenses under §
131.29, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716,14(A), R.C.
§ 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled
adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these
offenses, is committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment,
capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a
single offense.  When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by division (A)
of this section is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in
all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant
to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a
single offense.  If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the
property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in
the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (C)(1), (C)(2) or
(C)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (C)
(1) or (C)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (C)(2) of this section.  While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (C)(1), (C)(2), or (C)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (D)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (D)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (D)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, FAIR
MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (E)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

to the manager and to the owner, if different, of the real estate of which the
commercial establishment is a part, or to the occupant, lessee, agent, or
tenant and to the owner, if different, of the real estate of which the
residence is a part, indicating that failure to pay the bill within 30 days, or

transaction scan device does not excuse a seller or an agent or employee of a
seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:

The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that
characterize a property shall be avoided.
   (C)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historic development, such
as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings,
shall not be undertaken.
   (D)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
   (E)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques examples
of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved.
   (F)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced.

other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing,
features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial
evidence.

shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing,
size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of
the property and its environments.
   (J)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, § 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the legal
authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the health,
safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City Council of the
City of Washington Court House, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 5-2015, passed 4-22-15)
§ 152.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The city has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 5-2015, passed 4-22-15)
§ 152.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 5-2015, passed 4-22-15)
§ 152.04  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 5-2015, passed 4-22-15)
§ 152.05  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the city as identified in §
152.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by city.
(Ord. 5-2015, passed 4-22-15)
§ 152.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (A)   Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance Study Number
39047C, Community Number 390166 and associated map Flood Insurance Study
Fayette County and Incorporated Areas, with associated Flood Insurance Rate
Map, dated March 2, 2004.
   (B)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Washington Court House as required by §
152.43, Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   (C)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the City of Washington Court House, 105 North
Main Street, Washington Court House, Ohio.
(Ord. 5-2015, passed 4-22-15)
§ 152.07  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
(resolutions) including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In
the event of a conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance
(resolution), the more restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall
not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to
such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 5-2015, passed 4-22-15)
§ 152.08  INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 5-2015, passed 4-22-15)
§ 152.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Washington Court House,
any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 5-2015, passed 4-22-15)
§ 152.10  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.

given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1% chance annual
flood or 100-year flood.
   BASE (100-YEAR) FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevation of the
base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one
to three feet).
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ENCLOSURE BELOW THE LOWEST FLOOR. See LOWEST FLOOR.
   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT). Issued by President Carter in
1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in
or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless
there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA). The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      ZONE A. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
      ZONES A1-30 AND ZONE AE. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      ZONE AO. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
      ZONE AH. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      ZONE A99. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      ZONE B AND ZONE X (SHADED). Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the
100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with contributing
drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
      ZONE C AND ZONE X (UNSHADED). Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the
base flood elevation plus one foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or
approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   FLOODWAY. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood, discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Washington Court House's historic preservation program, which
program is certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA
determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are
broken down into the following categories:
      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data that,
usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations,
floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type
of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel
has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore,
excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and comment
by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National
Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in R.C. Ch. 3781.06.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-
27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three or
more manufactured homes, used for habitation-are parked, either free of charge
or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The NFIP is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced
on or after the initial effective date of adoption of these regulations,
Ordinance No. 5-2015 of the City of Washington Court House.
   PERSON. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the R.C. § 111.15 as
any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or any
court.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. §§ 4703.01 to 4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer under R.C. Ch. 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor under R.C. Ch. 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD, it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in
any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance
Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer
to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal, state or local
sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction;"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (A)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood

applicant:
         (a)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
152.29(A);
         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         (d)   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         (e)   Concurrence of the City Manager and the Chief Executive Officer
of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (B)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         (b)   Division (A)(2), items (a) and (c) through (e).
   (C)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the
flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain Administrator
may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the city
specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required, it
shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
152.29(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The City Planning Commission acting as the Appeals Board shall have
the power to authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of
these regulations, not inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot
or parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
   (A)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to

evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         (f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.

flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         (d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         (e)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the City Planning Commission acting as the Appeals Board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of these regulations.
   (D)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in division (C)(1)(a) to (k) have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

personal hygiene.
      (2)   All other structures for human occupancy or use on premises
abutting on a sewer or with a private sewage disposal system shall have
adequate sanitary facilities, but in no case less than one water closet and one
other fixture for cleaning purposes.

unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding, drainage, topography,
street layout and traffic patterns, inadequate utilities, and other such
conditions which may endanger health, life, or property; and, if from
investigations conducted by the public agencies concerned, it is determined
that in the best interest of the public the land should not be developed for
the purpose proposed, the Commission shall not approve the land for subdivision
unless adequate methods are advanced by the subdivider for solving the problems
that will be created by the development of the land.  (Ord. 20-89, passed 6-28-

be permitted. Steps shall be drop-front design with minimum tread width of nine
inches.  Rubber-covered “Wedglok” manhole steps may be used in lieu of the
above.
         (d)   Granular materials.  Granular materials furnished for
foundation, bedding, encasement or other purposes shall consist of any material
or synthetic mineral aggregate such as sand, gravel, crushed rock, crushed
stone or slag, that shall be so graded as to meet the gradation requirements
specified herein for each particular use.
         (e)   Select backfill.  Job excavated select backfill material shall
be free from debris, organic material, and stones larger than three inches in
diameter.
      (2)   Alignment and grades.
         (a)   All roadways shall be constructed in accordance with lines and
grades shown on the approved drawings.
         (b)   The developer shall provide an experienced instrument man,
competent assistants and such instruments, tools, stakes, and other materials
required to complete the survey, layout, and measurement work.
         (c)   Any work done without being properly located may be ordered
removed and replaced at the developer's expense.
      (3)   Detour - traffic control - temporary crossings and barricades.
         (a)   Traffic will be permitted to use the street at all times, unless
a detour is specifically permitted on the drawings or by the city.  Safe access
to all abutting residences and properties shall be maintained to the maximum
extent possible.
         (b)   The developer shall construct and maintain temporary crossings,
complete with flaggers, whenever necessary to expedite the work or to maintain
traffic.  Temporary crossings shall be of ample size to safely carry the load
which comes upon them.  The Developer shall furnish sufficient signs and
barricades to facilitate the directing of traffic.
      (4)   Laying of pipe.
         (a)   All foreign matter or dirt shall be removed from the inside of
the pipe before it is lowered into its position in the trench, and it shall be
kept clean by approved means during and after laying.  All openings along the
line of the sewer shall be securely closed as directed and, in the suspension
of work at any tie, suitable watertight stoppers shall be placed to prevent
earth, water or other substances from entering the sewer.
         (b)   Piping shall be laid to the lines and grades indicated on the
drawings.
         (c)   Fine grading to the bottom of the barrel shall proceed ahead of
the pipe laying and, should any over-excavation exceeding two inches be
encountered, the material added shall be moistened and compacted to the
satisfaction of the Engineer or foundation material shall be added.
         (d)   Holes shall be dug for the pipe bells and the material placed
along the preceding pipe laid.  The pipe shall be supported for the bottom 90°
and throughout its length (except for the minimum distance necessary at the
bell holes) as shown on the drawings.  Bell holes shall be adequate to make the
joint, but no larger than necessary so that maximum support on undisturbed
ground will be provided for  the pipe.  The remainder of  the pipe shall be 
surrounded to at least  the mid-point of the  pipe by granular bedding, shovel
placed and hand stamped, to fill completely all spaces under and adjacent to
the pipe.  Non-granular materials must be used for PVC pipe.
         (e)   Pipe laying should proceed upgrade with the spigot ends pointed
in the direction of flow.  No pipe shall be laid in water or when the trench
conditions are unsuitable for such work.  The Developer shall make all
connections of pipe to the manholes which have previously been constructed.
         (f)   When connecting to existing sewers, the developer shall take
every precaution necessary to prevent dirt or debris from entering the existing
lines.  The developer shall use an approved watertight plug to securely plug
the new sewer at the connection to the existing sewer immediately after the
connection has been made.  The plug shall be braced as necessary and tied to
the manhole by a rope or chain.  This plug shall remain until the new sewer
system has been accepted by the city.
      (5)   Construction of manholes.
         (a)   Excavation shall be to a depth and size to provide for
construction of the manhole as shown in detail on the drawings.
         (b)   Concrete bases shall be poured on undisturbed ground.  Precast
concrete bases shall be carefully lowered onto six inches minimum layer of well
compacted sand accurately laid to a smooth level surface using a straight edge
and hand level or three inches of concrete poured on undisturbed soil.
         (c)   Walls shall be of precast concrete as shown on the drawings and
shall be constructed to form a complete watertight structure.
         (d)   Provide a minimum of six inches and a maximum of 18 inches in
two-inch layers of sewer brick or precast concrete adjusting rings between the
cast iron frame and the manhole tope section.  Each ring or brick shall be set
on a full bed of mortar and shall be made watertight. Wood or other foreign
material will not be allowed.  Adjusting rings shall conform to the size and
shape of the casting frame.  Frames and covers shall be set to the designated
elevation in a full mortar bed.
         (e)   On streets that are not at design grade, sewer manholes shall be
built with such additional adjusting rings or short manhole sections as
necessary to allow for adjustment of the street to the proposed grade as shown
on the drawings.  Manhole casting tops shall be ¼-inch below the street
surfacing.
         (f)   When manholes are to be constructed in new streets, manhole
rings shall be set to final grade before street wearing course is laid.  In
unpaved roadways, the manhole ring shall be brought to grade and surrounded by
a three-inch thick asphalt apron at least five feet in diameter.
         (g)   The bottom of all manholes shall be smoothly shaped to conform
to the pipe so as to allow a free, uninterrupted flow of sanitary sewage.
         (h)   Unless shown otherwise on the drawings, the sanitary sewer pipe
should be laid continuously through the manholes and broken or cut out when the
manhole base is finished.  Manhole couplings or rubber ring stops must be used
where the pipe joins the manholes.
      (6)   Backfilling and grading.
         (a)   All excavation in trenches shall be backfilled to the original
ground surface or to such grades as specified or shown on the drawings.  The
backfill shall begin as soon as practical after the pipe has been placed and
shall thereafter be carried on as rapidly as the protection of the balance of
the work shall permit.
         (b)   Backfilling and compacting shall be done as thoroughly as
possible so as to prevent after-settlement.  Depositing of the backfill shall
be done so the impact of falling material will not injure the pipe or
structures.
         (c)   Granular bedding shall be deposited in the trench simultaneously
on both sides of the pipe for the full width of the trench to a height at least
to the mid-point of the pipe, shovel placed, and hand stamped to fill
completely all spaces under and adjacent to the pipe.  Encasement material will
then be placed around and over the pipe to a height of at least 12 inches above
the top of the pipe but need not be hand placed.  Nongranular materials may be
used for encasement except for PVC pipe.
         (d)   In the event that natural, suitable, granular material is not
encountered during the normal excavation of the sewer trench, or when the
material encountered is determined unsuitable by the city for encasement around
the pipe as required, the developer shall provide and place such approved
material.  For PVC pipe, approved granular encasement material must be placed
and hand stamped to at least six inches over the top of the pipe.  The
remaining six inches may be nongranular material if specifically approved by
the city.
         (e)   Succeeding layers of backfill above the 12-inch level may
contain coarse materials not exceeding three inches in the largest dimension,
but shall be free from large pieces of rock, frozen material, concrete, roots,
stumps, tin cans, rubbish, and other similar articles whose presence in the
backfill would cause settlement of the trench or damage to the pipe.
         (f)   Whenever select material that exists in place in the upper four
feet of the finished grade of the paved or traveled portions of the street or
roadway, is removed by the trench excavation, the contractor shall replace the
material (or material of equal quality) as backfill in the upper four feet of
the finished grade.  Where select material does not exist in place as described
above, provide and place sufficient select backfill to stabilize the finished
grade.
         (g)   Backfilling shall be done in lifts of uniform layers which will
produce the required compaction.  Each lift shall be completely compacted over
the full-width of the excavated area. Compacting shall continue until the
specified relative compaction has been attained or until no more settlement
occurs.  Water jetting of backfill shall not be permitted.
         (h)   Special compaction shall be performed around all manholes, valve
boxes, curb boxes, other structures, and utilities by the use of pneumatic
tampers, plate tampers, or plate vibrators.
         (i)   Sewer service trenches in the right-of-way must be compacted in
the same manner as the main trenches.  In streets open to traffic, service
trenches must not be left open overnight.  In areas where curb and gutter
exist, sufficient curbing shall be removed to allow this compaction over the
entire disturbed area.
         (j)   The relative compaction of the soils in place shall be
determined by using either the sand-cone method ASTM Standard Test Designation
D1556-64, or nuclear methods, ASTM Standard Test Designation D2922-71. 
Relative compaction of all backfill materials must meet the following
requirements as determined by AASHO T-99 (ASTM D-698) method A or C.  The
compaction required in paved areas, areas to be paved, or graveled areas shall
be as follows:
         (k)   Ninety-five percent compaction from 24 inches above top of pipe
to the finished surface, except that in no case shall this 95% compaction zone
be less than 48 inches deep.  Ninety percent compaction from pipe zone to start
of 95% compaction zone.
         (l)   The compaction required outside paved areas, outside areas to be
paved or outside graveled areas shall be 90%.
         (m)   The developer is responsible for the complete maintenance of his
work at all times.
         (n)   The contractor shall remedy at his own expense any defects that
appear in the backfill following completion and during the one-year guarantee
period.
      (7)   Service connections.
         (a)   It shall be the duty of the developer to keep an accurate record
of service connections as to the location, elevation of the service at the
property line, type of connection provided, and the like. Location shall be
made in respect to the survey line stationing and house corners or lot corners.
All services must be approved by the inspector prior to backfill.
         (b)   Generally, a four-inch or six-inch wye shall be used in the main
line.  An approved adaptor or other approved method of connection to the wye
shall be installed.
         (c)   All house connections shall be capped with stoppers recommended
by the pipe manufacturer, sealed firmly in place, or by other methods accepted
by the Engineer, which shall effectively prevent water from entering the sewer
until the connection is placed in service.  The house connection end shall be
clearly marked by a rebar extending from the pipe end to at least three feet
above the ground.
         (d)   Risers are to be constructed at all points where the depth of
cover over the invert of the sewer line is 15 feet or more at other locations
as determined by the Engineer.
      (8)   Testing - sanitary sewer.
         (a)   Upon completion of all utility construction by this contract and
before any house services are connected, tests will be required of all sanitary
sewer lines.
         (b)   The contractor has the option of performing either an air test
or an exfiltration test.
Test shall be performed after complete compaction and backfill and completion
of manholes, but may be performed before paving.
            1.   Air tests.
               A.   The contractor shall perform these tests with suitable
equipment specifically designed for air testing sewers.
               B.   The air test shall be made when the sewer is clean. 
Sections of sewer pipe to be tested, may be wetted before the air test.  The
line shall be plugged at each manhole with pneumatic balls.  Low pressure air
shall be introduced into the plugged line until the internal pressure reaches
(4.0) psig greater than the average back pressure of any ground water pressure
that may submerge the pipe.  At least two minutes shall be allowed for the air
temperature to stabilize before readings are taken and the time started.
               C.   The portion being tested shall pass if it does not lose air
at a rate to cause the pressure to drop from 3.6 to 3.0 psig (greater than the
average back pressure of any ground water that may submerge the pipe) in less
time than listed below.
 
Pipe Diameter in Inches Minimum Allowable Minutes
                        3.6 - 3.0 psig Pressure
4  2.0
6  3.0
8  4.0
10 5.0
12 6.0
15 7.5
18 9.0
21 10.5
24 12.0
 
               D.   If the installation fails this test, the testing equipment
may be used to determine the location of the pipe leak.
               E.   All service plugs shall be secured in place to prevent
displacement during testing operations.
            2.   Exfiltration test.
               A.   In lieu of the standard sanitary sewer air test, the
contractor may make exfiltration tests on sewers.
               B.   The test section shall be bulkheaded at both ends and the
pipe subjected to a hydrostatic pressure produced by a head of water at a depth
of three feet above the top of the sewer at the upper manhole under test.  In
areas where ground water exists, this head of water shall be three feet above
the existing water table.
            3.   A.   The head of water shall be obtained by means of an open
ended standpipe projecting from test plug on upper manhole.  Placing water in
the upper manhole is not permissible as a means of obtaining the necessary
pressure head of water.
               B.   This head of water shall be maintained for a period of one
hour during which it is presumed that full absorption of the pipe body has
taken place, and thereafter for a further period of one hour for the actual
test of leakage.  During this one hour test period, the measured maximum
allowable rate of exfiltration for any section of sewer, including service
stubs, shall be as listed below:
 
Main Sewer Diameter in Inches Maximum Allowable Exfiltration Gallons Per Hour
                              Per 100 Feet
4             0.6
6             0.9
8             1.2
10            1.5
12            1.9
15            2.3
18            2.8
21            3.3
24 and larger 3.8
 
               C.   In case measurements indicate an exfiltration greater than
the maximum allowable leakage, additional measurements shall be taken and
continued until all leads are located and the necessary repairs and corrective
work have reduced the leakage in the section being tested below the maximum
allowable by the specifications.  For purposes of the test, the line between
adjoining manholes will be considered a section and will be tested as such.
               D.   The introduction of any substance into the water used for
testing with the intent of sealing such leaks as may be indicated will not be
permitted.
               E.   If results of either of these tests are not satisfactory,
repairs or pipe replacement will be required until the Engineer is satisfied
that the leakage requirements are being met. All repair methods and materials
used must be accepted by the Engineer.
      (9)   PVC deflection test.
         (a)   All PVC pipe shall be subject to a deflection test by use of
cage type approved mandrel.
         (b)   In paved areas or areas to be paved, either:
            1.   Testing PVC sewer lines with a 4% deflection mandrel after
complete backfill and compaction of trench but before paving; or
            2.   Testing PVC sewer lines with a 5% deflection mandrel after
paving is complete.
         (c)   In non-paved areas contractor has the option of:
            1.   Testing PVC sewer lines with a 4% deflection mandrel after
complete backfill and compaction of trench but before placing and spreading top
soil; or
            2.   Testing PVC sewer lines with a 5% deflection mandrel after
placing and spreading top soil (but before seeding).
         (d)   All mandrels shall be precisely made to the diameters specified
below (which include allowances for pipe manufacturer's outside diameter
tolerance, excess wall thickness tolerance, and out-of-roundness tolerance).
 
Nominal Pipe Diameter Mandrel Minimum O.D. for 4% Mandrel Minimum O.D. for 5%
                      Deflection                  Deflection
4"                    —                         —
6"                    —                         —
 
      (10)   Video tape.  Following the construction of all sanitary sewer
mains in the city, in addition to holding a pressure test as required by this
code, the city will be given a tape of the televising of the lines as they have
been constructed in place. This tape shall be of the size, quality and
specification that it can be played and monitored on the existing video
equipment owned by the city.
   (B)   Where a public sanitary sewer system is not reasonably accessible, the
subdivider may provide:
      (1)   A central treatment plant for the group, provided that such central
treatment plant is installed in accordance with regulations requirements of the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency; or
      (2)   Lots may be served by individual disposal systems if the provisions
of this section are met.
   (C)   (1)   Where the installation of individual disposal systems is
considered, the suitability of the soil for individual systems, the absorptive
ability of the soil, surface drainage, ground water level, and topography shall
be the criteria for determining whether or not the installation of individual
systems is permissible.  Criteria shall be in accordance with the requirements
of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
      (2)   Each lot so served shall be of a size and shape to accommodate the
necessary length of field tile at a safe distance from and at a lower elevation
than the proposed building(s).  Such lot size and shape shall conform to the
requirements of the zoning district in which they are located.  If no zoning is
in effect, the standards set forth in §
155.048 shall be met.
      (3)   At least one percolation test shall be made for each lot area being
platted, and each test shall be located in close proximity to the proposed
individual sewage disposal unit, be numbered and its location shown on the
preliminary plat.  All percolation tests shall be performed in accordance with
the requirements of the City Planning Commission and the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency.
      (4)   Where the installation of individual disposal units is considered
and where the average natural ground slope exceeds 10%, the installation of a
step-up disposal system may be required subject to specification by the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency.

§ 155.084  DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   The subdivider shall construct all necessary facilities including
underground pipe, inlets, catch basins, or open drainage ditches, to provide
for the adequate disposal of subsurface and surface water and maintenance of
natural drainage courses. The velocity of flow in an open ditch shall not
exceed two feet per second in soil ditches or five feet per second in turf
gutters. Paved gutters will be required if velocities of flow are greater than
those specified or if it is otherwise likely that destructive erosion will
result. Drainage ditches shall not be permitted to discharge into any sanitary
sewer facility.
   (B)   All stormwater drainage facilities within a development shall be
designed to have capacity for the total tributary area, at the design storm
frequency, and based on the rate of single family, residential runoff.
   (C)   All proposed development with a runoff rate greater than that which
the downstream system is, or will be designed for, will be required to control
the rate of stormwater discharge.
   (D)   All developments having existing controls located downstream from the
site, will be required to control the discharge flow rate of stormwater to that
rate which existed prior to development.
   (E)   If the decision is made by the city to handle stormwater runoff by
storage in a detention or retention facility, the facility will be transferred
to the city by deed with a reverter clause to developer if no longer used as a
water storage facility. However, the developer will be required to maintain the
facility for two years after approval or acceptance by the city.
   (F)   All land developers wishing to develop in the city are required to
prepare and submit a Master Drainage Plan for the total development area. The
Master Drainage Plan shall include:
      (1)   A topographic contour map, with the drainage area delineated, with
a plan for draining the total upstream tributary watershed through the proposed
development.
      (2)   A topographic map with at least two-foot contours, with general
layout of the proposed inlets and storm sewers for the total development
showing all existing drainage structure with size and invert elevations.
      (3)   The capacity of the downstream open channel, culvert or storm sewer
that may be used for an outlet.
      (4)   The points downstream that may be used as a control to determine
the maximum allowable rate of stormwater runoff for the design storm.  Existing
culverts are not necessarily controls.
      (5)   The routing path to be provided for runoff in the event the
drainage facilities' capacity is exceeded.  This path will become part of a
grading plan which will be submitted with detail plans.
      (6)   A routing of excess stormwater through the site discharge to off-
site lands.  The routing path shall be continuous from one development to the
next.
      (7)   If a decision is made to handle stormwater runoff by storage and
releasing it at a regulated rate to prevent flooding downstream, the storage
basin will be located in and become part of the routing path.
      (8)   Excess stormwater will be kept out of proposed habitable
structures.
      (9)   The Master Drainage Plan shall be approved by the city prior to the
developer initiating detail engineering designs.
   (G)   The rational method can be used to determine the peak rate of runoff
for all design storms for drainage areas of 200 acres or less.

§ 155.085  STORM SEWERS AND STORM WATER DRAINAGE.
   (A)   Where an adequate public storm sewer is available at the plat
boundary, the subdivider shall construct a storm sewer system and connect with
storm sewer line. If such a storm sewer system is not accessible, closed
conduit or natural drainage channels with easements of adequate width shall be
provided, as determined by the city and approved by the City Planning
Commission. Paved ditch gutters or storm sewers shall be required if velocities
of flow are greater than specified in §
155.084 or cause destructive erosion. Storm drainage including surface water,
groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, foundation drains,
uncontaminated cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process waters, shall
not be permitted to discharge into any sanitary sewer facility, but shall
connect to an adequate drainage outlet.
   (B)   In addition to running storm sewer mains in the streets, each lot in
the subdivision, shall have a 4" line stubbed off of this main storm sewer to
carry the rainwater from downspouts, foundation drains, and other storm water
away from the property. This connection shall be located on the as-built
drawings of the plat and shall extend behind the sidewalk of the property for
easy access for the homeowner.
(Ord. 20-89, passed 6-28-89; Am. Ord. 11-98, passed 6-10-98)
§ 155.086  CULVERTS AND BRIDGES.
   Where natural drainage channels intersect any street right-of-way, it shall

culverts constructed. Where culverts are required, minimum requirements shall
be observed as follows:
   (A)   All culverts shall extend across the entire right-of-way width of the
proposed street. The cover over the culvert and its capacity shall be
determined by the developer's engineer and approved by the city. The minimum
diameter of a culvert pipe shall be 18 inches. Depending on existing drainage
conditions, head walls and protective rip-rap are required.
   (B)   Driveway culverts shall have a minimum length of 20 feet and a minimum
diameter of 12 inches. The driveway culverts shall be laid so as to maintain
the flow lines of the ditch or gutter. Headwalls may be required.
(Ord. 20-89, passed 6-28-89)
§ 155.087  ELECTRIC, GAS, AND TELEPHONE IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Electric service and telephone service shall be provided within each
subdivision. Gas service may be required where reasonably accessible.

constructed underground except in cases where the City Engineer determines that
geographic, bedrock, underground water, or other conditions would result in
excessive costs to the subdivider.
   (B)   Overhead utility lines are not permitted. The width of the easement
per lot shall be not less than five feet and the total easement width shall be
not less than ten feet.
   (C)   Whenever a sanitary sewer line and electric and/or telephone line are
each placed underground in the same utility easement, the following provisions
shall be applicable:
      (1)   The total easement width shall be not less than 20 feet; and
      (2)   The sanitary sewer line shall be installed within three feet of one
side of the easement, and the electric and/or telephone lines shall be
installed within three feet of the opposite side of the easement.

§ 155.088  OVER-SIZE AND OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS.
   The utilities, pavements, and other land improvements required for the
proposed subdivision shall be designed of over-size, if appropriate, and/or
with extensions provided to serve nearby land which is an integral part of the
neighborhood service or drainage area as determined by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 20-89, passed 6-28-89)
§ 155.089  COST OF OVER-SIZE IMPROVEMENTS.
   The subdivider shall be required to pay for only that part of the
construction costs for the arterial streets or trunk sewers which are serving
the proposed subdivision as determined by the city. The city shall pay the
difference between the cost of required improvements for the proposed
subdivision and improvements required to service the surrounding areas.
(Ord. 20-89, passed 6-28-89)
§ 155.090  EXTENSIONS TO BOUNDARIES.
   The subdivider shall be required to extend the necessary improvements,
especially all streets and roadways, to the boundary of the proposed
subdivision to service adjoining unsubdivided land, as determined by the City
Planning Commission.
(Ord. 20-89, passed 6-28-89)
§ 155.091  OFF-SITE EXTENSIONS.
   If streets or utilities are not available at the boundary of a proposed
subdivision, and if the City Planning Commission finds the extensions across
undeveloped areas would not be warranted as a special assessment to the
intervening properties or as a municipal expense until some future time, the
subdivider may be required, prior to approval of the final plat, to obtain
necessary easements or rights-of-way and construct and pay for such extensions.
Such improvements shall be available for connections by subdividers of
adjoining land.
(Ord. 20-89, passed 6-28-89)
§ 155.092  FINAL INSPECTION.

   (B)   Rules of application.
      (1)   Identification of uses.  Listed uses are to be defined by their
customary name or identification, except as specifically defined or limited in
this chapter.
      (2)   Permitted uses.  Only a use designated as permitted shall be
allowed as a matter of right in any zoning district, and any use not so
designated shall be prohibited except, when in character with the zoning
district, such additional uses may be added to permitted uses by formal
amendment, in conformance with the procedures specified in §
156.227 of this chapter.  No more than one permitted use shall exist on any one
zoning lot.
      (3)   Accessory uses.  An accessory use or structure is a subordinate use
or structure clearly incidental to and customary in connection with the

      (4)   Conditional uses.  A use designated as a conditional use shall be
allowed in the zoning district where the designation occurs, when such use, its

character of the vicinity, or unduly interfere with or adversely impact the use
of adjacent lots.  To this end, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall, in addition
to the development standards for the specific district, set forth additional
requirements as will render the conditional use compatible with existing and
future use of adjacent lots in the vicinity, in accordance with §§

156.211 of this chapter.
      (5)   Similar uses.
         (a)   Determination as to whether a use is similar to uses permitted

similar shall thereafter be considered as a permitted use in that district.
         (b)   Applications for zoning permits for a use not specifically
listed in the permitted building or use classifications of the zoning district,
which the applicant feels qualifies as a similar use under the provisions of
this section, shall be submitted to the Planning Commission.

use, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing.  The public hearing
shall be advertised according to the requirements of §
156.227(E)(1) of this chapter.
         (d)   Within 30 days after the public hearing, the Planning Commission
shall determine whether the requested use is similar to those uses permitted in
the specific district in order to find that a use is similar, the Planning
Commission shall find that all of the following conditions exist:
            1.   Such use is not listed as a permitted or conditional use in
another zoning district.
            2.   Such use conforms to basic characteristics of the
classification to which it is to be added and is more appropriate to it than to
any other classification.
            3.   Such use creates no danger to health and safety and creates no
offensive noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare, or other
objectionable influences to an extent greater than normally resulting from uses
listed in the classification to which it is to be added.
            4.   Such use does not create traffic congestion to a greater
extent than uses listed in the classification to which it is to be added.
      (6)   Development standards.  Development standards set forth shall be
the minimum allowed for development in a district.  If development standards
are in conflict with requirements of any other lawfully adopted rule,
regulation, or law, the most restrictive standard shall govern.
      (7)   Essential services.  Essential services, as defined and specified
in §§
156.004 and
156.005 of this chapter, shall be permitted in any and all zoning districts
within the municipality.  Buildings housing those activities related to such
services shall be permitted in the CF District.

   (F)   Off-site impacts.  No land or structure in the LI or GE Districts
shall be used or occupied in such a manner so as to create any dangerous,
injurious, noxious or otherwise objectionable impact on any land which is
located in any other zoning district.  Such impacts may result from noise,
vibration, odor, smoke or dust, or glare.  Statements in writing that such uses
comply or will comply with such uses may be required by the Planning Commission
from the owner.  In cases of doubt, the city shall select and arrange for an
independent survey by a professional engineer qualified in the particular field
and the costs for such service shall be paid by the applicant.
      (1)   Noise.  The sound pressure level of any operation on a lot within
the LI or GE Districts shall not exceed the average intensity of street traffic
noise in the nearest residential districts, and no sound shall be objectionable

§ 156.044  (HD) HISTORIC DISTRICT (OVERLAY).
   (A)   Purpose. 
      (1)   The city contains numerous historic architectural and environmental
assets that establish an environmental character. This environmental character
is directly linked to the economic, social, historical and cultural health and
well-being of the community.  The purpose of the Historic District is to
protect and preserve these assets and to prevent intrusions and alterations
within the established districts which would be incompatible with their
established character.
      (2)   The Historic District is an Overlay District. This means that the
requirements of this section are requirements which must be met in addition to
the established requirements and standards of the base district over which the
Historic District is placed.
   (B)   Definitions.  For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      (1)   ALTERATION.  Any action to change, modify reconstruct, remove or
demolish any exterior features of an existing structure or site within the
Historic District. For the purpose of this item, ordinary maintenance to
correct any deterioration, decay or damage to a structure or premises and to
restore the structure as nearly as practicable, is excluded from the definition
of ALTERATION, provided such work does not involve a change in type of building
materials.
      (2)   ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTER.  The architectural style, general design,
and general arrangement of the exterior of a building or other structure
including the type and texture of the light fixtures, signs and other
appurtenant fixtures.  In the case of an outdoor advertising sign, EXTERIOR
FEATURES means the style, material, size and location of the sign.
      (3)   APPLICANT.  Any person, persons, association, organization,
partnership, unit of government public body or corporation who applies for a
Certificate of Appropriateness in order to undertake an environmental change
within the District.
      (4)   BOARD.  The Historic District Review Board of the city.

removal of any property subject to the provisions of this section.
      (8)   PRESERVE or PRESERVATION.  The process, including maintenance, of
treating an existing building to arrest or slow future deterioration, stabilize
the structure and provide structural safety without changing or adversely
affecting the character or appearance of the structure.
      (9)   OWNER.  The owner of record, and the term shall include the plurals
well as the singular.
   (C)   District boundaries.  The Historic District shall consist of areas to
be identified and designated by City Council under separate ordinance.  The
designation of such areas shall be made by Council after obtaining a
recommendation from Planning Commission, and holding a public hearing.  Prior
to that hearing, notification shall be given to all property-owners and
residents of the proposed district, pursuant to the same requirements for
zoning amendment.
   (D)   Historic District Review Board.
      (1)   Establishment and corporation.  The Historic District Review Board
is hereby established consisting of the five members of the Planning
Commission, and two additional members appointed by City Council for terms of
three years. Both additional members shall be residents of the city, and at
least one of these two additional members shall be a resident or property-owner
of the Historic District.  In appointing these two additional members, the
Council shall make good faith effort to appoint persons with professional
training in the fields of architecture, landscape architecture, design or urban
planning.
      (2)   Procedures.  The Historic District Review Board shall adopt its own
procedural rules and guidelines.
   (E)   Certificate of appropriateness required.  No environmental change
shall be made to any property within the Historic District until a certificate
of appropriateness has been properly applied for, and issued by the Board.  No
building permit or certificate of zoning compliance shall be issued by the
Building and Zoning Inspector for any construction, reconstruction, alteration
or demolition of any structure now or here-after in the Historic District or
subject to the historic process, unless a certificate of appropriateness has
been issued.
   (F)   Procedure for certificate of appropriateness.
      (1)   The application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made
on such forms as prescribed by the Building and Zoning Inspector, along with
such plans, drawings, specifications and other materials as may be needed by
the Board to make a determination.  At a minimum, such information shall
include the following:
         (a)   Site plan showing building outlines, dimensions and landscaping.
         (b)   A complete description of the proposed environmental change.
      (2)   Applications for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be filed
with the Building and Zoning Inspector at least 15 days prior to the meeting of
the Historic District Review Board.
      (3)   The Board shall determine whether the proposed environmental change
will be appropriate to the preservation of the environmental, architectural or
historic character of the Historic District, pursuant to the criteria specified
in divisions (G) and (H) of this section.
      (4)   In determining the appropriateness of a specific environmental
change, the Board may conduct a public hearing on the project and/or solicit
input from consultants to the city.
      (5)   If no action is taken within 60 days from the date of application,
the certificate of appropriateness shall be issued as a matter of law.
   (G)   Criteria of evaluation of application for certification of design
appropriateness.  In considering the appropriateness of any proposed
environmental change, including landscaping or exterior signage, the Historic
District Review Board shall consider the following:
      (1)   The visual and functional components of the building and its site,
including but not limited to, building height, massing and proportion, roof
shape and slope, landscape design and plant materials, lighting, vehicular and
pedestrian circulation, and signage.
      (2)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a historic
building, structure, site and/or its environment shall not be destroyed.  The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural or
environmental features should be avoided when possible.
      (3)   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance inconsistent or inappropriate to the original
integrity of the building shall be discouraged.
      (4)   Whereas changes which may have taken place in the course of time
are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site
and its environment, if these changes are deemed to have acquired significance,
then this significance shall be recognized and respected.
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
      (6)   Significant architectural features which have deteriorated shall be
repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities.  Repair or
placement of architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of
the feature, and if possible, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial
evidence rather than on conjectural designs or availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
      (7)   The surface cleaning of masonry structures shall be undertaken with
methods designed to minimize damage to historic building materials.
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building
materials should be avoided.
      (8)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
      (9)   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original
structure would be unimpaired.  Additions to the least significant and least
visible of historic properties should be given priority over other designs.
   (H)   Design criteria.  The design standards for the Historic District are
described below.  A complete copy of the Downtown Design Review Standards is
kept on file in the office of the City Auditor. (Ord. 2-92, passed 3-11-92; Am.
Ord. 6-93, passed 3-24-93; Am. Ord. 10-94, passed 5-23-94; Am. Ord. 32-94,
passed 11-21-94)
      (1)   Existing structures and premises. Reconstruction or rehabilitation
within the Historic District shall conform to the distinguishing, original
exterior qualities or character of the structure, its site, and its
environment.
      (2)   New construction. The design of new structures and of additions to
existing structures, including new site improvements, shall make into account
the architectural style, general design, arrangement, texture, material and
color of other structures and premises within the individual precinct.
      (3)   Materials.
         (a)   All new structures and all reconstruction or remodeling of
existing structures within the Historic District shall utilize natural
traditional exterior materials such as brick, stone, masonry and wood.
         (b)   The use of contemporary materials, such as aluminum, other
metals, fiberglass and plastics for exterior surfaces on architecturally
significant structures shall be prohibited unless the use of such materials
would contribute to preservation or enhancement of existing traditional
materials and the overall integrity and longevity of a structure.
      (4)   Color.  Traditional colors and combinations of those colors that
are both identified with the origin or the era in which the structure of
property was originally built, shall be used for exteriors for all new
structures to be built, and reconstruction, remodeling and exterior maintenance
of existing structures within the Historic District.
      (5)   Signs.  All signs within the Historic District shall conform to
color and material standards of this section, be of such a style or design that
reflects the era during which the structure was built, and shall conform to the
requirements of §§
156.110 through
156.118 of this chapter.  Sign size and shape shall also respond to the
existing proportions of period structures, and signs shall not be permitted to
cover, “blank-out” or close existing window and doorway openings or otherwise
hide important architectural features.
   (I)   Demolition of structures.  In cases where an applicant applies for a
Certificate of Appropriateness to demolish a structure within the Historic
District, the Historic District Review Board shall grant the demolition and
issue a certificate of appropriateness when at least one of the following
conditions prevail.
      (1)   The structure contains no features of architectural and historic
significance to the character of the individual precinct within which it is
located.
      (2)   There exists no reasonable economic use for the structure as it
exists or as it might be restored, and that there exists no feasible and
prudent alternative to demolition.
      (3)   Deterioration has progressed to the point where it is not
economically feasible to restore the structure.
   (J)   Maintenance.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent
ordinary maintenance or repair of any property within the Historic District,
provided such work involves no change in material, design, texture, color or
exterior appearance; nor shall anything in this section be construed to prevent
any change, including the construction, reconstruction, alteration or
demolition of any feature which in the view of the Building and Zoning
inspector is required for the public safety because of an unsafe, insecure or
dangerous condition.
   (K)   Appeals.  Any applicant aggrieved by any decision of the Board may
appeal the decision to the City Council. Such appeal shall be taken by the
filing of a written statement, setting forth the grounds for the appeal, with
the Clerk of City Council within 30 days of the decision of the Board. The City
Council may reverse, remand, or modify such decision and shall state the
reasons therefore.
   (L)   Penalty.  Whoever constructs, reconstructs, alters, or modifies any
exterior architectural or environmental feature now or hereafter within the
Historic District in violation of this section, shall be deemed to be guilty of
a misdemeanor, subject to the penalties specified in §
156.999 of this chapter.
(Ord. 34-90, passed 12-26-90)
§ 156.045  PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of these regulations is to provide for Planned Unit
Development (PUD) within the city in order to achieve:
         (a)   A greater choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and building types and permitting an increased net density per acre.
         (b)   A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if
permitted as part of the project, more efficiency in the location of accessory
commercial uses and services.
         (c)   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural
topography and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation and
prevents the disruption of natural drainage patterns.
         (d)   A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development resulting in substantial savings through shorter
utilities and streets.
         (e)   A development pattern in harmony with land use density,
transportation facilities, and community facilities objectives of the
comprehensive plan.
      (2)   The city is prepared to accept a higher density in undeveloped
areas than that reflected by present zoning, provided the developer can
demonstrate that any increment of public cost clearly attributable to increased
densities will be compensated for by the private amenities and public benefits
to be achieved by the plan of development.
   (B)   Definition.  For the purpose of this section, PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
or PUD shall mean an area of land in which a variety of housing types and
subordinate commercial facilities are accommodated in a planned environment
under more flexible standards, such as lot sizes and setbacks, than those
restrictions that would normally apply under these regulations.  The approval
of such development contains requirements in addition to those of the standard
zoning districts, such as building design principles, and landscaping plans.
   (C)   Interpretation.  Whenever the requirements of this section appear to
be in conflict with other sections of this chapter or with those of other
existing codes, the provisions of this section shall prevail.
   (D)   Permitted and conditional uses.
      (1)   Permitted uses within the R, B-1 and CF Districts may be combined
in the PUD District, provided that the proposed location of non-residential
uses are compatible with the design of the overall tract, will not adversely
impact adjacent property, and that the location of such uses are specified in
the preliminary and final development plans.
      (2)   The amount of land devoted to non-residential uses in a development
combining residential and non-residential uses shall require approval by the
Planning Commission.
   (E)   Minimum project area.  The gross area of a tract of land proposed to
be developed in a planned unit development district shall be a minimum of ten
acres. This requirement may be waived by the Planning Commission if all
property abutting the subject tract is platted and/or developed.
   (F)   Common open space.
      (1)   A minimum of 20% of the gross land area developed in any planned
unit development project shall be reserved for common open space and/or
recreational facilities of the residents or users of the area being developed. 
Such common open space shall be:
         (a)   Dedicated to a homeowner's association who shall have title to
the land which shall be retained as common open space. The legal articles
relating to the organization of the homeowner's association shall be subject to
review and approval by the Planning Commission and shall provide adequate
provisions for the perpetual care and maintenance of all such common areas;
         (b)   Dedicated to the city for parks, open space, or the site of
schools or other related public facilities.  All land so dedicated to the city
shall be subject to the review and approval of the Planning Commission subject
to size, shape and location; or
         (c)   Some combination of divisions (F)(1)(a) and (b) of this section.
      (2)   Public utility and similar easements and rights-of-way for water
courses or other similar channels are not acceptable for common open space
dedication unless such land or right-of-way is usable as a bikeway, trail or
similar facility and has been approved by the Board.
   (G)   Utilities.  All electrical, telephone, cable television, and similar
utility systems shall be located underground.
   (H)   Arrangement of commercial uses.
      (1)   When planned unit development districts include commercial uses,
commercial buildings and establishments shall be planned as groups having
common parking areas and common ingress and egress points in order to reduce
traffic congestion and mitigate potential conflict points.  Planting screens or
fences shall be provided on the perimeter of the commercial areas abutting
residential areas.
      (2)   The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and
harmonious design of buildings, and for adequate and properly arranged
facilities for internal traffic circulation, landscaping, and such other
features and facilities as may be necessary to make the project attractive and
efficient from the standpoint of the adjoining and surrounding non-commercial
areas.
      (3)   Service, delivery, and loading areas shall be, to the maximum
possible extent, located to the rear of structures, and screened from view by
landscaping.
      (4)   Parking areas shall be designed so as to discourage single large
unbroken paved lots and shall encourage smaller defined parking areas within
the total parking system.  Such defined parking areas should be delineated and
accented by landscaped areas.
   (I)   Residential density.  The maximum residential density shall be eight
dwelling units per acre, based on the number of units proposed divided by the
area of the site designated for residential use, excluding streets and common
areas.
   (J)   Private roads.
      (1)   Private roads as a common easement may be used to provide internal
circulation to clustered lots and/or individual residential structures in
residential planned unit developments in accordance with the following:
         (a)   The easement shall not be counted as required open space.
   (b)   Approved as part of the subdivision plat as the most appropriate form
of access to lots and/or structures.
      (2)   Private roads shall not be used to provide access to nonresidential
areas.
   (K)   Other standards.  The applicable sections of the Subdivision
Regulations (
Chapter 155 of this code of ordinances), and the off-street parking, signage
and landscaping regulations of this Zoning Code shall apply.
   (L)   Procedure for approval of PUD District.  Planned Unit Development
Districts shall be approved in accordance with the procedures specified in
divisions (M) - (V) of this section.
   (M)   Pre-application.  The developer is encouraged to meet with the
Building and Zoning Inspector and Planning Commission prior to the submission
of the preliminary development plan. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss
early and informally the purposes of this section and the criteria and
standards contained herein, and to familiarize the developer with the Planned
Unit Development process, and major thoroughfare plan, the subdivision
regulations, and the drainage, sewer, and water systems within the city.

      (1)   Ten copies of the completed application and Preliminary Development
Plan shall be submitted to the Building and Zoning Inspector at least ten days
prior to the Planning Commission's next scheduled meeting.  Failure to submit a
complete application, as determined by the Building and Zoning Inspector, shall
result in a refusal of acceptance.
      (2)   The Building and Zoning Inspector shall transmit the complete
application package to the Planning Commission, and other parties as the
Building and Zoning Inspector deems appropriate, for review and comment.
      (3)   A public hearing of the Planning Commission shall be held not more
than 45 days from the date of acceptance of the application package.  The
procedure for notification of such healing shall be set forth in §
156.227(E)(1) and (2) of this chapter.
   (P)   Action by Planning Commission.  Within 35 days from the public
hearing, the Planning Commission shall review the application for preliminary
development plan and forward one of the following recommendations to City
Council:
      (1)   Recommend that the zoning amendment be granted as requested.
      (2)   Recommend modification of zoning amendment.
      (3)   Recommend that the zoning amendment be denied.
   (Q)   Criteria for recommendations by Planning Commission.
      (1)   Before making its recommendation as required in division (P) of
this section, the Planning Commission shall find that the facts submitted with
the application and presented at the public hearing establish that:
         (a)   Each individual unit of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability; the uses proposed will not
be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but will have a
beneficial effect which could not be achieved under standard district
regulations.
         (b)   The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate
to carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic
in such amounts as to overload the street network outside the planned unit
development.
         (c)   Any proposed commercial development can be justified at the
locations proposed.
         (d)   Any exception from standard district requirements is warranted
by the design and other amenities incorporated in the final development plan,
in accord with the Planning Commission.
         (e)   The area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned
in coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development.
         (f)   The existing and proposed public services are adequate for the
population densities and uses proposed, and in conformance with planned capital
improvements.
      (2)   In making its recommendation, the Planning Commission may seek the
assistance and input of outside consultants and/or experts procured for that
purpose.
   (R)   Action by City Council.  Upon receipt of the recommendation by the
Commission, City Council shall review and take action on the application,
following the procedures specified in §
156.227(F) of this chapter.  Following approval by City Council, the subject
shall be considered as zoned PUD.  The approval of that zoning shall be
conditioned on development of the tract being in conformance with the Final
Development Plan.
   (S)   Final Development Plan.  Not later than 12 months from the approval of
the Preliminary Development Plan, the developer shall submit ten copies of the
Final Development Plan to the Planning Commission.  The Final Development Plan
shall be in general conformance with the Preliminary Development Plan.  Failure
to submit a Final Development Plan within the specified time period shall
render the approved Preliminary Development Plan and the rezoning of the
property null and void.
   (T)   Contents of application or approval of Final Development Plan.  An
application for approval of the Final Development Plan shall be filed with the
Building and Zoning Inspector at least ten days prior to the Board's next
scheduled meeting by at least one owner or lessee of property for which the
planned unit development is proposed.  Each application shall be signed by the
owner or lessee, attesting to the truth and exactness of all information
supplied on the application for Final Development Plan.  The Final Development
Plan shall be prepared by a registered architect, engineer, or landscape
architect and, at a minimum, shall contain the following information:
      (1)   A survey of the proposed development site, showing the dimensions
and bearings of the property lines, areas in acres, topography, existing
features of the development site, including major wooded areas, structures,

anticipated timing for each unit; and population density and public
improvements proposed for each unit of the development whenever the applicant
proposes an exception from standard zoning districts or other resolution
governing development.
      (4)   Engineering feasibility studies and plans showing, as necessary,
water, sewer, drainage, electricity, telephone, and natural gas installations;
waste disposal facilities; street improvements, and nature and extent of earth
work required for traffic circulation and street improvements, and nature and
extent of earth work required for site preparation and development.
      (5)   Site plan, showing building(s), various functional use areas,
circulation and their relationship.
      (6)   Architectural renderings and accompanying narrative to discuss in
detail the design treatment of all buildings and structures where applicable.
      (7)   Landscaping plans.
      (8)   Deed restrictions, protective covenants, and other legal statements
or devices to be used to control the use, development and maintenance of land,
and the improvements thereon, including those areas which are commonly owned

the approved Preliminary Development Plan, and that no significant constraints
exist to construction of the project as planned.
   (W) Expiration and extension of approval period.  The approval of the Final
Development Plan shall be for a period of not to exceed three years.  If no
construction has begun within three years after approval is granted, the
approved development plan shall be null and void, and the land shall revert to
the zoning district in which it was located prior to the amendment.  An
extension of this time limit may be approved if the Planning Commission finds
that such extension is in the public interest.
   (X)   Platting.
      (1)   The creation of new parcels under any planned unit development
shall be subject to platting under the Subdivision Regulations.  Failure to
submit an application for platting of a portion of such property no later than
24 months from the effective date of the rezoning shall render the zoning null
and void and the property shall revert to its previous zoning classification.
      (2)   To reduce the length of the review and approval process, a
preliminary subdivision plat can be submitted simultaneously with the
Development Plan for rezoning to the PUD District to initiate both rezoning and
subdivision processes. A final subdivision plat cannot be submitted for review
until an amendment to the Zoning Code has been approved by City Council and
such amendment has become effective.

NONCONFORMING USES
§ 156.075  INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this chapter, or amendments hereinafter
adopted, there may exist lots, structures, uses of land and structure which
were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which would be
prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future
amendments.  It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities

allowed by law, but not to encourage their survival.
(Ord. 34-90, passed 12-26-90)
§ 156.076  WHEN PERMITTED.
   (A)   Existing land or buildings.  Any use of land or buildings existing on

with the zoning ordinance in effect in the municipality at the time that the
use or structure was established.  No nonconforming building, structure, or use
shall be moved, extended, enlarged, reconstructed, or structurally altered,
except as specifically provided in this chapter.
   (B)   Construction commenced.  Any property purchased or acquired in good
faith for any nonconforming use prior to the adoption of this chapter, upon
which property the work of changing, remodeling or construction of such
nonconforming use has been legally commenced at the time of adoption of this
chapter, may he used for the nonconforming use for which such changing,
remodeling or construction was undertaken, provided that such work is completed
within two years from the date of adoption of this chapter or amendment hereto
making said use nonconforming.
(Ord. 34-90, passed 12-26-90)  Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.077  SUBSTITUTION.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may allow the nonconforming use of a building or

restricted classification, provided no structural alterations except those
required by law or ordinance are made.  However, in an “R” District, no change
shall he authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals to any use which is not a
permitted or conditional use in any “R” District, and in a nonresidential
district, no change shall be authorized to any use which is not permitted or
conditional use in that district where the nonconforming use is first listed.
(Ord. 34-90, passed 12-26-90)
§ 156.078  EXTENSION.

nonconforming use to be enlarged to an extent not exceeding 20% of the ground
floor area of the existing building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use
at the time of enactment of this chapter or at the time of its amendment making
the use non-conforming. The Board shall not authorize an extension which would
result in a violation of the provision of this chapter with respect to any
adjoining premises, or which would occupy ground space required for meeting the
yard or other requirements of this chapter. 
   (B)   No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or in
part to any other location unless such building or structure and the yard and
other open spaces provided are made to conform to all of the regulations of the
district in which such building or structure is to be located.
   (C)   Any residential structure which is nonconforming due to the fact of
its being in a non- residential zoning district may be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed or structurally altered provided it meets the requirements of the
adjacent or most proximate R-District.
(Ord. 34-90, passed 12-26-90)
§ 156.079  DISCONTINUANCE.
   A nonconforming use which has been discontinued or abandoned shall not
thereafter be returned to a nonconforming use.  A nonconforming use shall be
considered abandoned whenever any one of the following conditions exist:

§ 156.082  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district where dwellings are permitted, a one-family detached
dwelling or accessory building if the lot is already occupied by a one-family
residence, may be erected on any lot of official record on the effective date
of this chapter, even though such lot does not comply with the lot area and
width requirements of the district in which it is located, provided said lot
has a minimum of 35 feet frontage on a public street; and further provided the
following conditions are complied with:
   (A)   In any district where dwellings are permitted, two inches may be
deducted from the required minimum width of each side yard and four inches from

narrower than the required width for the district. In no case, however, shall
any side yard be narrower than four feet.
   (B)   For lots having a depth of less than 110 feet, the depth of the rear
yard need not exceed 25% of the total depth of the lot, but shall not be less

§ 156.228  APPEALS; VARIANCES.
   (A)   Appeals.  Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals concerning
interpretation or administration of this chapter may be taken by any person
aggrieved including a tenant, or by a governmental officer, department, board,
or bureau.  Such appeal shall be taken within 20 days after the date of the
decision, by filing with the Building and Zoning Inspector or with the Board of
Zoning Appeals, a notice of appeal specifying the decision of the Building and
Zoning Inspector which the appeal is being taken.
   (B)   Powers of the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to authorize, upon
appeal in specific cases, filed as hereinafter provided, such variances from
the provisions or requirements of the ordinance as will not be contrary to the
public interest.  Such variances shall be granted only in cases of exceptional
conditions, involving irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots, or other
exceptional physical conditions of the land, whereby strict application of such
provisions or requirements would result in practical difficulty and unnecessary
hardship that would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land and
buildings involved.  No variance from strict application of any provision of
this chapter shall be granted by the Board unless it finds that all the
following facts and conditions exist:
         (a)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions specific to the land or
building for which the variance is sought, and such conditions do not apply
generally to land or buildings in the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located.
         (b)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with
the provisions of the Zoning Code and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
         (c)   That such necessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
         (d)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
         (e)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
      (2)   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant an
appeal or variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this
chapter in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication
prohibited by the terms of this chapter in said district.
   (C)   Application for variance and appeals. 
      (1)   Any person owning or having an interest in property, after being

   Editor’s note:
This table lists those Ohio Revised Code sections which have been substantially
duplicated by corresponding Code of Ordinance sections.  All legislative
history references to “(R.C. § xx.xx)” which appear at the end of sections (or
divisions of sections) in the village’s Code of Ordinances have been listed
here.  Example: to determine which section of the Code of Ordinances is based
on R.C. § 4511.19, scan down this table to the citation for “4511.19" and
examine the entry across from it: in this case, the corresponding Code of
Ordinances section is § 72.055, which means that § 72.055 (or a part thereof)
is based directly on R.C. § 4511.19.
