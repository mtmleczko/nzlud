PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Salisbury, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code, as supplemented through August 1, 1989, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indices themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Rivers Lawther, City Attorney, and Ms. Virginia P. Petrea, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

ARTICLE 2. - LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS 

Section 8.40. - Streets, curbs and gutters, sidewalks, and driveways.

In addition to any authority which is now or may hereafter be granted to the city for making street, curb and gutter or sidewalk improvements, the city council is hereby authorized to order such improvements and to assess the total cost thereof against abutting properties without the necessity of a petition of property owners. 
(b)  Sidewalk repairs. The council is further authorized to order or to make sidewalk repairs and driveway repairs across sidewalks according to standards and specifications of the city, and to assess the total cost thereof against abutting properties without the necessity of a petition of property owners. 
(c)  Sidewalk on one side of street. If a sidewalk is constructed on only one side of the street, the cost thereof may be assessed against the property abutting on both sides of the street, unless there already exists a sidewalk on the other side of the street, the total cost of which was assessed against the abutting property. 
(d)  Notice to property owners. Before the city council shall order improvements to be made pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section it shall hold a public hearing thereon, and shall give the owners of the property to be assessed written notice of such public hearing and the proposed action. 
(e)  Assessment procedure and effect. In ordering street, curb and gutter or sidewalk improvements or sidewalk repairs and assessing the cost thereof, the council shall follow the procedures provided by the General Statutes for street and sidewalk improvements, except those provisions relating to the petition of property owners and the sufficiency thereof.

(f)  Duty of maintenance for driveways and sidewalks. It is the duty of every property owner to maintain the sidewalks and driveways abutting his property in good repair and safe condition. 
(g)  Payment of assessments. Any special assessment of the city for any purpose amounting to less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be paid in cash within ninety (90) days of confirmation rather than in annual installments, and shall bear interest as taxes. Any property owner shall have the option of paying assessments for local improvements in cash or in not less than two (2) nor more than ten (10) equal annual installments, as may have been determined by the city council in the resolution ordering the improvements. With respect to payment by installment, the council may direct: 
(1)  That installments shall become due and payable on the same date when property taxes of the city are due and payable; or 
(2)  That the first installment with interest shall become due and payable sixty (60) days after the date of the confirmation of the assessment roll, and one subsequent installment and interest shall be due and payable on the same day of the month in each successive year until the assessment is paid in full. Said assessments and installments shall bear interest as taxes. 
(h)  Assessment where street is city limit line. In those instances where the city limit line runs along a street or road the city council may order the improvements and assess the cost thereof against property abutting on both sides of the street as if all of the abutting property were within the corporate limits, regardless of whether the improvement is ordered pursuant to this section or other general law.

Such project may include both public and/or private buildings or facilities financed in whole or in part by federal or state grants (including but not limited to urban development action grants) and may include any capital expenditures which the city council finds necessary to comply with conditions in any federal or state grant agreements and which the city council finds will complement the project and improve the public tax base and general economy of the city.

Such a contract may, among other provisions, specify the responsibilities of the city and the developer or developers and operators or owners of the project, including the financing of the project. Such a contract may be entered into before the acquisition of any real property necessary to the project by the city or the developer or other parties. 
(c)  Property acquisition. An economic development project may be constructed on property acquired by the developer or developers, or on property directly acquired by the city, or on property acquired by the redevelopment commission or its successors while exercising the powers, duties and responsibilities pursuant to G.S. 160A-505. 
(d)  Property disposition. In connection with an economic development project, the city may convey interests in property owned by it, including air rights over public facilities, as follows: 
(1)  If the property was acquired under the urban redevelopment law, the property interests may be conveyed in accordance with special or general law. 
(2)  If the property was acquired by the city directly, the city may convey property interests by any procedure set forth in its City Charter, special act or the general law or by private negotiation or sale. 
(e)  Construction of the project.

If so, the contract shall include such provisions as the city council deems sufficient to assure that any public facilities included in the project meet the needs of the city and are constructed at a reasonable price. Any funds loaned by the city, pursuant to this paragraph, to a private developer, and used by said developer in the construction of a project on private property shall not be deemed an expenditure of public funds. 
(f)  Operation.

In addition, the city, upon consideration, may contract through lease or otherwise whereby it may operate privately constructed parking facilities to serve the general public.

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2018-54, § 1, adopted Oct. 16, 2018, amended Div. 2 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Div. 2, §§ 2-46-2-53, pertained to rules of procedure and derived from Code 1977, §§ 2-24-2-32. 

Sec. 2-46. - Applicability. 
    Rule 1. Applicability of Rules. 
    These rules apply to all meetings of the Salisbury City Council. For purposes of these rules, a meeting of the council occurs whenever a majority of the council's members gather, whether in person or simultaneously by electronic means, to conduct hearings, deliberate, vote, or otherwise transact public business within the council's real or apparent jurisdiction. The term "majority" as used here and elsewhere in these rules means, unless otherwise specified, a simple majority, that is, more than half. 
    The following governing principles shall be followed by the council and shall also serve as guidance for the application of these rules: 
(1)  The council must take only those actions that lie within its authority. 
(2)  The council must meet in order to act. 
(3)  Members of the council are equal participants. 
(4)  Members must receive proper notice of council meetings. 
(5)  A quorum is necessary for the council to act. 
(6)  There must be an opportunity for debate. 
(7)  Questions must be decided by voting. 
(8)  A majority vote is required to take action. 
(9)  Meetings of the council must be characterized by fairness and good faith. 
(Ord. No. 2018-54, § 1, 10-16-18) 
Sec. 2-47. - Quorum. 
    Rule 2. Quorum. 
    The presence of a quorum is necessary for the council to conduct business. A majority of the council's actual membership including the mayor, excluding vacant seats, constitutes a quorum. A member who withdraws from a meeting without being excused by majority vote of the remaining members in attendance is deemed present for quorum purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2018-54, § 1, 10-16-18) 
Sec. 2-48. - Open meetings. 
    Rule 3. Remote participation in council meetings. 
    A member who is not physically present for an official meeting of the city council may participate in the meeting by electronic means in accordance with a policy adopted and reviewed at the organizational meeting of the council, or at any other meeting at the discretion of the council. Although a member who attends a meeting electronically pursuant to such a policy may take part in debate, the member may neither be counted toward a quorum nor vote on any matter before the council. 
    Rule 4. Meetings to be open to the public. 
    Except as permitted by Rule 5, all meetings of the council shall be open to the public, and any person may attend its meetings. 
    Rule 5. Closed sessions. 
(a)  Motion to enter closed session. The city council may enter a closed session from which the public is excluded only upon a motion duly made and adopted in open session. The motion to enter closed session must cite one (1) or more of the permissible bases for closed session listed in paragraph (b) of this rule. A motion to enter closed session under subparagraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) must contain the additional information specified in those provisions. 
(b)  Bases for closed session. A closed session is permissible under the following circumstances and no others: 
(1)  To prevent the disclosure of information that is privileged or confidential pursuant to the law of North Carolina or of the United States or that does not constitute a public record within the meaning of G.S. ch. 132. The motion to enter closed session must name or cite the law that renders the information confidential or privileged. 
(2)  To consult with the city attorney or another attorney employed or retained by the city in order to preserve the attorney-client privilege. If the council expects to discuss a pending lawsuit with its attorney, the motion to enter closed session must include the names of the parties to the lawsuit. 
(3)  To discuss matters relating to (a) the location or expansion of industries or other businesses in the area served by the city or (b) the closure or realignment of a military installation. The council may reach agreement in closed session on a tentative list of economic development incentives to be offered in negotiations, but the approval of the signing of any economic development contract or commitment and the authorization of the payment of economic development expenditures must take place in open session. 
(4)  To establish or instruct staff or agents concerning the city's position in negotiating the price or other material terms of an agreement for the acquisition of real property by purchase, exchange, or lease. 
(5)  To establish or instruct staff or agents concerning the amount of compensation or other material terms of an employment contract. 
(6)  To consider the qualifications, competence, performance, character, fitness, or conditions of appointment or employment of a public officer or employee or prospective public officer or employee, except when the individual in question is a member of the city council or other public body or is being considered to fill a vacancy on the city council or other public body. Final action to appoint or employ a public officer or employee must take place in open session. 
(7)  To hear or investigate a charge or complaint by or against a public officer or employee. Final action discharging an employee or removing an officer must occur in open session. 
(8)  To plan, conduct, or hear reports concerning investigations of alleged criminal misconduct. 
(9)  To view a law enforcement recording released pursuant to G.S. 132-1.4A. 
(10)  On any other basis permitted by law. 
(c)  Closed session participants. Unless the council directs otherwise, the city manager, city attorney, and city clerk may attend closed sessions of the council. No other person may attend a closed session unless invited by the council. 
(d)  Motion to return to open session. Upon completing its closed session business, the council shall end the closed session by adopting a duly made motion to return to open session. 
    Rule 6. Meeting minutes. 
(a)  Minutes required for all meetings. The council must keep full and accurate minutes of all of its meetings, including closed sessions. To be "full and accurate," minutes must record all actions taken by the council. They should set out the precise wording of each motion and make it possible to determine the number of votes cast for and against each motion. The minutes need not record discussions of the council, though the council in its discretion may decide to incorporate such details into the minutes. 
(b)  Record of "ayes" and "noes." At the request of any member of the council, the minutes shall list each member by name and record how each member voted on a particular matter. 
(c)  General accounts of closed sessions. In addition to minutes, the council must keep a general account of each closed session. The general account must be sufficiently detailed to provide a person not in attendance with a reasonable understanding of what transpired. The council may combine the minutes and general account of a closed session into one (1) document, so long as the document contains both a complete record of actions taken and the level of detail required for a general account. 
(d)  Sealing closed session records. Minutes and general accounts of closed sessions shall be sealed until unsealed by order of the council or, if the council delegates the authority to unseal to one (1) or more staff members, in accordance with guidelines adopted by the council. The sealed minutes and general account of any closed session may be withheld from public inspection so long as public inspection would frustrate the purpose(s) of the closed session. 
    Rule 7. Broadcasting and recording meetings. 
(a)  Right to broadcast and record. Any person may photograph, film, tape-record, or otherwise reproduce any part of a council meeting that must take place in open session. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this rule, any radio or television station may broadcast any such part of a council meeting. 
(b)  Equipment placement. The city manager may regulate the placement and use of camera or recording equipment in order to prevent undue interference with a council meeting, so long as the city manager allows the equipment to be placed where it can carry out its intended function. If the city manager determines in good faith that the equipment and personnel necessary to broadcast, photograph, or record the meeting cannot be accommodated without undue interference to the meeting, and an adequate alternative meeting room is not readily available, the city manager may require the pooling of the equipment and the personnel operating it. 
(c)  Alternative meeting site. If the news media request an alternative meeting site to accommodate news coverage, and the council grants the request, the news media making the request shall pay the costs incurred by the city in securing an alternative meeting site. 
(Ord. No. 2018-54, § 1, 10-16-18) 
Sec. 2-49. - Organization of the council. 
    Rule 8. Organizational meeting; selection of mayor and mayor pro tempore. 
(a)  Scheduling organizational meeting. The council must hold an organizational meeting following each general election in which council members are elected. The organizational meeting must be held either (1) on the date and at the time of the council's first regular meeting in December following the election or (2) at an earlier date, if any, set by the incumbent council. The organizational meeting may not be held before municipal election results are officially determined, certified, and published as required by law. 
(b)  Oath of office. As the first order of business at the organizational meeting, all newly elected members of the council must take and subscribe the oath of office set out in Article VI, Section 7, of the North Carolina Constitution. Each member's oath must be filed with the city clerk. Although a member who is not present for the organizational meeting may take the oath of office at another time, every member must take, subscribe, and file the oath before the member begins performing any of the duties of the member's office. 
(c)  Selection of mayor and mayor pro tempore. As the second order of business at the organizational meeting, the council shall elect from among its members a mayor and a mayor pro tempore using the procedures specified in Rule 37. The mayor shall serve at the pleasure of the council in accordance with the City Charter. The mayor pro tempore shall likewise serve at the council's pleasure in accordance with the City Charter. 
(Ord. No. 2018-54, § 1, 10-16-18) 
Sec. 2-50. - Types of meetings. 
    Rule 9. Regular meetings.

A copy of the council's current meeting schedule shall be filed with the city clerk and posted on the city's website. 
(b)  Change to meeting schedule. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this rule, the council may amend its regular meeting schedule to add or delete meetings or to change the date, time, or location of one (1) or more meetings on the schedule. The amended schedule shall be filed with the city clerk at least seven (7) calendar days before the day of the first meeting held pursuant to the revised schedule and posted on the city's website. 
    Rule 10. Special meetings.

(b)  Notice to the public. At least forty-eight (48) hours before a special meeting of the council, notice of the date, time, place, and purpose of the meeting shall be (1) posted at the doors of City Hall and (2) delivered, e-mailed, or mailed to each newspaper, wire service, radio station, television station, and person who has filed a written request for notice with the city clerk. Furthermore, notice of the special meeting's date, time, place, and purpose shall be posted on the website in advance of the meeting. 
(c)  Notice to members. 
(1)  Meeting called by the mayor, the mayor pro tempore, or any two (2) council members. At least forty-eight (48) hours before a special meeting called by the mayor, the mayor pro tempore, or any two (2) council members, notice of the meeting stating its date, time, and place, as well as the subjects to be considered, shall be delivered by telephone, text, or e-mail to the mayor, mayor pro tempore, and each council member or left at the council member's usual dwelling place.

(2)  Meeting called by vote of the council in open session. When a special meeting is called by vote of the council in open session during a regular meeting or another duly called special meeting, the motion or resolution calling the special meeting shall state the meeting's date, time, place, as well as the subjects to be considered. Notice of the special meeting's date, time, place, and purpose shall be mailed or delivered by telephone, text, or e-mail at least forty-eight (48) hours before the meeting to each council member not present for the meeting at which the special meeting was called, and to the mayor or mayor pro tempore if the mayor or mayor pro tempore was not present at that meeting, in accordance with the preceding paragraph (1). 
(d)  Transacting other business. Unless all members are present or any absent member has signed a written waiver of notice, only those items of business specified in the notice to council members may be taken up at a special meeting. Even when all members are present or any absent member has signed a waiver, the council may take up an item of business not covered by the notice only upon an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the council's actual membership, and upon a determination by council in good faith that the item must be discussed or acted upon immediately. 
    Rule 11. Emergency meetings. 
(a)  Grounds for emergency meeting. Emergency meetings of the city council may be called only to address generally unexpected circumstances demanding the council's immediate consideration. 
(b)  Calling emergency meetings. There are two (2) methods by which an emergency meeting of the council may be called.

The city clerk shall make every reasonable effort to assure that each council member has actual notice of any such emergency meeting. 
(2)  An emergency meeting may be held when the mayor and all members of the council are present and consent thereto, or when any absent member has signed a written waiver of notice. 
(c)  Notice to media of emergency meetings. Notice of an emergency meeting shall be given to each local newspaper, local wire service, local radio station, and local television station that has filed a written request with the city clerk for notice of emergency meetings. To be valid, the request must include the newspaper's, wire service's, or station's telephone number. Notice may be given by telephone, e-mail, or the same method used to notify council members. Notice must be provided immediately after council members have been notified and at the expense of the party notified. 
(d)  Transaction of other business prohibited. Only business connected with the emergency may be considered at an emergency meeting. 
    Rule 12. Recessed meetings. 
(a)  Calling recessed meetings. When conducting a properly called regular, special, or emergency meeting, the council may recess the meeting to another date, time, or place by a procedural motion made and adopted, as provided in Rule 30, Motion 3, in open session. The motion must state the time (including the date, if the meeting will resume on a different day) and place at which the meeting will reconvene. 
(b)  Notice of recessed meetings. If the council has a website maintained by one (1) or more city employees, notice of the recessed meeting's date, time, and place must appear on the webpage prior to the meeting. No further notice of a properly called recessed meeting is required. 
(Ord. No. 2018-54, § 1, 10-16-18) 
Sec. 2-51. - Agenda. 
    Rule 13. Agenda. 
(a)  Draft agenda. 
(1)  Preparation. The city manager and city clerk shall prepare a draft agenda in advance of each meeting of the city council. 
(2)  Requesting placement of items on draft agenda. For a regular meeting, a request to have an item of business placed on the draft agenda should be received by the city manager or city clerk at least seven (7) days before the date of the meeting. The city manager or city clerk must place an item on the draft agenda in response to a council member's timely request. 
(3)  Supplemental information/materials. If the council is expected to consider a proposed ordinance, resolution, policy, procedure, or amendment thereof, a copy of the proposed ordinance, resolution, policy, procedure, or amendment thereof shall be attached to the draft agenda. A copy of any proclamation to be issued at a council meeting should also be included in the draft agenda. An agenda package shall be prepared that includes, for each item of business listed on the draft agenda, as much background information on the topic as is available and feasible to provide. 
(4)  Delivery to council members. Each council member shall receive a hard or electronic copy of the draft agenda and the agenda package. To the extent possible, except in the case of an emergency meeting, the agenda and agenda package should be furnished to each council member at least seven (7) days before the meeting. 
(5)  Public inspection. The draft agenda and agenda package shall be available to the public when the documents have been circulated. 
(b)  Adoption of the agenda. 
(1)  Adoption. As its first order of business at each meeting, the council shall review the draft agenda, make whatever revisions it deems appropriate, and adopt a formal agenda for the meeting. 
(2)  Amending the agenda. Both before and after it adopts the agenda, the council may add, subtract, or change the order of agenda items by majority vote of the members present and voting, except that 
i.  the council may not add to the items stated in the notice of a special meeting unless the requirements in Rule 10(d) are satisfied, and 
ii.  only business connected with the emergency may be considered at an emergency meeting. 
(3)  Action items/information items. The council may designate agenda items, except for the consent agenda described in paragraph (c), as action items or as information items. The council may, if it chooses, take action on information items following their presentation and discussion. 
(4)  Designation of items "For Discussion and Possible Action." The council may designate an agenda item "for discussion and possible action." The designation signifies that the council intends to discuss the item and may, if it so chooses, take action on the item following the discussion. 
(c)  Consent agenda. The council may designate part of an agenda for a regular meeting as the consent agenda. Items may be placed on the consent agenda by the city manager and city clerk if the items are judged to be noncontroversial and routine. Prior to the council's adoption of the meeting agenda under subparagraph (b)(1) of this rule, the request of any member to have an item moved from the consent agenda to the regular agenda must be honored by the council. All items on the consent agenda must be voted on and adopted by a single motion, with the minutes reflecting the motion and vote for each item. 
(d)  Informal discussion of agenda items. The council may informally discuss an agenda item even when no motion regarding that item is pending. 
    Rule 14. Acting by reference to agenda or other document. 
    The council shall not deliberate, vote, or otherwise take action on any matter by reference to the agenda or any other document with the intention of preventing persons in attendance from understanding what action is being considered or undertaken. The council may deliberate and vote by reference to the agenda or any item on the agenda, including the consent agenda, provided copies of the agenda are available for public inspection at the meeting and are sufficiently worded to enable the public to understand what is being deliberated or acted upon. 
    Rule 15. Agenda items from members of the public. 
    If a member of the public wishes to request that the council include an item on its regular meeting agenda, the request must be submitted to the city clerk or city manager by the deadline specified in Rule 13(a)(2). The council is not obligated to place an item on the agenda merely because such a request has been received. 
    Rule 16. Order of business. 
    Items shall be placed on a regular meeting agenda according to the order of business. The usual order of business for each regular meeting should be as follows: 
  adoption of the agenda, 
  approval of the consent agenda, 
  public comment, 
  public hearings, 
  administrative reports, 
  committee reports, 
  other business. 
    Without objection, the mayor may call agenda items in any order most convenient for the dispatch of business. 
(Ord. No. 2018-54, § 1, 10-16-18) 
Sec. 2-52. - Role of the presiding officer. 
    Rule 17. The mayor. 
(a)  Presiding officer. When present, the mayor shall preside at meetings of the council. 
(b)  Right to vote. The mayor votes on the same basis as other council members. 
(c)  Recognition of members. A member must be recognized by the mayor (or other presiding officer) in order to address the council, but recognition is not necessary for an appeal pursuant to Rule 30, Motion 1. 
(d)  Powers as presiding officer. As presiding officer, the mayor is to enforce these rules and maintain order and decorum during council meetings. To that end, the mayor may 
(1)  rule on points of parliamentary procedure, to include ruling out of order any motion clearly offered for obstructive or dilatory purposes; 
(2)  determine whether a member or other speaker has gone beyond reasonable standards of courtesy in the member's remarks and entertain and rule on objections from other members on this ground; 
(3)  entertain and answer questions of parliamentary procedure; 
(4)  call a brief recess at any time; and 
(5)  adjourn in an emergency. 
(e)  Appeals of procedural rulings. A member may appeal a decision made or answer given by the mayor under subparagraph (d)(1), (2), or (3) in accordance with Rule 30, Motion 1. 
    Rule 18. The mayor pro tempore. 
(a)  Presiding in mayor's absence. When present, the mayor pro tempore shall preside over council meetings in the mayor's absence with all the powers specified in Rule 17(d). 
(b)  Delegation of mayor's powers/duties. In the mayor's absence, the council may confer on the mayor pro tempore any of the mayor's powers and duties. Likewise, if the mayor becomes physically or mentally unable to perform the duties of the office, the council may by unanimous vote declare the mayor incapacitated and confer any of the mayor's powers and duties on the mayor pro tempore. When the mayor announces that the mayor is no longer incapacitated, and a majority of the council concurs, the mayor shall resume the powers and duties of the office. 
(c)  Duty to vote. Even when presiding over a council meeting, the mayor pro tempore has the same duty as other members to vote on all questions unless the mayor pro tempore has been excused from voting on a matter in accordance with Rule 28. 
    Rule 19. Other presiding officer. 
    If both the mayor and mayor pro tempore are absent, the council may elect from among its members a temporary presiding officer to chair the meeting. While serving as temporary presiding officer, a member has the powers listed in Rule 17(d). Service as a temporary presiding officer does not relieve a member of the duty to vote on all questions unless excused from voting pursuant to Rule 28. 
    Rule 20. When the presiding officer is active in debate. 
    If the mayor becomes active in debate on a particular proposal, the mayor may have the mayor pro tempore preside during the council's consideration of the matter. If the mayor pro tempore is absent or is also actively debating the matter, the mayor may designate another member to preside until the matter is concluded. Similarly, if the mayor pro tempore or a temporary presiding officer is presiding and takes an active part in debating a topic, the mayor pro tempore may designate another council member to preside temporarily. 
(Ord. No. 2018-54, § 1, 10-16-18) 
Sec. 2-53. - Motions and voting. 
    Rule 21. Action by the council. 
    Except as otherwise provided in these rules, the council shall act by motion. Any member may make a motion, including the mayor. 
    Rule 22. Second not required. 
    No second is required on any motion. 
    Rule 23. One (1) motion at a time. 
    A member may make only one (1) motion at a time. 
    Rule 24. Withdrawal of motion. 
    The member who introduces a motion may withdraw the motion unless the motion has been amended or the presiding officer has put the motion to a vote. 
    Rule 25. Debate. 
    The presiding officer shall state the motion and then open the floor to debate, presiding over the debate according to the principles listed below. 
  The maker of the motion is entitled to speak first. 
  A member who has not spoken on the issue shall be recognized before a member who has already spoken. 
  To the extent practicable, the debate shall alternate between proponents and opponents of the measure. 
    Rule 26. Adoption by majority vote. 
    A motion is adopted if supported by a simple majority of the votes cast, a quorum being present, except when a larger majority is required by these rules or state law. 
    Rule 27. Changing a vote. 
    A member may change a vote on a motion at any time before the presiding officer announces whether the motion has passed or failed. Once the presiding officer announces the result, a member may not change a vote without the unanimous consent of the remaining members present. A member's request for unanimous consent to change a vote is not in order unless made immediately following the presiding officer's announcement of the result. 
    Rule 28. Duty to vote. 
(a)  Duty to vote. Every council member must vote except when excused from voting as provided by this rule. 
(b)  Grounds for excusal. A member may be excused from voting on a matter involving the member's own financial interest or official conduct, though not if the proposal in question is one (1) to alter the compensation or allowances paid to council members. Members may also be excused from voting when prohibited from voting under G.S. 14-234 (contract providing direct benefit to member), G.S. 160A-381(d) (legislative zoning decision likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on member), or G.S. 160A-388(e)(2) (member's participation in quasi-judicial decision would violate affected person's right to an impartial decision maker). Questions about whether a basis for excusal exists should be directed to the city attorney. 
(c)  Procedure for excusal. 
(1)  At member's request. Upon being recognized at a duly called meeting of the council, a member who wishes to be excused from voting shall so inform the presiding officer, who must then submit the matter to a vote of the remaining members present. If a majority of the remaining members present vote to excuse the member, the member is excused from voting on the matter. 
(2)  On council's initiative. Even when a member has not asked to be excused from voting on a matter, a majority of the remaining council members present may by motion and vote excuse the member from voting if grounds for doing so exist under paragraph (b). 
(d)  Consequence of non-excused failure to vote. Except as specified in paragraph (e), if a member who has not been excused from voting fails to vote on a matter, the member's failure to vote shall be recorded as an affirmative vote, provided: 
(1)  the member is physically present in the council chamber or 
(2)  the member has physically withdrawn from the meeting without being excused by majority vote of the remaining members present. 
(e)  Failure to vote on certain zoning matters. A member's unexcused failure to vote shall not be recorded as an affirmative vote if the motion concerns a proposal to amend, supplement, or repeal a zoning ordinance. Instead, the member's unexcused failure to vote shall be recorded as an abstention. 
(f)  Mayor's duty to vote. The provisions of this rule apply to the mayor. 
    Rule 29. Substantive motions. 
    A substantive motion is not in order if made while another motion is pending. Once the council disposes of a substantive motion, it may not take up a motion that presents essentially the same issue at the same meeting, unless it first adopts a motion to reconsider pursuant to Rule 30, Motion 14. 
    Rule 30. Procedural motions. 
(a)  Certain motions allowed. The council may consider only those procedural motions listed in this rule. Unless otherwise noted, each procedural motion may be debated and amended and requires a majority of votes cast, a quorum being present, for adoption. 
(b)  Priority of motions. The procedural motions set out in this paragraph are listed in order of priority. A procedural motion is not in order so long as another procedural motion of higher priority is pending, except that 
  any procedural motion other than an appeal under Motion 1 is subject to amendment as provided in Motion 12, and 
  a motion to call the question (end debate) may be made with regard to any procedural motion in accordance with Motion 9. 
    When several procedural motions are pending, voting must begin with the procedural motion highest in priority, provided that a motion to amend or end debate on the highest priority motion must be voted on first. 
    Motion 1. To appeal a ruling of the presiding officer. Any member may appeal the presiding officer's ruling on whether a motion is in order or on whether a speaker has violated reasonable standards of courtesy. The presiding officer's response to a question of parliamentary procedure may also be appealed by any member. An appeal is in order immediately after the disputed ruling or parliamentary response and at no other time. The member who moves to appeal need not be recognized by the presiding officer, and if timely made, the motion may not be ruled out of order. 
    Motion 2. To adjourn. This motion may be used to close a meeting. It is not in order if the council is in closed session. 
    Motion 3. To recess to a time and place certain. This motion may be used to call a recessed meeting as permitted under Rule 12. The motion must state the time (including the date, if the meeting will reconvene on a different day) and place at which the meeting will resume. The motion is not in order if the council is in closed session. 
    Motion 4. To take a brief recess. 
    Motion 5. To follow the agenda. This motion must be made at the time an item of business that deviates from the agenda is proposed; otherwise, the motion is out of order as to that item. 
    Motion 6. To suspend the rules. To be adopted, a motion to suspend the rules must receive affirmative votes equal to at least two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the council's actual membership, including the mayor, excluding vacant seats. The council may not suspend provisions in these rules that are required under state law. 
    Motion 7. To divide a complex motion. This motion is in order whenever a member wishes to consider and vote on parts of a complex motion separately. The member who makes this motion must specify how the complex motion will be divided. 
    Motion 8. To defer consideration. The council may defer its consideration of a substantive motion, and any proposed amendments thereto, to an unspecified time. A motion that has been deferred expires unless the council votes to revive it pursuant to Motion 13 within 100 days of deferral. A new motion having the same effect as a deferred motion may not be introduced until the latter has expired. 
    Motion 9. To end debate (call the previous question). If adopted, this motion terminates debate on a pending motion, thereby bringing it to an immediate vote. This motion is not in order until every member has had an opportunity to speak once on the pending motion. 
    Motion 10. To postpone to a certain time. This motion may be employed to delay the council's consideration of a substantive motion, and any proposed amendments thereto, until a designated day, meeting, or hour. During the period of postponement, the council may not take up a new motion raising essentially the same issue without first suspending its rules pursuant to Motion 6. 
    Motion 11. To refer a motion to a committee. The council may vote to refer a substantive motion to a committee for study and recommendations. While the substantive motion is pending before the committee, the council may not take up a new motion raising essentially the same issue without first suspending its rules pursuant to Motion 6. If the committee fails to report on the motion within sixty (60) days of the referral date, the council must take up the motion if asked to do so by the member who introduced it. 
    Motion 12. To amend. 
(a)  Germaneness. A motion to amend must concern the same subject matter as the motion it seeks to alter. 
(b)  Limit on number of motions to amend. When a motion to amend is under consideration, a motion to amend the amendment may be made; however, no more than one (1) motion to amend and one (1) motion to amend the amendment may be pending at the same time. 
(c)  Amendments to ordinances. Any amendment to a proposed ordinance must be reduced to writing before the vote on the amendment. 
    Motion 13. To revive consideration. The council may vote to revive consideration of any substantive motion that has been deferred pursuant to Motion 8, provided it does so within one hundred (100) days of its vote to defer consideration. 
    Motion 14. To reconsider. The council may vote to reconsider its action on a matter, provided the motion to reconsider is made (a) at the same meeting during which the action to be reconsidered was taken and (b) by a member who voted with the prevailing side. For purposes of this motion, "the same meeting" includes any continuation of a meeting through a motion to recess to a certain time and place (Motion 3). The motion is not in order if it interrupts the council's deliberation on a pending matter. 
    Motion 15. To rescind. The council may vote to rescind an action taken at a prior meeting provided rescission is not forbidden by law. 
    Motion 16. To prevent reintroduction for six (6) months. This motion may be used to prevent the reintroduction of a failed substantive motion for a time, but it is in order only when made immediately following the substantive motion's defeat. To be adopted, this motion must receive votes equal to at least two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the council's actual membership, including the mayor, excluding vacant seats. If this motion is adopted, the ban on reintroduction remains in effect for six (6) months or until the council's next organizational meeting, whichever occurs first. 
(Ord. No. 2018-54, § 1, 10-16-18) 
Sec. 2-54. - Ordinances and contracts. 
    Rule 31. Introduction of ordinances. 
    For purposes of these rules, the "date of introduction" for a proposed ordinance is the date on which the council first votes on the proposed ordinance's subject matter. The council votes on the subject matter of a proposed ordinance when it votes on whether to adopt or make changes to the proposed ordinance. 
    Rule 32. Adoption, amendment, and repeal of ordinances. 
(a)  Adoption of ordinances. 
(1)  Proposed ordinances to be in writing. No proposed ordinance shall be adopted unless it has been reduced to writing and distributed to members before a vote on adoption is taken. 
(2)  Adoption on date of introduction. To be approved on the date of introduction, a proposed ordinance or any action having the effect of an ordinance must receive affirmative votes equal to at least two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the council's actual membership, excluding vacant seats. 
(3)  Adoption after date of introduction. To be approved after the date of introduction, a proposed ordinance or any action having the effect of an ordinance must receive affirmative votes equal to at least a majority of all council members not excused from voting on the matter. 
(b)  Amendment and repeal of ordinances. The same voting requirements that govern the adoption of proposed ordinances also apply to the amendment or repeal of an ordinance. 
    Rule 33. Adoption of the budget ordinance. 
(a)  Special rules for the adoption or amendment of the budget ordinance. Notwithstanding any provision in the city charter, general law, or local act, 
(1)  the council may adopt or amend the budget ordinance at a regular or special meeting of the council by a simple majority of those members present and voting, a quorum being present; 
(2)  no action taken with respect to the adoption or amendment of the budget ordinance need be published or is subject to any other procedural requirement governing the adoption of ordinances or resolutions by the council; and 
(3)  the adoption or amendment of the budget ordinance and the levy of taxes in the budget ordinance are not subject to the provisions of any city charter or local act concerning initiative or referendum. 
(b)  Notice requirements for budget meetings. During the period beginning with the submission of the budget to the council and ending with the adoption of the budget ordinance, the council may hold any special meetings that may be necessary to complete its work on the budget ordinance. Except for the notice requirements of the open meetings law, which continue to apply, no provision of law concerning the call of special meetings applies during that period so long as 
  each member of the board has actual notice of each special meeting called for the purpose of considering the budget and 
  no business other than consideration of the budget is taken up. 
(c)  No authority for closed sessions. This rule shall not be construed to authorize the council to hold closed sessions on any basis other than the grounds set out in Rule 5. 
    Rule 34. Approval of contracts and authorization of expenditures. 
(a)  Contracts to be in writing. No contract shall be approved or ratified by the city council unless it has been reduced to writing at the time of the council's vote. 
(b)  Approval of contracts. To be approved or ratified, a contract must receive affirmative votes equal to at least a majority of all council members not excused from voting on the contract. 
(c)  Authorization of expenditure of public funds. The same vote necessary to approve or ratify a contract is required for the council to authorize the expenditure of public funds, except when the expenditure is authorized pursuant to Rule 33. 
(Ord. No. 2018-54, § 1, 10-16-18) 
Sec. 2-55. - Public hearings and comment periods. 
    Rule 35. Public hearings. 
(a)  Calling public hearings. In addition to holding public hearings required by law, the council may hold any public hearings it deems advisable. The council may schedule hearings or delegate that responsibility to city staff members, as appropriate, except when state law directs the council itself to call the hearing. If the council delegates scheduling authority, it must provide adequate guidance to assist staff members in exercising that authority. 
(b)  Public hearing locations. Public hearings may be held anywhere within the city or within the county where the city is located. 
(c)  Rules for public hearings. The council may adopt reasonable rules for public hearings that, among other things, 
  fix the maximum time allotted to each speaker, 
  provide for the designation of spokespersons for groups of persons supporting or opposing the same positions. 
  provide for the selection of delegates from groups of persons supporting or opposing the same positions when the number of persons wishing to attend the hearing exceeds the capacity of the hall (so long as arrangements are made, in the case of a hearing subject to the open meetings law, for those excluded from the hall to listen to the hearing), and 
  provide for the maintenance of order and decorum in the conduct of the hearing. 
(d)  Notice of public hearings. Any public hearing at which a majority of the council is present shall be considered part of a regular or special meeting. Consequently, the relevant notice and related requirements of the open meetings law, as set out in Rules 9 through 12, apply to such hearings. Some statutes mandate additional notice for particular types of hearings, and such notice must be provided together with notice of the meeting during which the hearing will take place. 
(e)  Continuing public hearings. The council may continue any public hearing without further advertisement to a time and place certain, provided the time (including the date, if the hearing will resume on a different day) and place of the continued hearing are announced in open session. Except for hearings conducted pursuant to paragraph (g), if a quorum of the council is not present for a properly scheduled public hearing, the hearing must be continued until the council's next regular meeting without further advertisement. 
(f)  Conduct of public hearings. At the time appointed for the hearing, the mayor shall call the hearing to order and proceed to allow public input in accordance with any rules adopted by the council for the hearing. Unless the council extends the hearing, when the time allotted for the hearing expires, or when no one (1) wishes to speak who has not done so, the mayor shall close the hearing, and the council shall resume the regular order of business. 
(g)  Public hearings by less than a majority of council members. Nothing in this rule prevents the council from appointing a member or members to hold a public hearing on the council's behalf, except when state law requires that the council itself conduct the hearing. 
    Rule 36. Public comment periods. 
(a)  Frequency of public comment periods. The council must provide an opportunity for public comment at each regular meeting, except that the council need not offer a public comment period during any month in which it does not hold a regular meeting. 
(b)  Rules for public comment periods. The council by resolution at the organizational meeting, or at any other meeting at the discretion of the council, shall adopt reasonable rules for public comment periods that, among other things, 
  fix the maximum time allotted to each speaker, 
  provide for the designation of spokespersons for groups supporting or opposing the same positions, 
  provide for the selection of delegates from groups supporting or opposing the same positions when the number of persons wishing to attend the public comment period exceeds the capacity of the hall (so long as arrangements are made for those excluded from the hall to listen to the hearing), and 
  provide for the maintenance of order and decorum in the conduct of the hearing. 
(c)  Content-based restrictions generally prohibited. The council may not restrict speakers based on subject matter, as long as their comments pertain to subjects within the council's real or apparent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 2018-54, § 1, 10-16-18) 
Sec. 2-56. - Appointments and appointed bodies. 
    Rule 37. Appointments. 
(a)  Appointments in open session. The council must consider and make any appointment to another body or, in the event of a vacancy on the council, to its own membership in open session. 
(b)  Nomination and voting procedure. The council shall use the following procedure to fill a vacancy in the council itself or in any other body over which it has the power of appointment. The nominating committee shall be called upon to make its report and recommendation(s), if any. The mayor shall open the floor for nominations, whereupon council members may put forward and debate nominees. When debate ends, the mayor shall call the roll of the members, and each member shall cast a vote for the member's preferred nominee. The voting shall continue until a nominee receives a majority of votes cast during a single balloting. 
(c)  Mayor. The mayor may make nominations and vote on appointments under this rule. 
(d)  Multiple appointments. If the council is filling more than one (1) vacancy, each member shall have as many votes in each balloting as there are slots to be filled, and the votes of a majority of the total number of members voting shall be required for each appointment. No member may cast more than one (1) vote for the same candidate for the same vacancy during a single balloting. 
(e)  Duty to vote. It is the duty of each member to vote for as many appointees as there are appointments to be made, but failure to do so shall not invalidate a member's ballot. 
    Rule 38. Committees and boards. 
(a)  Establishment and appointment. The council may establish temporary and standing committees, boards, and other bodies to help carry on the work of city government. Unless otherwise provided by law or the council, the power of appointment to such bodies lies with the council. 
(b)  Open meetings law. The requirements of the open meetings law apply whenever a majority of an appointed body's members gather in person or simultaneously by electronic means to discuss or conduct official business. They do not apply to meetings solely among the city's professional staff. 
(c)  Council committee meetings. In accordance with G.S. 143-318.10, a duly appointed committee of the city council is a "public body" and shall be subject to all applicable open meetings requirements under state law. 
(d)  Procedural rules. The council may prescribe the procedures by which the city's appointed bodies operate, subject to any statutory provisions applicable to particular bodies. In the absence of rules adopted by the council, an appointed body may promulgate its own procedural rules, so long as they are in keeping with any relevant statutory provisions and generally accepted principles of parliamentary procedure. 
(Ord. No. 2018-54, § 1, 10-16-18) 
Sec. 2-57. - Miscellaneous. 
    Rule 39. Amendment of the rules. 
    These rules may be amended at any regular meeting or at any properly called special meeting for which amendment of the rules is one (1) of the meeting's stated purposes. Any amendment to these rules must be consistent with the city charter, any relevant statutes, and generally accepted principles of parliamentary procedure. To be adopted, a motion to amend these rules must be approved by a majority of the council's members, excluding vacant seats and counting the mayor only if the mayor may vote on all questions. 
    Rule 40. Reference to Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised. 
    The council shall refer to Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised for guidance when confronted with a procedural issue not covered by these rules or state law. Having consulted Robert's, the mayor shall make a ruling on the issue subject to appeal to the council under Rule 30, Motion 1.

    Any person determined to be in violation of any of the provisions of the chapters and/or appendices identified in section 8.5-19 shall receive a civil citation for a penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) for such violation. No penalty shall be assessed until the person alleged to be in violation has been notified of the violation by a code enforcement officer. Such notification shall be either through a personal visit, an on-premises written notification, or by certified mail. If uncorrected after the notification, a code enforcement officer who observed the violation shall issue a citation requiring the violator to pay the above-stated penalty to the city revenue department. The owner, tenant, or occupant of any building or land or part thereof or any person who participates in or acts in concert, assists, directs, creates, or maintains any condition found to be a violation shall be subject to the penalties and remedies herein provided. 
(Ord. No. 1990-68, § 1, 12-18-90; Ord. No. 1994-4, § 1, 1-4-94; Ord. No. 2010-05, § 1, 2-16-10) 
Sec. 8.5-2. - Uncorrected violations. 
(a)  When a code enforcement officer finds that a previous violation has not been corrected, he shall issue another citation requiring payment of an additional civil penalty in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00). 
(b)  After a second citation has been issued, no further civil citation shall be issued to the same person for the same continuing violation at the same location unless and until an additional written notice is delivered to the offender by personal service, registered mail or posting of the notice at the location of the violation if reasonable attempts to serve the notice are unsuccessful. The notice shall set forth the nature of the violation and order that corrective action be taken. The notice shall state that failure to correct the violation within the time specified in the notice will result in the assessment of additional civil penalties and other enforcement action. If after the specified time period has expired and corrective action has not been completed, the civil penalty shall automatically activate in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day and shall continue to be accrued at the rate of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day until the violation is corrected. The code enforcement officer shall notify the violator by personal service or certified mail of the day of the civil penalty began to accrue and shall state that the penalty will continue to accrue for each day the violation remains uncorrected. Any enforcement action for injunctive relief by the city shall not stay or abate the accruing of the civil penalty, and the penalty shall continue to accrue daily until the violation is finally corrected either voluntarily or by the city as a result of a court order. 
(Ord. No. 1990-68, § 1, 12-18-90; Ord. No. 1994-4, § 1, 1-4-94) 
Sec. 8.5-3. - Failure to pay. 
    If the civil penalty is not paid within ten (10) days after demand for payment by a code enforcement officer, the city may initiate a civil action in the nature of a debt collection to recover civil penalties which have previously accrued. Such action shall not stop further civil penalties from accruing if the violation has not been corrected.

Sec. 8.5-5. - Appeal of determination of violation. 
    A person notified of a violation may appeal such determination to the zoning board of adjustment. Such appeal must be filed with the city not later than ten (10) days after the receipt of the first notice issued pursuant to section 8.5-1. Failure to timely file an appeal shall constitute acceptance of the determination that a violation exists. If an appeal is filed, further action by the code enforcement officer shall be suspended until a ruling is issued by the board of adjustment. If the board finds that a violation exists, enforcement under this chapter shall continue despite any further appeals by the violator. The fact that an appeal is filed or pending under this chapter shall not prevent the city from pursuing other enforcement remedies allowed by law and a finding by the zoning board of adjustment that a violation does not exist shall not be binding in any other enforcement proceeding brought by the city against the same violation that the zoning board of adjustment ruled upon.

When any appeal is from a decision of the inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the board, unless the inspector certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that, by reason of the facts stated in the certificate, a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant, a suspension of his requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than one (1) day's written notice to the inspector, by the board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. 160A-446(f) and section 10-53.

a.  If, at the end of the time granted by the inspector in accordance with section 10-52(d), active efforts are being made to complete the work and at least fifty (50) percent of the work is completed, the commission can grant up to twelve (12) months additional time. 
b.  Progress reports will be made to the board within the time period prescribed by the board.

The summons and complaint shall be served as provided in G.S. 42-29. The summons shall be returned according to its tenor, and if on its return it appears to have been duly served and if at the hearing the inspector produces a certified copy of an ordinance adopted by the city council pursuant to G.S. 160A-443(5) authorizing the inspector to proceed to vacate the occupied dwelling, the magistrate shall enter judgment ordering that the premises be vacated and that all persons be removed.

Sec. 10-60. - Alternative remedies.

(Code 1977, § 12-29; Ord. No. 2001-45, § 11, 6-19-01) 
Sec. 10-61. - Regulation of vacant, neglected and abandoned residential properties. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. It is recognized by the Housing Advocacy Commission and the City Council of the City of Salisbury that there exists residential properties within the city limits that are vacant, neglected and abandoned. In a study that was completed in 2011, there were over seven hundred fifty (750) residential properties that were considered vacant and abandoned. The purpose of the following is to focus on neglected and abandoned residential properties that will continue to deteriorate into a condition that cannot be repaired if not addressed immediately. These properties are vulnerable to break-ins, criminal activity, destruction, fire and other unsafe activities. In addition, they attract and/or cause blight to surrounding properties. For these reasons, it is essential to public health, safety and welfare that the city set standards that will not allow a residential property to remain in a deteriorated or dilapidated condition for an extended period of time. 
    The housing advocacy commission recognizes the "broken window" theory as one (1) reason that this section is needed. That theory states that "one broken window, left unrepaired, leads to more broken windows as it gives the appearance that no one cares for or protects the property; that that building becomes increasingly more deteriorated, and that the deterioration may have a ripple effect on other parts of the neighborhood." 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Abandoned means a residential structure on a parcel which is: 
(1)  Vacant for thirty (30) days; 
(2)  In violation of one (1) or more minimum housing standards of the City Code; and 
(3)  The issues that are in violation have not been corrected within thirty (30) days of being noticed. 
    Neglected means a vacant residential structure that has been issued one (1) or more violations of the city nuisance and/or zoning codes within the past twelve (12) months. 
    Property, when referred to in this section of the Code, shall refer only to residential properties and not include nonresidential properties. 
    Vacant means a residential structure on a parcel which lacks the habitual presence of human beings who have a legal right to be on the premises or at which substantially all residential occupancy has ceased. 
(c)  Requirements for vacant structures. A property that is considered vacant must be kept in good condition and must meet all applicable minimum housing codes. It must also be secured as to not allow vagrants or other unwanted persons to enter the structure. If the property is not secure, a notice will be sent by certified mail or in person requiring it to be secured within fifteen (15) days of being notified. After that compliance period, the code services division shall secure the property. The cost of the same shall be the responsibility of the property owner. If securing the property involves the boarding up of any openings, section 10-62 of the City Code of Ordinances must be followed. 
(d)  Required information and guidelines for neglected and abandoned structures. A property that is considered neglected or abandoned as defined in this section is subject to the guidelines, requirements, maintenance standards and penalties as described herein. Once a property is deemed neglected or abandoned, the property owner must fill out a "statement of intent" form as provided by the code services division within fifteen (15) days of the date mailed. The following information will be collected as part of that form: 
(1)  Name of property owner. 
(2)  Phone number of property owner. 
(3)  Mailing address of property owner. 
(4)  If owner lives more than fifty (50) miles from property, a property manager (at least eighteen (18) years of age) must be listed with the same contact information required as for the owner. 
(5)  Maintenance plan from property owner showing how often the owner or property manager will physically visit the property to ensure property is kept up (grass mowed, windows and doors secured and not broken, etc.) which shall be at a minimum of every fifteen (15) days. 
(6)  Copy of most recently executed deed. 
(7)  Future plans for property (i.e., make repairs by certain date, to be used as a rental or owner occupied property, why property is in the current state that it is in). 
    The property owner shall have a continuing duty to promptly supplement the information required by the statement of intent form in the event that said information changes. 
    By submitting a statement of intent form and entering into this section does not excuse the property owner from compliance with any other applicable ordinance, regulation or statute. 
(e)  Maintenance standards for neglected and abandoned structures. A property owner or manager of a property which falls within this section shall inspect the property once every fifteen (15) days. A record of these inspections should be maintained and must be readily available if asked to provide. 
    The property owner is required to keep the exterior of the dwelling and its surrounding property in compliance with all city codes and maintained so as not to cause a negative impact on neighboring properties. 
    The property owner shall make every attempt to keep the dwelling in a condition that does not appear to be vacant and therefore an attractant to vagrants or criminal activity. 
    The property owner shall keep all vegetation on the property trimmed appropriately to deter criminal activity. This includes, but is not limited to, keeping shrubbery trimmed so it does not create a screen or blind spot for vagrants and other unwanted persons to hide behind. 
    All windows, doors and other openings shall be secure as to not allow unwanted persons to enter the dwelling. If unsecured, the code services division will secure and the cost will be the responsibility of the property owner. 
(f)  Exemptions. The code services division may exempt a property for a specific period of time that has suffered extensive fire damage or catastrophic damage. A statement of intent form must still be filled out and returned within thirty (30) days of the date mailed. Any exemption granted shall be for a specific period of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days.

The same must have obtained all necessary permits from the county or city as required and shall be proceeding diligently to completion. 
(g)  Penalties. 
(1)  Vacant structures. A property that is determined to be vacant as defined in this section which is not in violation of subsection (c) of this section or any other applicable city code is not subject to any penalties, fees or fines. 
(2)  Neglected structures. A property that is determined to be neglected as defined in this section is subject to civil penalties as set forth in section 8.5-1 of the City Code of Ordinances until all requirements, guidelines and maintenance standards have been complied with as set forth within this section. Furthermore, any violation of this section is also considered a misdemeanor as provided in G.S. 14.4 and the property owner may be fined up to five hundred dollars ($500.00). 
Once the property has not received any additional nuisance or zoning violation notices within a twelve-month period, it will be deemed compliant with this section and no longer considered neglected. If the property becomes occupied by a person or person(s), it will no longer be considered neglected but may still be considered a nuisance and will be subject to chapter 14 of the City Code. If the property becomes vacant again and violations have occurred or do occur within a twelve-month period, it will be subject to this section. All other chapters of the City Code must be followed and may be pursued in addition to the penalties in this section. 
(3)  Abandoned structures. A property that is determined to be abandoned as defined in this section is subject to all penalties as described in subsection (g)(2). Furthermore, the property must be brought into compliance with all minimum housing code violations within a time period of no more than ninety (90) days as defined by the code services division. At the end of the compliance date, any violations that have not been corrected will be abated by the code services division, or a contractor thereof. All costs will be the responsibility of the property owner and if unpaid, will result in a lien against the property. 
Once the property has not received any additional minimum housing code violation notices within a twelve-month period and has been brought into compliance with chapter 10 of the City Code, it will be deemed compliant with this section and no longer considered abandoned. Additionally, the property may not become occupied until all current violations have been brought into compliance as the property will be considered unfit for human habitation and posted as the same. Occupancy of such a property is considered a misdemeanor as provided in G.S. 14.4.

Such appeal will stay the abatement by the code services division until a final determination by the zoning board of adjustment. If no appeal is taken, the code services division may proceed to abate the issue. 
(2)  If an appeal is taken as provided in this section, the zoning board of adjustment may, after hearing all interested persons and reviewing the findings of the code services division, reverse or affirm the finding that the condition sited is a violation. If the zoning board of adjustment determines that the findings of the code services division are correct and proper, the code services division may proceed with the abatement process unless the property owner obtains a stay from the superior court.

k.  Structural supports. Every structural element of the dwelling shall be maintained in a structurally sound condition and show no evidence of deterioration which would render it incapable of carrying normal loads. Termites, termite damage, fire damage, absence of footings or cracked or split wood structural supports are examples of evidence of deterioration. When additional direct support is required, piers shall be used under girders, at walls or other primary support points. Stiff knees shall not be used under girders, at walls or at other primary support points, but may be used for indirect support only.

If the owner or registered agent is a legal entity other than a natural person, including but not limited to a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company, the mandatory initial meeting shall be attended by an officer, manager, or other individual with authority to execute the plan on behalf of the entity. 
(b)  At the mandatory initial meeting, the police official, code services official and the owner or registered agent shall, at a minimum, review the following: 
(1)  Residential rental property registration requirements; 
(2)  The data that established that the property falls above the disorder threshold; 
(3)  Any relevant evidence provided by the owner or registered agent that may establish that the unit or property does not fall at or above the disorder threshold; 
(4)  Whether or not the owner knew or should have known that the disorder activity was occurring on the property; 
(5)  Code enforcement actions. 
(c)  After reviewing all the evidence, any previously identified disorder activity that is found to not either have occurred on or in the property, or does not clearly meet the definition of a disorder activity, shall be discounted, and not considered by the code services official and police official. In the event the adjusted disorder activity results in the unit being below the disorder threshold, then no further action shall be taken and residential rental property registration shall not be required. 
(d)  In the event that the adjusted disorder activity for the unit or property results in the unit or property remaining above the disorder threshold, then the property will be designated in need of remedial action (INRA). The owner or registered agent, police official, and code services official shall develop and sign a remedial action program for the residential rental unit. A three-month review date shall be set in the remedial action program. 
(e)  In the event the owner or registered agent fails to attend the mandatory initial meeting without just cause, the police official and code services official shall review all the evidence concerning the property pursuant to subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section. Upon a finding that the adjusted disorder activity results in the residential rental unit being at or above the disorder threshold, the police official and code services official shall refer the property to the city attorney's office for determination of whether a public nuisance action as defined by Chapter 19 of the North Carolina General Statutes or any other legal or equitable remedy is warranted. 
(Ord. No. 2017-41, § 1(Exh. A), 7-11-17)

(a)  On or about the first three-month review date, the owner or registered agent, police official, and code services official shall review the disorder activity in or on the residential rental property since the date of the remedial action program and determine the disorder activity for the unit or property from the previous three-month period. If the disorder activity would no longer result in the unit being at or above the disorder threshold, then the in need of remedial action (INRA) designation shall be removed and the owner shall be issued a certificate of compliance. No further review requirements or registration shall be required. Nothing in this section prohibits the owner from voluntarily continuing the implementation of an agreed upon plan of action. 
(b)  If the unit continues to fall at or above the disorder threshold, and any required tasks or steps contained in the remedial action program have not been addressed, then the police official and code services official shall determine whether the owner has complied in good faith with the remedial action program. 
    In determining whether the owner has acted in good faith, police official and code services official shall weigh the following factors: 
(1)  Whether the owner or registered agent has regularly met with the police official and code services official as requested; 
(2)  Whether the owner has exhausted all resources reasonably available to the owner in order to comply with the terms of the remedial action program; 
(3)  Whether the owner has intentionally ignored a term of a remedial action program; 
(4)  Whether the disorder activity on the unit or property constitutes a public nuisance as defined by Chapter 19 of the North Carolina General Statutes. 
(c)  If there is clear and convincing evidence that the owner has acted in good faith to comply with the remedial action program, then the police official and code services official may amend the remedial action program as necessary and set a second three-month review date. 
(d)  If the owner is found not to have acted in good faith, then the police official and code services official shall continue the designation in need of remedial action (INRA), amend the remedial action program, and set a second three-month review date. Alternatively, the property may be referred to the city attorney's office for a determination of whether a public nuisance action under Chapter 19 of the North Carolina General Statutes or any other legal or equitable remedy is warranted. 
(Ord. No. 2017-41, § 1(Exh. A), 7-11-17) 
Sec. 14-127. - Second three-month review of remedial action program (if required). 
(a)  At the second three-month review date, the owner or registered agent, police official and code services official shall review the disorder activity in or on the unit or property since the date of the amended remedial action program and determine the disorder activity from the previous quarter. If the disorder activity no longer results in the unit or property being at or above the disorder threshold, then the in need of remedial action (INRA) designation shall be removed and the owner shall be issued a certificate of compliance. No further review requirements or registration shall be required. 
(b)  If the owner has acted in good faith, then the police official and code services official may continue to work with the owner or registered agent; however that if the unit or property continues to fall at or above the disorder threshold, then the matter shall be referred to the city attorney's office for a determination as to whether a public nuisance action under Chapter 19 of the North Carolina General Statutes or any other legal or equitable remedy is warranted.

(12)  When authorized, by regulation issued by the chief of police or his designee in other similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled as set forth in subsection (11) but adapted to reasonably necessary nighttime activities of more juveniles than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the chief of police or his designee permitting use of public places should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies such as schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the public places permitted, the period of time involved not to extend more than one (1) hour beyond the period of termination of this activity, and the reason for finding that the regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this article.

Sec. 25-62. - Cutting off water. 
(a)  The fact that the water to premises has been cut off at the property line shall not be construed to relieve the customer responsible for the payment of the bill for water supplied by the city to the premises in question from paying service charges under this article. Bills will be imposed until a request in writing or in person is received to cut the water off. 
(b)  Depending upon the circumstances of the cut-off, charges may be levied as outlined in schedule B referred to in article II of this chapter.

Sec. 25-64. - Water leakage. 
(a)  If a consumer has an underground or hidden water leak which he could not reasonably be expected to discover and which is evidenced by an unusually high utility bill, upon notification by a licensed plumber and subject to verification by a city representative as to the existence and timely repair of such an underground leak, the following corrective measures shall be taken. The consumer's average water bill will be computed on the basis of the previous six (6) billing periods immediately preceding the present bill. This average bill will be compared to the present bill and one-half (1/2) of the excess of the present amount over the average amount will be abated. For the purposes of this section, a hidden water leak is a leak in a water line which is not necessarily underground but is obscured by being underneath a structure or within the walls of a structure. It is not the intent of this section to abate any portion of a water bill for any facility leaks such as air conditioners, commodes, faucets, and those facilities subject to normal maintenance inspection. 
(b)  The consumer will have the burden of proving to the satisfaction of the director or his authorized representative that the water from the leakage did not enter the city sewer system. Upon sustaining that burden, the consumer's average sewer bill will be compared to the present bill, and the entire excess of the present amount over the average amount will be abated. The consumer's average sewer bill will be computed on the basis of the previous six (6) billing periods immediately preceding the present bill. 
(c)  Occasionally, an unusually high water bill is received by a user and upon investigation no explainable reason can be determined for the cause of the extra water and sewer use. When this situation exists, the following procedure shall be used: 
(1)  The city shall pull the water meter and check the calibration to see if the meter is accurate. 
(2)  If the meter is determined to be inaccurate, an adjustment as determined in subsection (c)(6) of this section may be made. 
(3)  If the meter is accurate, the water and sewer maintenance and construction division shall be responsible for contacting the customer to obtain all pertinent information available during the period of the high bill and also to check for possible underground leaks that might go undetected. 
(4)  If an underground leak is found, an adjustment as determined in subsections (a) and (c)(6) of this section shall be made. 
(5)  If no underground leaks are detected, the finance department shall perform an audit of the account to provide a billing history for at least the previous twelve (12) months. It may also be necessary to wait until the next month's bill is calculated to see if the bill is back within the normal range. 
(6)  If all investigations provide no reasonable, explainable reason for the high bill and if the billing history clearly shows a normal bill to be substantially less than the high bill, the director of finance or another designated person shall be authorized to review the matter and determine if an adjustment should be made. If an adjustment is approved, the adjusted bill shall be calculated on the basis of an average water and sewer bill for the six (6) months immediately preceding the high bill. This average bill will be compared to the high bill and one-half (1/2) of the excess of the high bill over the average amount will be abated. 
(7)  Only one (1) adjustment of this type shall be permitted during a twelve-month period. 
(8)  A decision by the director of finance to deny an adjustment may be appealed to the city council by the user.

    The responsibility for maintaining and repairing sewer and water service connections shall be in accord with this section and article IV of this chapter. The repair of all pipes and fixtures on private property shall be the responsibility of the property owner or consumer. When a minor failure occurs in a pipe or fixture on private property, and such failure is not corrected within twelve (12) hours of notification by the director or his designated representative to the owner or person in charge, the city, for the purpose of conserving water and protecting the public, may discontinue service until the failure is corrected or, at its discretion, may enter the property and make necessary repairs. When a major failure occurs in a line or fixture and creates the possibility of an immediate danger to the public health or safety, the city may make the necessary repairs. The work done by the city shall be limited to the necessary line repair and such backfilling as needed to protect the pipe. The cost of any repairs performed by the city shall be charged to the property owner and included in his next regular periodic water and sewer bill. Failure to pay the repair bill shall be considered as a regular water and sewer bill delinquency and service may be discontinued until such amount is paid.

Connections shall be made by the city or an approved licensed bonded plumber or utility contractor. 
(g)  Discharge of sanitary wastewater into storm sewers is prohibited without exception. Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designed as storm sewers or to a natural outlet approved by the director and the division of environmental management. Unpolluted industrial cooling water or process waters may be discharged on approval of the director and division of environmental management to a storm sewer or natural outlet and sanitary wastewater should be prohibited from discharge into the storm sewer system. 
(h)  Where existing septic tanks or package treatment plants that have been approved by the county health department or the state department of environment, health, and natural resources are located within the city, connection to the public sewer shall not be required as long as the privately owned facilities are operating properly and pose no public health threat. In addition to being an approved system, the private sewage disposal system must function at all times in a safe and satisfactory manner. The system must remain in an approved condition and not discharge sewage or effluent to the surface of the ground or contaminate any groundwater or surface water supplies. Determination of whether privately owned facilities are operating properly shall be at the discretion of the director or his designee in conjunction with representatives of the county health department. Private systems requiring major repairs such as replacement of drainfields or other work of a nonmaintenance nature shall be considered to be operating improperly and the mandatory connection provided for in subsection (a) of this section shall apply. 
(i)  Where a public sewer main is not available, a building sewer shall be connected to a private wastewater disposal system complying with all applicable state and local regulations concerning use of such systems. The city, in conjunction with the county health department, shall have the authority to approve or reject package plants or usage of private wastewater facilities presently located within or proposed for location within the corporate limits of the city. The minimum lot area that shall be approved for a private wastewater disposal system shall be as regulated by North Carolina General Statutes and the county health department.

ARTICLE VI. - BACKFLOW PREVENTION AND CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2007-11, § 1, adopted Apr. 3, 2007, amended Art. VI in its entirety, in effect deleting and reenacting Art. VI to read as set out herein. Former Art. VI pertained to backflow prevention and cross-connection control and derived from Ord No. 1995-25, § 3, adopted May 16, 1995; and Ord No. 1999-29, adopted May 18, 1999. 

Sec. 25-136. - Backflow prevention. 
(a)  Purpose: The purpose of this backflow prevention and cross-connection control ordinance is: 
(1)  To protect the public potable water supply of the city (Salisbury-Rowan Utilities) from the possibility of contamination or pollution, due to back-siphonage or backpressure, by isolating within the consumer's private water system such contaminants or pollutants, which could backflow into the public water system. 
(2)  To define the authority of the city (Salisbury-Rowan Utilities) as the water purveyor entitled to eliminate all existing cross-connections, and prevent new cross-connections, within its public water system. 
(3)  To provide a continuing inspection program. 
(4)  To comply with all applicable federal and state regulations. 
(b)  Responsibility: City of Salisbury (Salisbury-Rowan Utilities). 
(1)  Salisbury-Rowan Utilities (SRU) will be primarily responsible for preventing any contamination or pollution of the public water system. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, this responsibility begins at the point of origin of the public water supply and includes all of the public water distribution system, and ends at the service connection. The meter services supervisor, or his/her designee, shall exercise vigilance to ensure that the consumer/customer has taken the proper steps to protect the public potable water system. 
(2)  When it has been determined that a backflow prevention assembly is required or the prevention of contamination of the public water system, the meter services supervisor, or his/her designee shall notify the owner, in writing, of any such building or premises, to correct within the time specified within the written notification or two (2) years, whichever is less, any installed or existing irrigation system, connected piping, or other water systems that are in violation of this article. 
(3)  After surveying the private water system, the meter services supervisor, or his/her designee will require that an approved backflow prevention assembly be installed at or near the service connection to provide containment control. 
(4)  SRU shall notify the owner of a private water system prior to the installation of any backflow prevention assembly that said installation may create a closed system, and as a result thermal expansion may occur. Under such circumstance, the consumer/customer shall assume all liability and responsibility for that phenomenon. 
(c)  Responsibility: Consumer/customer. 
(1)  The consumer/customer is responsible for preventing contaminants and pollutants from entering the customer's private water system and the public water system operated by Salisbury-Rowan Utilities. The customer, at his own expense, shall install, operate, and maintain all backflow prevention assemblies specified within this article. 
(2)  If a tenant customer does not maintain the private water system or has no authority to bring the system into compliance with the provisions of this article Salisbury-Rowan Utilities may assert any available action against the tenant/owner to assure the private water system is brought into compliance with this article. 
(3)  SRU shall require all new water connections and any changes of use/occupation to have an approved backflow prevention assembly installed. As older connections are reviewed for compliance, hazards are identified and need is determined by the meter services supervisor, or his/her designee. The consumer/customer shall be responsible for installing backflow prevention assemblies or bringing the existing installations up to current standards. These assemblies will protect SRU's potable water supply from the possibility of contamination by isolating within its customers' private water systems contaminants or pollutants which could, under adverse conditions, backflow through uncontrolled cross-connections into the public water system. 
(4)  Consumer/customer shall be responsible for paying the cost of installation of SRU's approved backflow prevention device in SRU's meter assembly, which is included in the connection fee (SRU's backflow prevention device is installed at its discretion. However, the consumer/customer may be required to install additional private backflow prevention assemblies as per this article which are not included in the meter assembly) in accordance with Schedule B referred to in article II of this chapter.

(a)  Purposes and overview. 
(1)  Purposes. The purposes of this article include: the protection of the health, safety, and welfare; compliance with state and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 United States Code § 1251 et seq.) and the pretreatment rules of 40 CFR Part 403; the protection and efficient operation of the POTW; the issuance of wastewater discharge permits to significant industrial users and, as circumstances warrant, to other POTW users; establishment of general requirements for all POTW users; authorization of monitoring and enforcement activities; the requirement of reporting; and the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein. 
(2)  Overview. This article establishes and provides for the establishment of a pretreatment program for industrial users of the POTW and a more comprehensive POTW regulatory framework that applies to all POTW users. The pretreatment program includes all of the federally-mandated and state-mandated pretreatment program components, including a permit program for significant industrial users. In addition, the city's pretreatment program includes components that are not mandated by either the federal or state government. This article generally does not segregate the federally-mandated and state-mandated pretreatment components from the nonmandated pretreatment components or from the more comprehensive nonmandated regulatory framework. This article includes the mandated components within the pretreatment program and regulatory framework to produce a unified approach to the city's regulation and control of its POTW. The nonmandated components are not adopted for the purpose of compliance with federal or state mandates, standards, or requirements. The city's discretion in administering and enforcing nonmandated components may be the subject of state and federal input and recommendations, but should not be the subject of federal or state oversight or enforcement. 
(b)  Objectives. The objectives of this article include the following: 
(1)  To prevent the introduction into the municipal wastewater system of pollutants that will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge; 
(2)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into any waters of the state or otherwise be incompatible with the system; 
(3)  To prevent the introduction into the municipal wastewater system of flows of sufficient magnitude to cause or contribute to interference with the operation of the system or contamination of the resulting sludge or cause or contribute to pollutants passing through the system, inadequately treated, into any waters of the state or otherwise being incompatible with the system; 
(4)  To promote reuse and recycling of wastewater and of sludge from the municipal wastewater system; 
(5)  To protect both municipal personnel who may be affected by sewage, sludge, and effluent in the course of their employment as well as protecting the general public; 
(6)  To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance and improvement of the municipal wastewater system; 
(7)  To ensure that the municipality complies with its NPDES and nondischarge permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the municipal wastewater system is subject; and 
(8)  To promote the public health, safety, and welfare and the efficient and effective operation of the POTW. 
(c)  POTW director and designees. Except as otherwise provided herein, the POTW director shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article. Any powers and duties granted to or imposed upon the POTW director may be delegated by the POTW director to other city personnel. 
(1)  Authority to enter private premises. Whenever it shall be necessary for the purposes of this article, the POTW director or his designated representative upon presentation of credentials, may enter upon any property or premises at reasonable times for the purpose of: 
a.  Copying the records required to be kept under the provisions of this article; 
b.  Inspecting any monitoring equipment or method; and 
c.  Sampling any discharge of wastewater to the treatment works. 
(2)  Authority to enter for emergency response. Whenever it shall be necessary for the purposes of this article, the POTW director may enter upon any property or premises at any hour in order to respond to an emergency.

(d)  Municipalities. A municipality may be a POTW user if the municipality and city council reach mutually agreeable terms and conditions for the municipality's POTW use, the municipality enters into a city council approved written agreement with the city for POTW use, the municipality remains in compliance with the written agreement to the satisfaction of city council, and no circumstances arise that make the POTW use inappropriate as determined by city council in its sole discretion. 
(e)  Computation of time. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this article, the day of the act, event, default or publication after which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday on which city offices are closed, in which event the period shall run until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday on which city offices are closed. When the period of time is less than seven (7) days, the computation shall exclude intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays on which city offices are closed.

    The POTW director will use industrial waste survey information to develop user-specific local limits as he deems appropriate, in his discretion, to ensure that the POTW's maximum allowable headworks loading is not exceeded for particular pollutants of concern. User-specific local limits for appropriate pollutants of concern shall be included in wastewater permits, as determined appropriate by the POTW director, in his discretion. The POTW director may impose mass based local limits in addition to or in place of concentration based local limits. 
(d)  State and federal requirements. State and federal requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than requirements and limitations in this article. 
(e)  Requirements more stringent than state and federal. In addition to the local limits established by and pursuant to subsection 25-202(c), this chapter establishes and authorizes the POTW director to establish limitations, prohibitions, and other requirements that are more stringent than and in addition to those required by either state or federal rules. No industrial user or other POTW user is excused from compliance or exempt from enforcement based on a limitation, prohibition, or other requirement of this chapter being more stringent than or in addition to limitations, prohibitions, or other requirements established by state and federal rules. 
(f)  Dilution prohibition. No POTW user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards or other requirement imposed by this chapter, unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard and not prohibited by this chapter. 
(g)  Pretreatment facilities. Wastewater discharge permittees and industrial users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this article and wastewater discharge permits issued under section 25-204 and shall achieve compliance with all national categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section 25-202 of this article within the time limitations as specified by EPA, the state, or the POTW director, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the wastewater discharge permittee, industrial user, and/or owner at no expense to the city. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and there shall be no construction of the facilities unless the POTW director has granted written approval of the plans and procedures. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve a wastewater discharge permittee or an industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall not be initiated unless reported to and approved in writing by the POTW director. 
(h)  Flow control. 
(1)  Whenever deemed necessary, the POTW director may require a POTW user to restrict its discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine a POTW user's compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(2)  The POTW director may require any POTW user to install and maintain, on the POTW user's property and at the POTW user's expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.

(1)  The POTW director may require a permittee or industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under subsection 25-204(b). 
(2)  The POTW director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under subsection 25-204(b) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under subsection 25-204(b) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow or pollutant increases of twenty (20) percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load as defined in subsection 25-1(a), that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the responsible POTW user shall immediately telephone and notify the POTW director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the POTW user. 
(2)  Within five (5) days following such discharge, the POTW user shall, unless waived by the POTW director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the POTW user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the POTW user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the POTW user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(3)  Each wastewater discharge permittee shall permanently post a notice on a prominent bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (a), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(4)  A wastewater discharge permittee shall notify the POTW immediately of any change at its facility affecting the potential for spills and other accidental discharge, discharge of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load as defined in subsection 25-1(a). 
(g)  Reports from POTW users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit. All POTW users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the POTW director as the POTW director may require. If the POTW user is a nonsignificant categorical industrial user as defined in subsection 25-1(a), the appropriate reports shall include, at a minimum, the annual certification of continuing to meet the nonsignificant categorical industrial user criteria as required under 40 CFR 403.12(q). 
(h)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. 
(1)  If sampling performed by a POTW user indicates a violation, the POTW user must notify the POTW director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The POTW user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the POTW director within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. If allowed by the POTW director at the POTW director's discretion, the POTW user is not required to resample if: 
a.  The POTW director monitors the POTW user's discharge at least once a month regardless of the discovery of violations; or 
b.  Prior to the POTW user receiving the results that indicate a violation, the POTW director has already resampled the POTW user's discharge and submitted the repeat sample for analysis. 
(2)  If the POTW director has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the POTW user and the results indicate a violation, no later than thirty (30) days after receiving the results the POTW director shall repeat the sampling and submit the sample for analysis, unless: 
a.  The POTW director monitors the POTW user's discharge at least once a month regardless of the discovery of violations; or 
b.  Prior to receiving the results that indicate a violation, the POTW director has already resampled the POTW user's discharge and submitted the repeat sample for analysis; or 
c.  The POTW director has directed the POTW user to perform sampling and submit analytical results to the POTW director on or before a date that is no more than thirty (30) days after the date the POTW director became aware of the violation. 
(i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. No person may introduce into the POTW any hazardous waste without notification to and approval by the POTW director. 
(1)  Any POTW user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the POTW user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the POTW user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days before the discharge commences. The POTW user shall not begin the discharge until receiving written approval from the city. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection 25-205(e). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by POTW users under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections 25-205(a), (c), and (d). 
(2)  Industrial users are exempt from the requirements of subsection 25-205(i)(1), during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). An industrial user discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which an industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new rule under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such rule. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made by an industrial user under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This subsection 25-205(i) does not create any right or authorization to introduce into the POTW any substance and does not identify any circumstance in which the POTW director is required to approve any introduction of a hazardous waste into the POTW. 
(j)  General sampling and analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, the results of which will be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA and the city. Analyses must be performed by a state certified lab for each parameter analyzed, if such certification exists for that parameter. 
(1)  Samples taken at location identified in a wastewater discharge permit. Every sample taken at a sampling location identified in a wastewater discharge permit shall be taken and analyzed in compliance with subsections 25-205(j) and (k). If a sample taken or an analysis conducted is not required by a wastewater discharge permit, the results of such sampling or analysis shall be summarized and reported on indirect discharge monitoring report forms, postmarked no later than the last calendar day following the month in which the samples were taken whether such results are preliminary, final, or otherwise and regardless of the type of delivery of results, whether written, oral, or otherwise. 
(2)  At the POTW director's discretion, if a substance is removed from a sample in order to eliminate laboratory interference or for any other reason, the POTW director may require the relevant POTW user to determine, to the satisfaction of the POTW director, the identity of each substance removed and the concentration of the substance in the sample from which it was removed. 
(k)  Sample collection requirements. 
(1)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the POTW user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a POTW user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the POTW user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(2)  Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other pollutants as required by 40 CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the number of grabs necessary to be representative of the POTW user's discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5) for additional grab sample number requirements for baseline monitoring reports and ninety-day compliance reports. Additionally, the POTW director may allow collection of multiple grabs during a twenty-four-hour period which are composited prior to analysis as allowed under 40 CFR 136. 
(3)  Composite samples: All wastewater composite samples shall be collected with a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW director. When authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented. 
(l)  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(m)  Record keeping. POTW users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the POTW user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation in which the records may be relevant or where the POTW user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the POTW director. 
(n)  Electronic reporting. The POTW director may develop procedures for receipt of electronic reports for any reporting requirements of this article. Such procedures shall comply with 40 CFR Part 3. These procedures shall be enforceable under section 25-208. 
(Ord. No. 2013-35, § 3, 8-20-13) 
Sec. 25-206. - City access for monitoring, inspection, and sampling. 
(a)  Monitoring facilities. Wastewater discharge permittees shall provide and operate at their own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on a wastewater discharge permittees's own premises but the city, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on a wastewater discharge permittee, may allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the wastewater discharge permittee. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of the city and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following written notification by the city that the sampling and monitoring facilities are required. 
(b)  Inspection and sampling. The city will inspect the facilities of any POTW user to ascertain whether the purposes and objectives of this article are being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city, approval authority and EPA or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The city, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on a POTW user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a POTW user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the POTW user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the city's, division of water resources', or EPA's access to the POTW user's premises shall be a violation of this article. Unreasonable delays shall constitute denial of access. 
(c)  Search warrants. If the city, division of water resources, or EPA has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article, including compliance with any permit or order issued under this article, or to protect the public health, safety and welfare, then the city, division of water resources, or EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from a court having jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 2013-35, § 3, 8-20-13) 
Sec. 25-207. - Confidential information. 
(a)  Information and data provided by a POTW user to the POTW director pursuant to this article identifying the nature and frequency of a discharge, shall be available to the public without restriction. All other information which may be so submitted by a POTW user to the POTW director in connection with any required reports shall also be available to the public unless: the POTW user or other interested person specifically identifies the information as confidential upon submission and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the POTW director that the disclosure of such information or a particular part thereof to the general public would divulge methods or processes entitled to protection as trade secrets; or the information is required by G.S. ch. 132 to be protected from disclosure. 
(b)  Unless prohibited by G.S. ch. 132, information provided by a POTW user to the POTW director that is determined to be entitled to confidential treatment shall be made available upon written request to the division of water resources or any state agency for uses related to the pretreatment program, the NPDES permit, collection system permit, stormwater permit, and/or nondischarge permit, and for uses related to judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. 
(c)  Information and data received by the division of water resources or other state agency under subsection 25-207(b) shall be subject to the applicable processes set forth in G.S. 143-215.3C and the requirements of G.S. ch. 132. 
(Ord. No. 2013-35, § 3, 8-20-13) 
Sec. 25-208. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Administrative remedies. 
(1)  Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW director finds that any POTW user has violated or is violating this article, the POTW director may serve upon such a person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. The POTW director may require within thirty (30) days from the date of this notice or shorter period of time specified in the notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city by the POTW user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. The service of a notice of violation is not a prerequisite to the assessment of a civil penalty under subsection 25-208(b) or to any other enforcement action nor is any action or inaction by the POTW director under this subsection 25-208(a)(1) subject to an administrative appeal under section 25-210. 
(2)  Consent orders. The POTW director may, at his discretion, enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with a person responsible for noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the person to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order issued pursuant to [subsection] 25-208(a)(4). 
(3)  Show cause hearing. The POTW director may order any POTW user who has violated this article to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the POTW director determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served on the POTW user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the POTW user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
The POTW director shall review the evidence presented at the hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate. 
A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to the assessment of a civil penalty under subsection 25-208(b) or any other enforcement action except for the following: termination of wastewater discharge permit or termination of permission to discharge as provided in subsection 25-208(a)(6). Action or inaction by the POTW director under this subsection 25-208(a)(3) is not subject to an administrative appeal under section 25-210. 
(4)  Administrative orders. When the POTW director finds that a POTW user has violated or continues to violate this article, the POTW director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct the responsible person to do any of the following: 
a  Immediately comply with all requirements; 
b.  Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in the order; 
c.  Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a continuing or threatened violation; 
d.  Disconnect water and sewer service unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified time period. 
(5)  Emergency suspensions. The POTW director may suspend a POTW user's sewer service or wastewater discharge permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any condition of its NPDES or nondischarge permit. 
Any POTW user notified of a suspension of sewer service or wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate any and all discharges to the POTW. A hearing will be held within fifteen (15) days of the notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted. Prior to the date of the hearing, the POTW user shall submit to the POTW director a detailed written statement describing the causes of the conditions that prompted the suspension and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with a suspension order, the POTW director shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW or endangerment to any individuals. The POTW director shall reinstate a wastewater discharge permit or sewer service upon proof satisfactory to the POTW director of the elimination of the conditions that prompted the suspension. 
(6)  Termination of wastewater discharge permit or permission to discharge. The POTW director may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
a.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of a discharge; 
b.  Failure to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
c.  Refusal of reasonable access to the POTW user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; 
d.  Failure to timely pay for water or sewer service; or 
e.  Other violation of this article or any applicable state and federal regulations. 
POTW users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater discharge permit or permission to discharge and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection 25-208(a)(3) why the proposed action should not be taken. 
(b)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  If the POTW director finds that a POTW user has failed to comply with this article, including failure to comply with an order, rule, or permit issued hereunder, the POTW director may assess a civil penalty of up to twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per day per violation. 
(2)  In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the POTW director shall consider the following: 
a.  The degree and extent of the harm to the natural resources, to the public health, or to public or private property resulting from the violation; 
b.  The duration and gravity of the violation; 
c.  The effect on ground or surface water quantity or quality or on air quality; 
d.  The cost of rectifying the damage; 
e.  The amount of money saved by noncompliance; 
f.  Whether the violation was committed willfully or intentionally; 
g.  The prior record of the violator in complying or failing to comply with the pretreatment program; 
h.  The costs of enforcement to the city. 
(3)  Appeals of civil penalties assessed in accordance with this section shall be as provided in section 25-210. 
(c)  Other available remedies. Remedies provided by statute, rule, or ordinance, are available to the POTW director who may use any single one (1) or combination against a noncompliant POTW user. Available remedies include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Criminal penalties. The district attorney for the applicable judicial district may, at the request of the city, bring criminal prosecutions alleging violation of the provisions of G.S. 143-215.6B, the provisions of which, among other things, make it a crime to: negligently violate any term, condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit, or negligently fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by local governments (G.S. 143-215.6B(f)), to knowingly and willfully violate any term, condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit, or knowingly and willfully fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by local governments (G.S. 143-215.6B(g)), to knowingly violate any term, condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit issued by local governments, or knowingly fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, knowing at the time that a person is placed in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury, (G.S. 143-215.6B(h)), and to falsify information required under article 21 of chapter 143 of the General Statutes (G.S. 143-215.6B(i)). Other criminal prosecutions may also be brought at the request of the city pursuant to state laws and this Code of Ordinances. 
(2)  Injunctive relief. Whenever a POTW user is in violation of this article, including violation of an order or permit issued under this article, the POTW director, through the city attorney, may petition the superior court of justice for the issuance of a restraining order or a preliminary and permanent injunction which restrains the violation of this article or compels compliance with this article. 
(3)  Water service severance. Whenever a POTW user is in violation of this article, including an order or permit issued under this article, water service to the POTW user may be severed and service will only recommence, at the POTW user's expense, after the POTW user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the POTW director that the POTW user has established compliance with this article. 
(4)  Public nuisances. Any violation of the prohibitions or effluent limitations of this article, including violation of a permit or order issued under this article, is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the POTW director. Any person creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the ordinances of the city except the appeals procedures of chapter 14 and shall be subject to the laws of North Carolina governing such nuisances. Any person creating a public nuisance shall reimburse the city for any costs incurred by the city in removing, abating or remedying such nuisance. 
(d)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Code and in this chapter are not exclusive. The POTW director may take any, all, or any combination of enforcement actions against a noncompliant POTW user. 
(e)  Enforcement response plan. If an enforcement action is brought against an industrial user, the enforcement will generally follow the current enforcement response plan approved by the POTW director and the division of water resources. 
(f)  Penalties for falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes a false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article or a wastewater discharge permit, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) or by imprisonment for up to one (1) year, or both. 
(Ord. No. 2013-35, § 3, 8-20-13) 
Sec. 25-209. - Annual publication of significant noncompliance. 
    At least annually, the POTW director shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW, a list of those industrial users which were found to be in significant noncompliance, also referred to as reportable noncompliance, in 15A NCAC 2H .0903(b)(10), with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements, during the previous twelve (12) months. Industrial users included on the list shall be each significant industrial user that meets one (1) or more of the following criteria (1) through (8) and each industrial user that meets one (1) or more of the criteria (3), (4), or (8): 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter (not including flow) during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR Part 403.3(1); 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR Part 403.3(1) multiplied by the applicable TRC; TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease, 1.2 for all other pollutants (except flow and pH); 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by 40 CFR Part 403.3(1) (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the POTW director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public); 
(4)  Any discharge of a pollutant or wastewater that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in either the POTW director's exercise of emergency authority under 40 CFR part 403.8(f)(1)(vi)(B) and subsection 25-208(a)(5) to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Violations of compliance schedule milestones, contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order, for starting construction, completing construction, and attaining final compliance by ninety (90) days or more after the schedule date. 
(6)  Failure to provide reports for compliance schedule, self-monitoring data, baseline monitoring reports, ninety-day compliance reports, and compliance reports within forty-five (45) days from the due date. 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance. 
(8)  Any other violation or group of violations that the POTW director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 2013-35, § 3, 8-20-13) 
Sec. 25-210. - Appeals of permits, penalties, and orders. 
    This section 25-210 prescribes the requirements and process for appeals by certain petitioners of certain actions, as follows: appeal by a wastewater discharge permit applicant of permit denial pursuant to section 25-204; appeal by a wastewater discharge permittee of permit issuance or modification pursuant to section 25-204; appeal by a person against whom a civil penalty is assessed pursuant to section 25-208; and appeal by a person against whom an administrative order is issued pursuant to section 25-208. 
(a)  Timely written demand required. No petitioner shall have a right to an adjudicatory hearing under this section 25-210 except by delivering to the POTW director written demand for an adjudicatory hearing, identifying the specific issues to be contested, no later than thirty (30) days following receipt by petitioner of the wastewater discharge permit, civil penalty assessment, or administrative order that is the subject of the appeal.

Sec. 25-211. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset. 
(1)  Reserved. 
(2)  An industrial user may establish upset as an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards by demonstrating, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset and, if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days after oral notice: 
1.  A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(3)  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(4)  Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(5)  Industrial users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  Reserved. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  A POTW user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause a violation of subsections 25-202(a), (b), (c), (f), or (h) or of any federal or state pretreatment standards or requirements, but only if the bypass is required for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. Bypasses identified by this subsection 25-211(c)(1) are not subject to the provisions of subsections 25-211(c)(2)-(3). 
(2)  Notice to POTW director. 
a.  If a POTW user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW director. If possible, such notice shall be given at least ten (10) days prior to the bypass. 
b.  A POTW user shall submit oral notice to the POTW director of an unanticipated bypass no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the POTW user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of this time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(3)  Bypasses that are generally not subject to enforcement. 
a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW director may take an enforcement action against a POTW user for a bypass, unless the POTW director determines that: 
1.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life or personal injury or to prevent severe property damage which shall include substantial physical damage to property, damage to a POTW user's treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass, but shall not include economic loss caused by delays in production or any other factor not specifically listed in this subsection 25-211(c)(3)a.1; 
2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
3.  The POTW user submitted notices as required under [subsection] 25-211(c)(2). 
b.  The POTW director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW director determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection 25-211(c)(3)a.

If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3) years. 
    Failure to provide notice of a release as provided above is a violation of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2007-01, § 13, 2-6-07) 
Sec. 25-264. - Violations, enforcement, and penalties. 
(a)  Violations. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this article. Any person who has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this article, may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section or may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law. 
    In the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, the city is authorized to enter upon the subject private property, without giving prior notice, to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. The city is authorized to seek costs of the abatement as outlined in section 25-267. 
(b)  Warning notice. When the city finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, the city may serve upon that person a written warning notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a warning notice. 
(c)  Notice of violation. Whenever the city finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, the city may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. 
    The notice of violation shall contain: 
(1)  The name and address of the alleged violator; 
(2)  The address when available or a description of the building, structure or land upon which the violation is occurring, or has occurred; 
(3)  A statement specifying the nature of the violation; 
(4)  A description of the remedial measures necessary to restore compliance with this article and a time schedule for the completion of such remedial action;

(7)  A statement specifying that, should the violator fail to restore compliance within the established time schedule, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator. 
    Such notice may require without limitation: 
(1)  The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; 
(2)  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 
(3)  That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist; 
(4)  The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards; 
(5)  The restoration of any affected property; 
(6)  Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and 
(7)  The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. 
(d)  Emergency cease and desist orders. When the city finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that the person's violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the city may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
    Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this subsection shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The city may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this article. A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator. 
(e)  Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this article, the city may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc. 
(f)  Suspension of MS4 access. 
(1)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city for a reconsideration and hearing. 
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the city.

ARTICLE III. - CABLE TELEVISION SERVICES[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2002-78, adopted Dec. 3, 2002, set out provisions for use as §§ 34-81 through 34-201. For purposes of clssification, and at the editor's discretion, with the concurrence of the city, these provisions have been included as Art. III, §§ 26-81 through 26-149. 

Sec. 26-81. - Statement of intent and purpose. 
(a)  The City of Salisbury, North Carolina, pursuant to applicable federal and state law, is authorized to grant one or more nonexclusive franchises to construct, operate, maintain, and reconstruct cable systems within the incorporated areas of the city. 
(b)  The city council finds that cable service has become an integral part of its citizens' lives, and that evolving cable systems have the potential to play an even more dramatic role in the future, providing great benefits and advanced capabilities to the city. At the same time, the council further finds that the public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers that are vested in the city or such persons as the city designates. 
(c)  In order to ensure that the city and its residents receive state-of-the-art cable services and capabilities as this technology further evolves, all franchises granted pursuant to this article will be subject to periodic review and modifications to keep current with changing law, technology, and services. It is the intent of this article to help ensure that local cable operators provide the best possible cable service to residents of the city, and any franchises issued pursuant to this article shall be deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof. 
(d)  Further, it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to provide entertainment and information services to the city's residents, and may have the capacity to provide a variety of broadband, interactive communications services to institutions and individuals. For these purposes, the following goals underlie the regulations contained herein: 
(1)  Cable television services should be made available to all of the city's residents at the lowest reasonable cost. 
(2)  The system should be capable of accommodating both the present and reasonably foreseeable future state-of-the-art cable television needs of the city. 
(3)  The systems authorized by this article shall be responsive to the needs and interests of the local community, and shall provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and services to the public. 
(4)  Each of the above-enumerated goals shall be sought to the maximum extent, taking into account the costs and benefits to the residents of the city. 
(e)  The council further finds that on-going industry consolidation could result in less local accountability, and that, therefore, stringent customer service standards, including liquidated damages provisions, may be the only practical means of ensuring compliance and approximating the costs of franchise agreement non-compliance to the city and its residents.

(d)  Grantee's rights are subject to the police powers of the city to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to the health, safety, and welfare of the public. Grantee shall comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the city pursuant to that power. 
(e)  The provisions of this article shall apply to all franchises granted or renewed after the effective date of this article. This article shall also apply to all existing franchises, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of any such franchise or applicable law. In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of a franchise agreement and the provisions of this article, and other generally applicable regulatory ordinances of the city, the specific terms of the franchise agreement shall control. A franchise agreement (including all of grantee's particular rights, powers, protections, privileges, immunities and obligations associated therewith as the same exist on the date hereof) shall constitute a legally binding contract between the city and grantee, and as such, cannot be amended, modified or changed by the city without the consent of grantee in any manner whatsoever, whether by ordinance, rule, regulation or otherwise, to impose on grantee more stringent or burdensome requirements or conditions; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall preclude the city from the proper exercise of its police powers, or its powers of eminent domain. 
(f)  In the event of a change in state or federal law which by its terms would require the city to amend this article, the parties shall modify the existing franchise in a mutually agreed upon manner. 
(g)  Grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this article or a franchise agreement by reason of any failure of the city to enforce prompt compliance.

(2)  Grantee recognizes, unless otherwise agreed in the applicable franchise agreement, the right of the city to adopt such additional regulations of general applicability as it shall find necessary in the exercise of its police power. 
(c)  Every franchise agreement shall contain such further conditions or provisions as may be negotiated between the city and a grantee, except that no such conditions or provisions shall be such as to conflict with any provisions of state or federal law. In case of any conflict or of any ambiguity between any terms or provisions of a franchise agreement and this article, the provisions of the franchise agreement shall control. 
(Ord. No. 2002-78, § 1, 12-3-02)

(Ord. No. 2002-78, § 1, 12-3-02) 
Sec. 26-94. - Grant of additional franchise and competing service. 
    Competing or overlapping franchises may have an adverse impact on the public rights-of-way and on the quality and availability of services to the public. In considering whether to grant one or more additional Franchises, the city shall specifically consider, and address in a written report or in provisions of the franchise agreement, the following issues: 
(1)  The positive and/or negative impact of an additional franchise on the community. 
(2)  The ability and willingness of the specific applicant in question to provide cable services to the franchise area. 
(3)  The amount of time it will take the applicant to complete construction of the proposed system and activate service in the franchise area; and, whether the applicant can complete construction and activation of its system in a timely manner. 
(4)  The financial capabilities of the applicant and its guaranteed commitment to make the necessary investment to erect, maintain, and operate the proposed cable system for the duration of the franchise term. In order to ensure that any prospective grantee does have the requisite current financial capabilities, the city may request equity and debt financing commitment letters, current audited financial statements, bonds, letters of credit, or other documentation to demonstrate to the city's satisfaction that the requisite funds to construct and operate the proposed system are available. 
(5)  The quality and technical reliability of the proposed system, based upon the applicant's plan of construction and the method of distribution of signals, and the applicant's technical qualifications to construct and operate such system. 
(6)  The experience of the applicant in the erection, maintenance, and operation of a cable system. 
(7)  The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate one or more additional cable systems and the potential disruption of those public rights-of-way and private property that may occur if one or more additional franchises are granted. 
(8)  The likelihood and ability of the applicant to continue to provide competing cable service to subscribers within the franchise area for the duration of the franchise. 
(9)  Such other information as the city may deem appropriate to be considered prior to granting any competing or overlapping franchise.

(Ord. No. 2002-78, § 1, 12-3-02) 
Sec. 26-95. - Permits for non-franchised entities. 
(a)  The city may issue a license, easement, or other permit to a person other than the grantee to permit that person to traverse any portion of the grantee's franchise area within the city in order to provide service outside, but not within the city. Such license or easement, absent a grant of a franchise in accordance with this article, shall not authorize nor permit said person to provide cable service to any subscriber within the city nor render any other service within the city. 
(b)  The granting of such license, easement or permit shall be conditioned upon the payment of fee for occupancy of the public right-of-way to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 2002-78, § 1, 12-3-02) 
Sec. 26-96. - Review for competition. 
    The city recognizes that the cable television and telecommunications industries are in a period of convergence, that the technologies and services provided by these industries are rapidly changing, and that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 promoted and encouraged competition between and among these formally discrete industries. At this time it is premature to know fully the extent to which there will be changes in law, technology or services that may impact entities that have been or may be granted franchises or licenses to use the city's rights-of-way. It is the desire of the city to be a communications friendly city that encourages the development of competitive advanced communications capabilities for the benefit of all its citizens. For this reason the regulatory ordinances and franchises of the city should not impede or restrict the fair opportunity to compete, but rather are intended to provide uniform and consistent requirements for all similarly situated providers.

(b)  All applicants for an initial franchise grant shall submit an application fee of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) to compensate the city for its costs in reviewing, preparing and awarding a franchise, including the costs of outside consultants. Upon grant of a franchise the city may request the payment of an additional fee to the extent that the reasonable costs of the franchise review and negotiation process exceed the initial application fee amount. Consistent with the Cable Act, all such fees shall not constitute or be credited towards a grantee's franchise fee obligations. Reasonable costs include staff time, professional fees, and administrative costs as determined by the city to be necessary. 
(c)  The city reserves the right, unless prohibited by applicable law, to require a grantee to pay the reasonable costs of the franchise renewal and negotiation process. Reasonable costs include staff time, professional fees, and administrative costs determined by the city to be necessary and generally will not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00).

(Ord. No. 2002-78, § 1, 12-3-02) 
Sec. 26-116. - Service area and line extension policy. 
(a)  No grantee may discriminate in the build-out of its system to a particular area of the city in providing service to an individual or groups of residents on the basis of race, creed, religion or economic condition. Unless the franchise agreement provides otherwise, every grantee shall serve all areas of the city equally with populations of at least twenty (20) residential dwelling units per cable mile as measured from a grantee's existing distribution system, including areas annexed subsequent to the grant of the franchise. The franchise agreement shall provide a schedule of the areas to be served, and the specific build-out requirements of the grantee, and shall also describe the process for extending service to areas that will meet minimum density requirements at some future date. Unless the franchise agreement provides otherwise, every grantee shall extend service to commercial areas at no additional cost where the cost to do so does not exceed the same cost of providing service in a residential area with a density of twenty (20) homes per mile. 
(b)  During the initial construction phase of a new system, a grantee may implement its system in stages pursuant to a schedule and line extension policy established in its franchise agreement that serves all areas of the city equally, provided that any deviation from the service and line extension requirements of this article do not discriminate between different areas of the city on the basis of race, creed, religion or economic condition. A grantee of any such new franchise shall comply with all customer service obligations with respect to customers whose premises are passed by portions of the grantee's network which are fully activated, tested and available for service. 
(c)  Cost sharing. In areas with less than twenty (20) homes per proposed cable mile, grantee shall offer a cost-sharing arrangement to residents. Grantee shall bear its pro rata share of the current construction costs based upon the actual number of homes per mile. The cost-sharing arrangement shall consist of the following. On the request of a resident desiring service, grantee shall prepare, at its cost, an engineering survey and cost analysis to determine the cost of the plant extension required to provide service to the resident from the closest usable point on the cable system. The cost of construction shall be allocated based on the following formula. If a request for extension into a residential area requires the construction of cable plant which does not pass at least twenty (20) homes per cable mile, a proportionate share of construction costs shall be borne by grantee and by the subscribers. For example, if there are ten (10) dwelling units per mile. Grantee's share will equal 10/20ths of the construction cost. The remaining cost will be shared equally by each subscriber in the area to be constructed. The line extension formula shall also be applied to a portion of a cable mile meeting proportionate density requirements. For example, if there are ten (10) dwelling units per one-hall mile, the grantee shall construct the plant. The cost sharing described above would be utilized if there were less than the proportionate share of dwelling units per the portion of a mile needed to reach the dwelling units. Should additional subscribers request cable service, subscribers utilizing the cost-sharing plan for extension shall be reimbursed pro-rata for their contribution or a proportional share thereof. In such case, the pro-rata shares shall be recalculated and each new subscriber shall pay the new pro-rata share, and all prior subscribers shall receive refunds. In any event, at the end of twenty-four (24) months from completion of the project, the subscribers are no longer eligible for refunds, and the amounts paid by subscribers will be credited to the plant account of the grantee. The average cost of the line extension shall be recalculated annually based upon the current costs of labor and material. Each subscriber contributing toward the direct cost of the line extension shall waive all ownership interest in the line extension. All equipment and components of the line extension, including, but not limited to, cable wire, electronics and pedestals shall at all times remain the exclusive property of the grantee.

Sec. 26-125. - Underground installation.

City agrees to treat the maps as proprietary information to the extent provided under law, or as may be indicated in city ordinances. 
(c)  Grantee shall provide a contact number for the city to call in emergency situations requiring an immediate response on the part of the city.

Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief report by a grantee showing the basis for the computation and a "franchise fee worksheet" listing all of the sources of revenues attributable to the operation of grantee's system in the city. All such payments shall be certified as correct by an officer of the grantee. 
(c)  No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim grantor may have for further sums payable under the provisions of this article or a franchise agreement. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by grantor or its designee at any time during any calendar year (but not more than once per calendar year) upon twenty (20) calendar days notice, which shall include a request for any documents sought to be reviewed. Audits shall be at the expense of the grantee if the additional amount due is greater than two (2) percent of the amount paid. Any additional amount due to the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within sixty (60) days following written notice to the grantee by the city which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. Grantor's right to audit and grantee's obligation to retain records related to the franchise fee audit shall expire three (3) years from the date on which the most recent franchise fee payment by the grantee was due from the time of written notice of request of audit. 
(d)  In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified herein, grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the cty's primary depository bank during the period that such unpaid amount is owed.

Sec. 26-132. - Security fund. 
    Each grantee shall maintain a security fund with the city to ensure compliance with this article and the applicable franchise agreement, in an amount and in a manner as set forth in the grantee's franchise agreement. 
(Ord. No. 2002-78, § 1, 12-302) 
Sec. 26-133. - Penalties procedure. 
(a)  Whenever grantor has reason to believe that a grantee has violated any material provision of a franchise agreement or this article, grantor shall first notify the grantee of the material violation and demand correction within a reasonable time, which shall not be less than twenty (20) days in the case of the failure of a grantee to pay any sum or other amount due the grantor under a franchise agreement, and thirty (30) days in all other cases. If a grantee fails to correct the violation within the time prescribed, or if a grantee is unable to correct the violation and fails to commence corrective action within the time prescribed and to diligently remedy such violation thereafter, the grantee shall then be given written notice of not less than twenty (20) days for public comment. Said notice shall indicate with reasonable specificity the violation alleged to have occurred. 
(b)  At the public hearing, the council shall hear and consider all relevant evidence and thereafter render findings and a decision based upon the evidence. Any such hearing must, at a minimum, provide the grantee a full and fair opportunity to be heard by the council. 
(c)  In the event the council finds that a grantee has corrected the violation or promptly commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from grantor and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy the violation, or that no violation has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate and no penalty or other sanction shall be imposed. 
(d)  In the event the council finds that a violation exists and that a grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or did not promptly commence and diligently proceed to correct the violation, the council may impose liquidated damages to be collected from the security fund, as set out in the franchise agreement. 
(e)  If the council elects to assess liquidated damages, then such election shall constitute grantor's exclusive remedy for a period of sixty (60) days. Thereafter, if a grantee remains in non-compliance, the grantor may pursue any other available remedy. 
(f)  In the event that a franchise is cancelled or terminated by reason of the default of a grantee, the security fund deposited pursuant to a franchise agreement shall remain in effect and available to the grantor until all pending claims or penalties are resolved or settled, after which point any remaining amounts in the security fund shall revert to the grantee. 
(g)  The rights reserved to grantor with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of grantor, whether reserved by a franchise agreement, this article, or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right grantor may have. 
(h)  In instances of repeated violations, whether remedied or not, the grantor shall serve special notice outlining additional remediation requirements. Failure to cure, as measured by repeated instances of the same violation, is evidence of an evasive practice and may lead to revocation under Division 8. 
(i)  Grantee acknowledges that non-compliance with the provisions of the franchise agreement and the this article will harm subscribers and the city and the amounts of actual damages will be difficult or impossible to ascertain. The city may therefore assess the following liquidated damages against grantee for unexcused non-compliance with the requirements of the franchise agreement and this article. Grantee acknowledges that the liquidated damages set forth below are a reasonable approximation of actual damages and that this provision is intended to provide compensation and is not a penalty. All damages provided shall be cumulative, unless expressly stated. 
(1)  For failure to materially complete construction or extend service in accordance with the article and the franchise agreement: two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)/calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
(2)  For failure to materially comply with requirements for public access channels: two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
(3)  For failure to comply with the material requirements of the I-Net provisions of the article/franchise agreement: two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)/calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
(4)  For repeated, willful or continuing failure to submit reports, maintain records, provide documents or information: two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)/calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
(5)  For failure to comply with the material requirements of the customer service standards: two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)/calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
(6)  For failure to comply with the transfer provisions: two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)/calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
(7)  For violation of other material provisions of the article and the franchise agreement: up to two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)/calendar day for each day the violation continues.

(a)  Whenever grantor has reason to believe that there may be grounds for revocation of a franchise, grantor shall first notify the grantee in writing of its basis for believing grounds for revocation exist. Such notice shall indicate with reasonable specificity the grounds for revocation that are believed to exist so that the grantee may have a reasonable opportunity to cure or otherwise address the same. If a grantee fails to adequately cure or address the purported grounds for revocation within thirty (30) days of such notice, then the grantor may, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the grantee, commence a public administrative hearing to determine whether there exists any ground for revocation. 
(b)  The administrative hearing shall be conducted so as to protect the full due process rights of the parties and provide for, at a minimum, the right to have counsel, the right to call and cross examine witnesses, and the right to a full transcript of the proceedings.

(a)  No grantee shall sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet, or dispose of, in whole or in part, an interest in or control of a franchise or cable system or any of the rights of privileges granted by a franchise agreement, without the prior consent of the grantor, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed and may be denied only upon a good faith finding by the grantor that the proposed transferee lacks the legal, technical, or financial qualifications to consummate the transaction and operate the system so as to perform its obligations under this article and the applicable franchise agreement. This section shall not apply to sales of property or equipment in the normal course of business. Consent from the grantor shall not be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, or for a transfer to a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a grantee.

Failure to provide all information reasonably requested by the city as part of its review may be grounds for a denial of the proposed transfer. If the city fails to render a final decision on the request within one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt by the city of all required information, such request shall be deemed granted unless the grantee and the city agree to an extension of the one hundred twenty (120) day period. 
(d)  The consent or approval of the city to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the city in and to the rights-of-way and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this article and the franchise agreement. 
(e)  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city will not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion of construction of the proposed initial system.

The governing board of the taxing city has the same authority to waive the penalties for a room occupancy tax that the secretary of revenue has to waive the penalties for state sales and use taxes. 
(1)  Failure to file return. In case of failure to file any return on the date it is due, determined with regard to any extension of time for filing, the city finance officer shall assess a penalty equal to five (5) percent of the amount of the tax if the failure is for not more than one (1) month, with an additional five (5) percent for each additional month, or fraction thereof, during which the failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five (25) percent in the aggregate, or five dollars ($5.00), whichever is the greater.

Chapter 1. PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
1.1 Official Title and Map
This Ordinance is officially titled as the
Land Development Ordinance of the City
of Salisbury, North Carolina, and shall be
known as the LDO. The official map
designating the various zoning districts shall
be titled the City of Salisbury Land
Development District Map, and shall be
known as the District Map.
1.2 Purpose
This Ordinance seeks to implement the
policy recommendations of the Salisbury
Vision 2020 Comprehensive Plan as adopted by the Salisbury City Council on March 20, 2001.
This document establishes the collective vision of how the citizens of Salisbury would like to
have their city look and function by the year 2020:
? Small Town Character and Community Identity: We see Salisbury as a distinct urban enclave,
bordered in several directions by farms, open fields, and woodlands. As we approach the city limits, we note
the dramatic change in character from the rural countryside to the urban streetscape (landscaped central
median, overarching street trees, attractive streetlights) of Salisbury. We appreciate the architecture that is
unique to historic Salisbury, free of the plastic, fast food franchise architecture prevalent in so many other
communities.
? Getting Around: We see a community with "full-service streets" in which cars and pedestrians, bicyclists
and buses are equally at home. We see streets with ample sidewalks, large trees reaching over the street, and
attractive pedestrian-scaled streetlights. We see well-planned neighborhoods, designed to encourage walking
from home to work, from home to the corner store, or from home to the transit stop.
? Environmental Quality: We see a community with clean air, made possible by less dependence upon the
automobile, and the recruitment of environmentally compatible industry. Compared to other communities, we
see more people walking, biking, or taking the bus. Our city is designed to cause less traffic congestion and
require shorter commutes. We have well controlled storm water runoff with less pollution in our streams due
to our smaller, landscaped parking areas and compact two and three story commercial areas.
? Community Appearance: We see a community of clean, tree-lined streets, subtle commercial signage,
and buildings of architectural distinction nestled amidst properly designed and well-maintained landscaping.
We see smaller parking areas with cars tucked behind landscaped walls and hedges or parked to the rear of
buildings. East Innes Street has been transformed into a grand, landscaped boulevard from the I-85
interchange to the downtown. Jake Alexander Boulevard and Main Street have been developed in similar
grand fashion.
? Historic Preservation: We see the entire community, from school-aged children to senior citizens, with a
keen appreciation for Salisbury's rich history. There is constant attention and energy being poured into the
preservation and rehabilitation of the city's historic buildings and other natural resources. We see Salisbury
as a model for the state and nation, drawing visitors from far and wide to experience a living, growing
community immersed in an historic setting.
CHAPTER 1: PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
1-2
SALISBURY, NC LAND DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE
ADOPTED DECEMBER 18, 2007; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008
? Downtown Salisbury: We see a healthy, vibrant downtown with attractive streets and well-maintained
sidewalks filled with people and activity. We see a diverse array of shopping, dining, working, and cultural
amenities housed in historic buildings. We see a downtown which is the social and cultural center of the
community, and the first place where we want to take visitors. At night, we see streets filled with people and
activity and the lights on in upper story apartment windows throughout the downtown area.
? Neighborhoods: We see safe, secure, peaceful neighborhoods in every part of the city, with litter-free
streets, manicured lawns and lush gardens. We see freshly painted homes with neighbors greeting neighbors on
sidewalks and front porch swings. We see families pushing baby carriages to nearby parks. We see children
riding their bikes to the neighborhood corner store for a loaf of bread or a Saturday afternoon ice cream.
? Public Safety: We see a community of neighbors and business owners committed to community based
policing. We see police officers on the beat, getting to know the neighborhood kids, and their parents. We see
a police department which is committed to supporting the collective will and determination of the people to
have a community free of drugs, violence and crime.
? Housing: We see a multitude of housing choices, ranging from single-family homes, to townhouses, to
garage apartments, to apartments over downtown shops or the neighborhood corner store. We see
neighborhoods with several different well-designed housing types for all incomes where the elderly, young
families, singles and others share experiences and help one another.
? Economic Opportunity: We see a community of workers with good paying jobs, and a diverse local
economy with employment in services, retail, manufacturing and agriculture, among others. We see workers
with pride in their work and the prospect of continual advancement as they go on to develop their skills and
earning power.
? Fiscal Responsibility and Better Services: We see a more compact "town" development pattern
resulting in considerable cost savings to the taxpayer when compared to a sprawling development pattern.
These savings have been realized through fewer miles in paved streets, shorter water and sewer lines, and more
economical trash collection over shorter routes, more efficient fire protection, and more effective communitybased
policing, etc.
To this end, this Ordinance embodies the principle of Sustainable Growth. Very simply,
this means that the City seeks to accommodate and maintain population growth and
economic expansion using coordinated planning and design. This principle fosters the
philosophy that each development decision represents an investment in the long-term viability
of the City. Thus, the commitment on the part of the City to improve, extend, and maintain
public infrastructure must be coupled with a similar commitment to quality investment in all
building and development.

CHAPTER 2: DISTRICTS
2.1 Purpose
To carry out the provisions of this Land
Development Ordinance within the
jurisdiction of the City of Salisbury, the
following districts are hereby established.
These districts are ordered and classified
according to a Rural-Urban Transect. The
Transect is a method of classifying the
natural and built environments as a continuum of six conditions, ranging from rural to
urban. The value of the Transect is that it serves to locate any given place within a context in
which all of the parts fit together harmoniously.
For example, a rural street typically has no curbs or sidewalks and its buildings look like
farmhouses or barns. An urban street, depending on the intensity of urbanism, may have
curbs and gutters, regularly placed street trees, sidewalks, and building forms that include
common walls, flat roofs, and cornices. Each Transect zoning category has detailed
provisions for each neighborhood, for density, height, street design, the design of parks, the
mix of uses, building design, parking, and other aspects of the human environment.
The Transect begins with two zones that are entirely rural in character: Natural Zone (or T-
1), which is made up of lands protected in perpetuity; and Rural Zone (T-2), which includes
areas of high environmental or scenic quality that are not currently preserved, but perhaps
should be.
The transition zone between countryside and town is called the Suburban Zone (T-3), which
encompasses the most rural part of the neighborhood, and the countryside just beyond. The
T-3 area is primarily single family homes. Although the T-3 area is the most purely
residential zone, it can have some mixed-use, such as civic buildings; schools are particularly
appropriate for the T-3 area. Next is the General Urban Zone (T-4), typically the largest
zone. Urban Residential is primarily residential, but more urban in character, having
somewhat higher density with a mix of housing types and a slightly greater mix of uses
allowed.
At the more urban end of the spectrum are two zones which are primarily mixed use: Urban
Center, or T-5. This can be a small neighborhood center or a larger town center, the latter
serving more than one neighborhood. The Urban Core or Downtown (T-6) serves the
region, not only adjacent neighborhoods, and is typically understood as the central business
district. Additionally, the Special Districts make allowance for auto-dependent activities, such
as big box retail, institutional campuses, and industrial zones.
The zoning districts for the City of Salisbury have thus been ordered along this Transect
providing an appropriate detailing of development at each end of the continuum (rather than
homogenous standardization) as well as a simplified tool for users of this Ordinance to use
to facilitate appropriate development. The graphic on this page shows the defining features
of various types of developments at either end of the Rural-Urban spectrum.

2.3 Base Districts
In accordance with North Carolina General Statute 160A-382 that sets forth the
establishment of zoning regulation by district, the City of Salisbury, as indicated on the Land
Development District Map, is hereby divided into various districts that set forth uniform
regulations for the development of land within each district.
The purpose of these district regulations is to provide a regulating plan for the use of land
and buildings in conditions of good health and safety and in conditions of orderly
community development. These regulations shall apply to all land and structures within the
respective zoning district.
Open Space Preserve (OSP)

A. Natural Preserve
1. OSP: Open Space Preserve *
The Open Space Preserve District is intended to protect areas that are
permanently preserved in government ownership or conservation easements as
natural and/or environmentally significant lands. Such areas include rural parks,
wetlands, and areas placed in a conservation easement.
* Specific Base District Provisions apply to this district.
B. Residential
The residential districts are intended to create, maintain, and promote a variety of
housing opportunities for individual households and to maintain the desired
physical character of existing neighborhoods. While the districts primarily
accommodate detached residential uses, townhomes and apartments at a lower
density range that are compatible with the surrounding neighborhoods are also
allowed with additional standards.

1. RR: Rural Residential *
The Rural Residential District is intended to accommodate low-density, rural
residential and agricultural uses, protect natural vistas, and landscape features
that define our rural heritage.
* Specific Base District Provisions apply to this district.
2. GR: General Residential
The General Residential District is intended for Citys existing predominatelyresidential
neighborhoods as well as provide for new primarily-residential
development in accordance with a suburban pattern. These Districts are
differentiated only by the density of the overall development relative to the
planning goals of the City as set forth in the Comprehensive Plan.
3. HR: Historic Residential *
The Historic Residential District is intended to solidify development patterns
and land uses inherent to existing historic neighborhoods currently listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or within a local historic district designated
by the City of Salisbury.
* Specific Base District Provisions apply to this district.
4. UR: Urban Residential
The Urban Residential Districts accommodate the in-town neighborhoods of
the City and provides for a variety of compatible housing types and a limited
mix of uses in a walkable context. These Districts are differentiated only by the
density of the overall development relative to the planning goals of the City as
set forth in the Land-Use Plan.
C. Mixed-Use
The residential and commercial mixed-use districts are intended to accommodate a
variety of housing opportunities, office, retail, and service uses, and to ensure that
these areas are compatible with the character of existing neighborhoods at
intensities compatible with the applicable Transect Zone and scale of development.
These districts primarily accommodate townhomes, apartments, upper-story
residential, and commercial uses in order to promote live-work and mixed-use
opportunities.
1. RMX: Residential Mixed-Use
The Residential Mixed-Use District is intended to accommodate moderately
higher density residential and transitional non-residential development in close
proximity (within ½ - ¼ mile) to existing and planned commercial nodes and
along the boundaries of existing neighborhoods with immediate access to a
thoroughfare. The intent is to permit density increases in areas that do not harm
existing lower-density neighborhoods while complimenting commercial districts
with physical proximity and pedestrian connectivity. Different housing types
and lot styles along with a limited mix of neighborhood-friendly uses are
encouraged.

2. NMX: Neighborhood Mixed-Use
The Neighborhood Mixed-Use District is coded to provide pedestrian-scaled,
higher density residential and opportunities for limited scale commercial
activities along existing mixed-use corridors, in areas of transition, and at the
functional center of new neighborhoods. Development in this district should
encourage pedestrian activity through construction of mixed-use buildings and
connections to adjacent neighborhoods. Buildings in this district are typically
small and detached.
3. CMX: Corridor Mixed-Use
The Corridor Mixed-Use District is coded to facilitate convenient access,
minimize traffic congestion, and reduce the visual impact of auto-oriented uses
along the Citys older major thoroughfares. Developments in this district should
be traditionally detailed and encourage pedestrian use through connections to
adjacent neighborhoods and the construction of vertically mixed-use buildings.
4. DMX: Downtown Mixed-Use
The Downtown Mixed-Use District is coded for the traditional downtown area.
Individual buildings are encouraged to be multi-story with uses mixed vertically,
street level commercial and upper level office and residential. Higher densities
of residential development are encouraged. It is the purpose of these regulations
to encourage vitality by excluding certain activities which have a negative effect
on the public realm through auto-dominated or non-pedestrian oriented design
or uses. Maximum density is unlimited (inclusive of 50 units/acre)
D. Assigned Districts
The assigned districts are specialized districts that are intended to accommodate
specialized uses and districts that do not fit into the prescribed Transect categories,
such as airports, college campuses, industrial parks, and regional hospitals. In the
City of Salisbury case, this also includes the accommodation of a broad range of
high-intensity, automotive-oriented retail and service uses that require high visibility
and highly- accessible locations along arterial thoroughfares or boulevards and do
not cater directly to pedestrians while requiring sufficient off-street parking.
1. HB: Highway Business
The intensity of commercial development in the Highway Business District is
established by the traffic of the fronting thoroughfare. The intent of these
regulations is to facilitate convenient access, minimize traffic congestion, and
reduce the visual impact of excessive signage and parking lots.
2. HS: Hospital Services
The Hospital Mixed-Use District serves as a primary employment center
generally concentrated within ¼ mile of a local hospital complex. It permits the
continuation and expansion of the hospital complex, as well as supporting uses
such as office, lodging, and limited retail uses in close proximity.

3. CI: Community & Institution
The Community & Institution District is coded to permit the development and
continuation of uses that either serve or are of interest to a community or the
general public. The CI district may be located in either residential or nonresidential
areas; therefore, uses are generally limited to non-profit or
institutional.
4. LI: Light Industrial *
The Light Industrial District is coded to permit the development and operation
of light and/or flex space uses that are typically too large in scale to fit within a
neighborhood environment and should be buffered from surrounding
neighborhood uses. Light Industrial districts may not be used for retail uses
except for those uses clearly subordinate to any on-site principal use such as a
sales showroom for a warehouse. In the interest of economic development this
District is reserved for non-residential uses only to preserve adequate
opportunities for future relocation and expansion of employment-based uses.
* Specific Base District Provisions apply to this district.
5. HI: Heavy Industrial *
The Heavy Industrial District is coded to permit the development and operation
of heavy industrial uses, including manufacturing, processing, and assembling of
parts and products and distribution of products at the wholesale or retail level.
The standards established for heavy industrial areas are designed to promote
sound, permanent industrial development. Heavy Industrial districts may not be
used for retail uses except for those uses clearly subordinate to any on-site
principal use such as a sales showroom for a warehouse. In the interest of
economic development this District is reserved for non-residential uses only to
preserve adequate opportunities for future relocation and expansion of
employment-based uses.
* Specific Base District Provisions apply to this district.
6. TND: Traditional Neighborhood Development *
The intent of this District is to allow for the development of fully integrated,
mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods that minimize traffic congestion,
suburban sprawl, infrastructure costs, and environmental degradation.
Traditional Neighborhood Developments adhere to the following design
principles:
* Specific Base District Provisions apply to this district.
¦ All neighborhoods have identifiable centers and edges
¦ Edge lots are readily accessible to retail by non-vehicular means (a distance
not greater than ¼ - ½ mile)
¦ Uses and housing types are mixed and in close proximity to one another
¦ Street networks are interconnected and blocks are small
¦ Civic uses are given prominent sites throughout the neighborhood
¦ All lots are in walking distance of recreational open space

2.6 Overlay Districts
Pursuant to North Carolina General Statute 160A-382, the following overlay districts are
established. There are two types of overlay districts within this Ordinance: Fixed Overlay
Districts and Floating Overlay Districts.
Fixed Overlay Districts
A. G-EIO: Gateway  East Innes Street Overlay
Appendix A of this LDO. These specific overlay provisions were adopted under
Ordinance 2003-57 on September 2, 2003 and remain in full force and effect.
B. AZO: Airport Zoning Overlay
Appendix D of this LDO. These specific overlay provisions were adopted under
Ordinance 2005-06 on February 1, 2005 and remain in full force and effect.
C. LHO: Local Historic Overlay
1. Purpose and Intent: The historical heritage of Salisbury is one of our most
valued and important assets. The Local Historic Overlay (LHO) District is
created to encourage the restoration, preservation, rehabilitation, and
conservation of districts, buildings, sites, and objects with historical and/or
architectural significance and to prevent the decline, decay, and/or demolition
of such districts, buildings, sites, and objects.
2. Uses Permitted: All uses permitted in the underlying zoning district shall be
permitted in the LHO. Regulations of this Section shall not be interpreted to
further regulate the use of the structures in the underlying zoning districts.
3. Regulation of Exterior Features: No exterior feature of any building or other
structure, landscape or natural feature, above-ground utility structure or any
type of on-premise sign shall be erected, altered, restored, moved or demolished
within an LHO until an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness has
been submitted to and approved by the Historic Preservation Commission.
Exterior features include the architectural style, general design, color and
general arrangement of the exterior of the building or other structure, including
the kind and texture of the building materials, the size and scale of the building,
and the type and style of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs, and other
appurtenant fixtures. In the case of outdoor advertising signs, exterior features
refer to the style, material, size, color, and location of all such signs.
4. Features Not Considered: The Historic Preservation Commission shall not
consider interior arrangement nor take any action to restrict interior changes
except for the purpose of preventing the construction, reconstruction,
alteration, restoration, moving or demolition of buildings, structures,
appurtenant features, or outdoor advertising signs in the LHO which would be
incompatible with its historic aspects.

shall be based upon the United States Secretary of the Interior's Standards for
Rehabilitation as follows:
a) A property shall be used for its historical purpose or be placed in a new use
that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building
and its site and environment.
b) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The
removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that
characterize a property shall be avoided.
c) Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place,
and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as
adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings,
shall not be undertaken.
d) Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquires
historical significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
e) Distinctive features, finishes, and constructive techniques or examples of
craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
f) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where
the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature,
the new one shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual
qualities and where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features
shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
g) Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to
historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if
appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
h) Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected
and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures
shall be undertaken.
i) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not
destroy historical materials that characterize the property. The new work
shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of
the property and its environment.
j) New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken
in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and
integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.

D. WPO: Watershed Protection Overlay
1. Purpose and Intent: The purpose and intent of this Section is to regulate the
development and land-use density in certain watershed areas in order to limit
water supply watershed exposure to non-point source discharge and pollution.
The non-point source discharge can contribute biological contamination,
turbidity from soil erosion and sedimentation, nutrient enhancement, and heavy
metal pollution; all of which endanger the water supplies that provide drinking
water to the City.
As required by the Water Supply Watershed Protection Act of 1989 (G.S. § 143-
214.5), the State of North Carolina has classified each of North Carolinas
drinking water supply watersheds to an appropriate classification. The
designated watershed within the Salisbury planning and zoning jurisdiction is
classified as WS-IV and is a protected water supply that is moderately to
highly developed.
The existing built-upon surface area is not counted toward the allocated built
upon area. For the purposes of calculating built-upon area, total project area
shall include total acreage in the tract on which the project is to be developed.
2. Watershed IV Protected Area:
Only new development activities that require an erosion/sedimentation control
plan under North Carolina law are required to meet the provisions of this
Ordinance when located in a WS-IV-PA watershed.
A natural vegetative buffer of 50-100 feet shall be provided on all lands
contiguous to each side of all perennial streams and watercourses in this
Watershed.
a) Allowed Uses
i. Agriculture subject to the provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985,
the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, and 15A
NCAC 2H.0217 are permitted. (Note: The Soil and Water
Conservation Commission is the designated management agency
responsible for implementing the provisions of this Chapter relating to
agricultural activities.)
ii. Silviculture, subject to the provisions of the Forest Practices Guidelines
related to water quality (15 NCAC 1l.6101-.0209).
iii. Residential development.
iv. Non-residential development.

b) Density and Maximum Built-Upon Limits
i. Single Family Residential Uses (Low Impervious Cover Option):
Development shall not exceed two (2) dwelling units per acre on a
project by project basis. Cluster developments are also allowed in
accordance with sub-section D below. Required natural vegetative
buffer: 50 feet.
ii. All Other Permitted Residential and Non-Residential (Low
Impervious Cover Option): Development under the low density
option shall not exceed twenty-four percent (24%) built-upon area on a
project-by-project basis. Required natural vegetative buffer: 50 feet.
iii. High Density Cover Option: Where new development is proposed to
exceed either two (2) dwelling units per acre or 24% built-upon area,
engineered stormwater controls (BMPs) shall be used to control runoff
from the first inch of rainfall. In no instance may development exceed
seventy (70%) built-upon area on a project by project basis. All BMPs
shall meet the standards of Section C below. Required natural
vegetative buffer: 100 feet.
3. Best Management Practices (BMPs)
One or more of the following best management practices (BMPs) are required
to achieve an efficiency of 85% Total Suspended Solids (TSS) Removal:

4. Cluster Development
Cluster development is allowed in the Watershed Area under the following
conditions:
a) Minimum lot sizes are not applicable to single family cluster development
projects; however, the total number of lots shall not exceed the number of
lots allowed for single family detached developments in the underlying
zoning districts. Density or built-upon area for the project shall not exceed
that allowed for the critical area or protected area, whichever applies.

b) All built-upon area shall be designed and located to minimize stormwater
runoff impact to the receiving waters and minimize concentrated
stormwater flow.
c) The remainder of the tract shall remain in a vegetated or natural state. The
title to the open space area shall be conveyed to an incorporated
homeowners association for management; to a local government for
preservation as a park or open space; to a conservation organization for
preservation in a permanent easement; or it may be privately held, as long
as a permanent conservation easement is placed on the land. Where a
property association is not incorporated, a maintenance agreement shall be
filed with the property deeds.
Floating Overlay Districts
A. CD: Conditional District
1. Purpose and Intent: The Conditional District (CD) is a floating overlay zoning
district that exempts specific Ordinance provisions so as to encourage
innovative design. Although not measured against all provisions of this
Ordinance, the City will review CD development in light of all applicable,
adopted plans and policies in order to provide greater certainty as to the
resulting project.
For the developer, the Conditional District has the highest level of flexibility for
the design of the development. The CD is not subject to all of the traditional
Ordinance standards. Instead, design elements are determined for the specific
development and are written into the rezoning Ordinance, which becomes law.
For City Council and the community, since the urban design elements are
expressly stated in the rezoning Ordinance and become law, there is a greater
degree of certainty as to the final product. The City Council can negotiate with
the developer to add conditions, requirements or limitations.
2. Minimum Area: There shall be no minimum land area required for a
Conditional District except when developed as an MHD-CD, where the
minimum land area shall be 3 acres.
3. District Provisions: The Conditional District is an alternative zoning process
that may permit a mixture of land uses and alternative development standards as
may be required to address the unique characteristics of an individual property
through a Master Plan. The plan shall be designed such that, at a minimum, the
location, integration and arrangement of land uses, buildings, structures, utilities,
access, transit, parking, and streets collectively yield a context sensitive
development. The CD is not intended to relieve hardships that would otherwise
be handled using a variance procedure; rather, the CD is intended as a means of
accommodating design innovation and market expectations.

and may remain in existence where adopted by City Council; however, no new
or expansion of the boundaries of existing GD-A districts shall be authorized
under this Ordinance. Within a general development-A district (GD-A) any
commercial or industrial use permitted in the base zoning district shall be
permitted only when developed and maintained in accordance with a City
Council-approved site plan. City Council review and consideration shall be

2.7 Uses Permitted By District
A. All uses permitted in this Ordinance have been divided into nine (9) general
categories as detailed in Chapter 18 and are generally defined as follows:
1. Residential: Premises available for long-term human habitation by means of
ownership and rental, but excluding short-term leasing or rental of less than a
months duration.
2. Lodging: Premises available for short-term human habitation, including daily
and weekly rental.
3. Office/Service: Premises available for the transaction of general business and
the provision of services, but excluding retail sales and manufacturing, except as
a minority component.
4. Retail/Restaurants: Premises available for the commercial sale of
merchandise, prepared foods, and food and drink consumption, but excluding
manufacturing.
5. Entertainment/Recreation: Premises for the gathering of people for
purposes such as arts and culture, amusement, and recreation.
6. Manufacturing/Wholesale/Storage: Premises available for the creation,
assemblage, storage, and repair of items including their wholesale or retail sale.
7. Civic/Institutional: Premises available for organizations dedicated to religion,
education, government, social service, health care, and other similar functions.
8. Infrastructure: Uses and structures dedicated to transportation,
communication, information, and utilities.
B. Interpretation of Use Matrix
1. Uses not listed as a permitted (P), permitted with additional standards (PS) or
requiring a special use permit (SUP) are presumed to be prohibited from the
applicable zoning district. In the event that a particular use is not listed in the
Use Matrix, and such use is not listed as a prohibited use and is not otherwise
prohibited by law, the Administrator shall determine whether a materially
similar use exists in this Chapter. Should the Administrator determine that a
materially similar use does exist, the regulations governing that use shall apply to
the particular use not listed and the Administrators decision shall be recorded
in writing. Should the Administrator determine that a materially similar use does
not exist, this Chapter may be amended to establish a specific listing for the use
in question.

2. The Administrator may determine that a use is materially similar if:
a) The use is listed as within the same Structure or Function classification as
the use specifically enumerated in the Use Matrix, as determined by the
Land-Based Classification Standards (LBCS) of the American Planning
Association [Reference: http://www.planning.org/lbcs/index.html]. The use shall
be considered materially similar if it falls within the same LBCS
classification and meets the requirements of subsection b below.
b) The proposed use shall not generate average daily trips exceeding other
similar uses proposed in the zoning district by more than ten percent (10%),
as determined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip
Generation (7th ed., 2003)(the ITE Manual), which document is hereby
incorporated by this reference. If the trip generation is not listed in the ITE
Manual, then the use shall be considered materially similar to the use that
most closely approximates the proposed use. The Administrator may also
refer to similar local traffic studies.
3. In order to assist in interpretation of the Use Matrix, the LBCS numbers where
applicable are enumerated in Chapter 18, Definitions. In interpreting the Use
Matrix, the following rules of construction shall apply:
a) If a use is listed for a specific classification, while a more general
classification within the same industry classification is also listed for another
use, the specific classification governs. The specific use is not permitted in
all districts where the uses coded to the general classification are permitted
simply because they share a similar LBCS code number. The numbers
increase as the classifications get more specific.
b) Some uses are listed separately, but fall within the same LBCS classification.
The uses within one such classification are not permitted in all of the
zoning districts as the others simply because they fall within the same LBCS
classification.

Chapter 3. ADDITIONAL USE STANDARDS
3.1 Purpose and Intent
There are certain uses that exist which may be
constructed, continued, and/or expanded
provided they meet certain mitigating
conditions specific to their design and/or
operation. Such conditions ensure compatibility among building types so that different uses
may by located in proximity to one another without adverse effects to either. This Chapter
specifies those requirements that shall be met by all the uses listed in the Uses Permitted
with Additional Standards and Special Uses sections for each District in Chapter 2.
Each use shall be permitted upon compliance with all conditions listed for the use in this
chapter. Certain uses are classified as Special Uses and require a Special Use Permit and
City Council approval in accordance with Section 15.17.
3.2 Applicability
The regulations contained in this Chapter shall be applicable in those districts within which
such uses are permitted.
3.3 Additional Standards by Use
A. Adult Establishments  For HB only
The purpose of this special exception shall be to permit the location of adult
establishments within a commercial or industrial district of the city provided the
proposed business adheres to the guidelines established herein.
Because of their very nature, adult establishments are recognized as having serious
objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when they are located near a
residential zoning district or certain existing land uses. Special regulation of these
establishments is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to a
downgrading or blighting of surrounding residential districts or neighborhoods, unless
otherwise determined by this Section.
1. Location Standards: No portion of a lot for an adult establishment may be
located within a 1000-foot radius (determined by a straight line and not street
distance) of any place of worship, school (public or private), specialty school,
day care facility, public park, college or university, nursing home, hospital or any
residential zoning district. No portion of the lot on which the adult
establishment is located shall be situated within 1000 feet of another adult
establishment.

DD. Wireless Telecommunication Facility  For All Districts
The purpose and intent of this section is to provide regulations regarding and affecting
the location and characteristics of commercial (i.e., non-governmental or emergency
use) wireless telecommunications facilities in the City of Salisburys zoning jurisdiction.
In recognition of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is the intent of the City of
Salisbury to allow Wireless Telecommunication providers the opportunity to locate
towers and related facilities within its jurisdiction in order to provide an adequate level
of service to its customers while protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens
of Salisbury. Wireless Telecommunication Facilities may be considered undesirable with
other types of uses, most notably residential, therefore, special regulations are necessary
to ensure that any adverse effects to existing and future development are mitigated.
1. Location of Wireless Telecommunication Facilities
a. Applicants for wireless telecommunications facilities shall demonstrate to
the city its efforts to locate, site and erect said wireless
telecommunications facilities in accordance with the following
preferences, one (1) being the highest preference and four (4) being the
lowest preference.
(1) On existing telecommunications towers or other tall structures;
(2) Co-location on a site with existing wireless telecommunications
facilities or structures;
(3) On municipally owned properties;
(4) On other property in the city.
b. If the proposed site is not the highest preference listed above, then a
detailed written explanation must be provided as to why a site of a higher
preference was not selected. The applicant must satisfactorily demonstrate
the reason or reasons why such a permit should be granted for the
proposed site and the hardship that would be incurred by the applicant if
the permit were not granted for the proposed site.
c. An applicant may not by-pass sites of higher preference solely because the
site presented is the only site leased or selected. An application shall
address collocation as an option and if such option is not proposed, the
applicant must explain why collocation is commercially or otherwise
impracticable. Agreements between providers limiting or prohibiting
collocation, shall not be a valid basis for any claim of commercial
impracticability or hardship.
d. Notwithstanding the above, the council may approve any site located
within an area in the above list of preferences, provided that the council
finds that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety, and
welfare of the city and its inhabitants.

ORD.2017-17; 4/3/18, ORD.2018-15; 4/6/2019, ORD.2019-19
e. The applicant shall submit a written report demonstrating the applicant's
review of alternative sites considered in light of the preferences,
demonstrating the technological reason for the site selection. If the site
selected is not the highest preference, then a detailed written explanation
as to why sites of a higher preference were not selected shall be included
with the application.
f. The applicant shall, in writing, identify and disclose the number and
locations of any additional sites that the applicant has been, is, or will be
considering, reviewing or planning for wireless telecommunications
facilities in the city, and all municipalities adjoining the city, for a two-year
period following the date of the application.
g. Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of highest
preference or highest available preference, the council may disapprove an
application for any of the following reasons:
(1) Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements;
(2) Conflict with traffic needs or traffic ordinances, or definitive plans
for changes in traffic flow or traffic ordinances;
(3) Conflict with the historic nature of a neighborhood or historical
district;
(4) The use or construction of wireless telecommunications facilities
which is contrary to an already stated purpose of a specific zoning
or land use designation;
(5) The placement and location of wireless telecommunications
facilities which would create an unacceptable risk, or the probability
of such, to residents, the public, employees and agents of the city,
or employees of the service provider or other service providers;
(6) Conflicts with the provisions of this article.
2. Lot Size and Setbacks for Wireless Telecommunication Facilities
a. All proposed wireless telecommunications facilities shall be set back from
abutting parcels, recorded rights-of-way and road and street lines a
distance sufficient to substantially contain on-site icefall or debris from a
tower or tower failure, and to preserve the privacy and sanctity of any
adjoining properties. The minimum setback for a tower shall be the height
of the tower plus ten (10) feet.
b. All proposed wireless telecommunications facilities shall be located with a
minimum setback from any property line a distance equal to the height of
the wireless telecommunications facility or the existing setback
requirement of the underlying zoning district, whichever is greater.
Further, any accessory structure shall be located so as to comply with the

situated.
c. The setback and fall zone requirements of this article shall apply to
extensions of existing facilities to accommodate the co-location of
additional equipment on the existing site. If the tower on which an
extension is proposed is designed to collapse upon itself in the event of
catastrophic failure, then any extension of the tower shall likewise be
designed to collapse upon itself. If the existing tower is not designed to
collapse upon itself, then any extension of the tower shall comply with the
setback requirements set forth in subsection (a) hereof unless the council
waives such requirement.

service facilities do not extend beyond the top of the building or structure
on which they are being mounted.
b. Such facilities shall be designed to blend in with the existing structure or
buildings with similar colors or other techniques as appropriate.
4. Co-Location
a. Shared use of existing wireless telecommunications facilities shall be
preferred by the city, as opposed to the proposed construction of a new
telecommunications tower. Where such shared use is unavailable, location
of antennas on other pre-existing structures shall be considered and
preferred. The applicant shall submit a comprehensive report inventorying
existing towers and other structures identified by the city at the preapplication
meeting or, if no such meeting is conducted, within ten (10)
business days of receipt of the application, within a two-mile radius of any
proposed new tower site, unless the applicant can show that some other
distance is more reasonable, and outlining opportunities for shared use of
existing facilities and the use of other pre-existing structures as a preferred
alternative to new construction.
b. An applicant intending to share use of an existing telecommunications
tower or other structure shall be required to document the intent of the
existing owner to share use.
c. Such shared use shall consist only of the minimum antenna array
technologically required to provide service within the city, to the extent
practicable, unless good cause is shown.

Chapter 4. SUBDIVISIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE
4.1 Purpose and Intent
The purpose of this chapter is to establish
procedures and standards for the proper
subdivision of land within the jurisdiction of the
City of Salisbury in order to provide for orderly
growth and development; for the coordination
of streets and highways within proposed
subdivisions with existing or planned streets
and highways and with other public facilities; to
provide for the dedication of rights-of-way or
easements for street and utility purposes; and to
provide for the distribution of traffic in a
manner that will avoid congestion and will
create conditions essential to the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
In addition, this chapter is guided by and
intends to fulfill the following policy directives of the Salisbury Vision 2020 Comprehensive Plan:
? New neighborhood streets and minor streets shall be no wider than necessary to serve their intended
purpose. Street widths shall be designed to fit the intended use of the street, corresponding to the traffic
load and the planned development types.
? Street designs in new neighborhoods shall give equal priority to the pedestrian and the automobile. In
newly developing areas, sidewalks shall be required as an integral part of the communitys basic
infrastructure. Except where constrained by unusual physical limitations, a minimum sidewalk width of
five feet shall be required. Except where constrained by physical limitations or other obvious reasons,
sidewalks shall be required on both sides of the street.
? Bikeways shall be planned for as a system-wide component of Salisburys transportation planning. New
neighborhoods shall recognize bike routes at the time of development. All future subdivision plats and
site plans shall be examined for bicycle compatibility and conformity with the city-wide bikeway plan.
? The City shall encourage street patterns that respond to site topography, accentuate focal points and
interesting vistas, create interesting public spaces and intersections, and that are coordinated with the
placement of significant structures or open spaces.
? On-street parking shall be encouraged in compact neighborhoods.
? The turning radius of corners at intersections involving minor streets shall be as small as possible while
allowing for reasonable truck and emergency vehicle maneuvering.
? New neighborhoods shall be connected to other residential, shopping, and work areas within the
neighborhood planning area. A fully connected honeycomb of streets shall provide convenient circulation
within the neighborhood and provide for multiple, alternative outlets from the area to adjoining
neighborhoods and major streets. Care shall be taken that the creation of cut-through traffic routes is
avoided.
? Access to major streets shall be from intersecting minor streets rather than private driveways, whenever
possible. Minor streets should be located so as to intersect with major streets at regularly spaced,
reasonably frequent intervals.

4.2 General Subdivision Platting Provisions
These provisions shall apply to the subdivision of property by means of an Exception Plat,
Minor Subdivision, or Major Subdivision.
A. All Lots to Front on Street or Public Space: All lots shall front upon a public street,
or with the provision of alley access, lots may front upon recreational open space as
defined by this Ordinance.
B. Side Lot Lines: Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street
lines.
C. Flag Lots: Flag (or pipestem) lots are prohibited in all zoning districts except the
OSP and the RR districts, where they shall be allowed if the width of the stem is at least
sixty (60) feet.
D. Double Frontage Lots: Double frontage lots should be avoided. However, on lots
having frontage on two streets and not located on a corner, the minimum front yard
shall be provided on each street in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
On lots having frontage on more than two streets, the minimum front yard shall be
provided in accordance with the regulations set forth in this Ordinance on at least two
of the street frontages. The minimum front yard on the remaining frontage may be
reduced in accordance with the street side yard requirements of the district. When a
double frontage lot has frontage along a Thoroughfare, access to the lot shall be via the
non-thoroughfare frontage.
E. Residential Buffer Strips: In residential developments in residential districts (RR, GR,
UR, HR) a buffer strip of at least fifty (50) feet in depth in addition to the normal lot
depth shall be provided adjacent to all railroads and limited access highways. This strip
shall be a part of the platted lots, but shall have the following restriction lettered on the
face of the plat: "This strip reserved for the planting of trees or shrubs by the owners;
the building of structures hereon is prohibited."
F. Easements: Utility and other easements shall be provided as follows:
1. Utility Easements: Utility easements centered on rear or side lot lines shall be
provided where necessary and shall be at least (10) feet in width.
2. Watercourses: Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement conforming
substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and such further width of
construction, or both, shall be in accordance with the adopted Uniform
Construction Standards of the City of Salisbury.
G. Street Names: Proposed streets names are subject to the approval of Rowan County.
Proposed streets which are clearly in alignment with other existing streets shall bear the
assigned name of the existing street.

4.9 Sidewalk Program
A. Sidewalk Requirements
1. Existing Streets: As part of a proposed subdivision or new development along an
existing publicly-maintained street in the corporate city limits, sidewalks shall be
constructed along all applicable street frontages per the standards of Section 4.7 of
this chapter.
2. Infill Lots: Sidewalk construction may not be required if the new development lot is
considered an infill lot pursuant to Section 6.3.I, Infill Provisions, Sidewalk
Compatibility Standards.
3. New Streets: As part of new street construction, sidewalks shall be constructed along
both sides of the new street per the standards of Section 4.7 of this chapter.
B. Sidewalk Alternatives for Existing Streets
When the approving authority determines that the construction of a required sidewalk along
an existing publicly-maintained street in the corporate city limits is unfeasible due to special
circumstances, including but not limited to: impending road widening, significant street trees,
severe roadside conditions, substandard street sections, or unreasonable cost considerations;
the approving authority may require either: 1) a payment in lieu of sidewalk construction, 2)
construction of an equal linear foot of sidewalk elsewhere within the applicable Planning
District, or 3) a combination of the previous. In determining alternate sidewalk locations
within the applicable Planning District, the approving authority shall consider elevated
Sidewalk Priority Index scores.
C. Sidewalk Payment In Lieu Program
As authorized under this section, a payment may be made to the City of Salisbury in lieu of
sidewalk construction. The value of the payment shall equal the average linear foot sidewalk
project cost, as determined on an annual basis by the Engineering & Development Services
department of the City of Salisbury. The applicant is informed of the amount to be paid upon
issuance of the zoning permit, or adoption of the ordinance for a Conditional District Overlay
development, and payment shall be made prior to issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.
Payments received in lieu of construction shall be assigned to one of nine (9) Planning
Districts (as identified on the Sidewalk Priority Index Map (Appendix B of this LDO)) based
on the location of the development seeking use of the payment in lieu program. These
districts are areas in which payments shall be spent for the safety and convenience of
pedestrians utilizing the sidewalk or pedestrian network within that district. Each district best
follows census tract boundaries as well as representing, to the extent practical, an area where
pedestrian circulation can take place without traversing major barriers, such as interstate
freeways, major federal or state highways, railroad corridors, and significant streams or creeks
which are, by definition, unsafe or unsuitable for pedestrian crossing.
CHAPTER 4: SUBDIVISIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE

AMENDED 5/6/08, ORD.2008-17; 5/5/09, ORD.2009-30; 3/18/10, ORD.2010-11; 2/21/12,
ORD.2012-07; 6/17/14, ORD.2014-22; 10/2/18, ORD.2018-48
The amount to be paid is determined by using the Sidewalk Priority Index (SPI) and the
aggregate SPI street segment scores. The scores are prioritized Low, Medium, and High as
follows:
1. Low SPI Score = 0-5. Street segments within this scoring range may either construct
the required sidewalk or receive a 75% discount on the pay in lieu fee.
2. Medium SPI Score = 6-11. Street segments within this scoring range may either
construct the required sidewalk or receive a 50% discount on the pay in lieu fee.
3. High SPI Score = 12 or greater. Street segments within this scoring range may
either construct the required sidewalk or pay in lieu with no discount.
The Sidewalk Priority Index (SPI) is intended to ensure that sidewalks are first constructed or
repaired where existing need is the greatest and where the potential for pedestrian traffic is the
greatest. In general, pedestrian activity is directly attributable to factors, or pedestriangenerating
characteristics, such as proximity to major destinations, specific zoning districts,
and transit routes. By overlapping multiple characteristics, one can easily visualize the
concentration of resources in a particular area. The cumulative intensity of all characteristics at
a specific location determines the varying levels of prioritization. The SPI effectively adapts
this methodology by identifying the specific characteristics that most affect the potential for
walking in Salisbury. Those districts and pedestrian generating characteristics have been
assigned the following values, and scores are determined for street segments based on
aggregating overlapping characteristics:
1. All applicable zoning districts have been assigned a value according to the following
table:

2. The following are assigned a value of 3:
a. Colleges: Factors contributing to colleges generating heavy pedestrian
activity include a young population, businesses that cater to students, and
the fact that many students do not own automobiles. In addition, students,
faculty, and staff often live nearby. Therefore, all street segments within ¼-
mile of all college campuses are assigned a value of 3.
b. Greenways & Parks: Greenways and parks attract recreational users of all
ages. Greenways, specifically, are part of the pedestrian infrastructure itself
and are used for transportation purposes. Additionally, Salisbury is unique
in that all parks in the system, except for the Community Park, are
accessible by foot and are all adjacent to an existing neighborhood.
Therefore, all street segments within ¼-mile of existing Greenways and
parks are assigned a value of 3.
c. Transit: Almost all bus users begin and end their trips as pedestrians.
Accordingly, safe and continuous pedestrian facilities are an integral
component of a public transit system. Therefore, all street segments within
¼-mile of a transit route are assigned a value of 3.
3. The following are assigned a value of 2:
a. High Schools: Based on the fact that elementary, middle, and high schools
can generate many daily walking trips by students, whose ages typically
make them among the most vulnerable pedestrians, all street segments
within ¼-mile of high schools are assigned a value of 2.
b. Historic Overlay: Based on the traditional grid street network, traditional
medium-density platting, and the proximity of these district overlays to
neighborhood service and support, all street segments within the overlay
are assigned a value of 2.
4. The following are assigned a value of 1:
a. Civic Facilities: Because Salisburys civic buildings provide services to a
wide range of users, including children, senior adults, and disabled people,
all street segments within a ¼-mile of these facilities have been assigned a
value of 1.
b. Commercial Nodes: Based on the potential for higher density housing and
mixing of uses generally located in pods at significant intersections
throughout the city, all street segments within ¼-mile of the nodes are
assigned a value of 1.
c. East Innes Gateway Overlay: Based on the spirit and intent of this separate
overlay ordinance, the importance of the pedestrian and appropriatelyscaled
development assigns a value of 1 to the street segments within this
district.

d. Elementary & Middle Schools: Based on the fact that elementary, middle,
and high schools can generate many daily walking trips by students, whose
ages typically make them among the most vulnerable pedestrians, all street
segments within ¼-mile of elementary and middle schools are assigned a
value of 1.
e. Groceries & Health Clubs: Due to the current lack of regional commercial
development in Salisbury, the majority of all grocery stores are still within
the heaviest commercial nodes and adjacent to existing neighborhoods.
Our large-scale grocery stores still have the advantage of serving the public
in a manner similar to small-scale convenience. Regarding health clubs,
Salisbury recognizes the importance of healthful living and becoming a
more active community. Accordingly, all street segments within ¼-mile of
groceries and health clubs have been assigned a value of 1.
f. Medical Facilities: Hospitals and smaller medical facilities in Salisbury are
large employment centers, and two of which are located adjacent to wellestablished
neighborhoods and transit facilities. This characteristic
generates a considerable amount of pedestrian activity and transit use.
Accordingly, all street segments within ¼-mile of these facilities have been
assigned a value of 1.
g. Presence of Sidewalk: The presence of existing sidewalk within a scoring
roadway segment has been assigned a value of 1. This factor recognizes that
completing a sidewalk network and providing continuity of facilities
generally has greater value to pedestrians.
h. Thoroughfares: Thoroughfares are the most significant through-streets in a
roadway system and provide direct access to many destinations. In addition,
the speed and volume of motor vehicle traffic intensifies pedestrians need
for separate facilities. Accordingly, Major and Minor Thoroughfares have
been assigned a value of 1.
Scoring is determined along roadway segments  regardless of development or parcel size.
This prevents individual major pedestrian-generating projects from coincidentally falling
outside of many of the scoring characteristics and avoiding installation. In addition, it ensures
continuity of the sidewalk network between significant intersections, railroad crossings, or
other important features. The segment boundaries employed to determine the SPI score that
are first encountered, in any combination, shall be as follows:
1. Signalized intersections
2. Four-way stop intersection
3. Two-way stop intersections
4. Railroad crossings
5. Or a distance of approximately ½-mile to the nearest intersection, crossing, or
environmental feature if none of the above occur earlier

4.10 Connectivity & Street Stubs
Improving connectivity and limiting cul-de-sacs
result in improved mobility for motorists,
pedestrians, and cyclists; decreased response
time for emergency services and delivery costs
for services such as garbage collection through
improved routing options; and, dispersion of
motor vehicle traffic.
A Connectivity Index shall be used to determine
the adequacy of street connectivity in new
developments. The index is calculated as the
ratio of the number of street links in a projects
street layout (road sections between
intersections or stubs to adjacent property) plus
connections to existing streets divided by the
number of street nodes (intersections and culde-
sac heads).
Connectivity Index =
(? + C) / ?
The illustration above illustrates a connectivity
index of 1.44 (links are shown as circles, nodes
are shown as stars, and connections to existing
streets are shown as Cs). The illustration has 11
links, 2 connections, and 9 nodes for an index of
(11+2) / 9 = 1.44. In the illustration below, one
cul-de-sac is converted to a full intersection.
This gives the development one additional link
for a connectivity index of 1.55 ([12 links + 2
connections] / 9 nodes). The same number of
lots is shown in both illustrations.
A. Connectivity Index Requirement
Any development shall be required to
achieve a connectivity index as shown in

B. Street Stubs
1. Regardless of the following provisions of this subsection, street stubs are not
required to connect properties located within the LI or HI districts to properties
located within the OSP, RR, GR, UR, or HR districts.
2. Notwithstanding the above provision (4.10.B.1), all new development shall

3. The number of required
street stubs is
determined by
calculating the
cumulative linear feet of

4. The location of new required stub street shall be prioritized as follows:
a. Adjacent parcels 20 acres or greater
b. Adjacent parcels that abut thoroughfares or collector streets
c. Where any adopted transportation or land use plan recommends a street
connection
5. Where one or more of the following conditions would prevent practical
connectivity, the adjacent property shall not be included in the calculation of
required stubs:
a. Topographical conditions, where pre-development slopes are 15% or
greater
b. Environmental conditions, such as a wetland, blue-line stream, or
landfill

6. Stub streets and streets intended for extension during future phases shall be
constructed to extend to the property line or as close to the line as practical. It
shall be the responsibility of the second development to construct the
connection to an existing stub street. Stub streets shall not exceed 150 feet in
length without a paved turnaround.
4.11 Traffic Calming
A. Vertical traffic calming treatments are prohibited.
B. Horizontal traffic calming treatments, such as median islands, curb extensions, traffic
circles, and roundabouts are encouraged and shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with the City of Salisbury Uniform Construction Standards Manual.
4.12 Bicycle Accommodations  (RESERVED)
4.13 Access Management
Access management standards seek to preserve the traffic moving capability of the Citys
major streets, and in so doing, protect the investment of the taxpayer in the costs of road
construction. Frequent driveways allow for unpredictable stops and vehicle turning
movements, causing increased congestion, and greater opportunities for traffic accidents. The
City does not wish to allow unnecessary driveway cuts to neutralize the value of road
construction dollars provided by Federal, State and local taxpayers.
Access management standards that regulate the connection of driveways to the existing street
system shall be as follows. Where the NCDOT Driveway Manual or Median Crossover Guide
conflicts, the stricter of the two standards should prevail.
A. Driveway Number and Spacing (major thoroughfares only)
B. Driveway Distance from Intersections
C. Median Opening Spacing
The minimum spacing between median openings on major thoroughfares shall be 1000
feet or as required by NCDOT.

4.14 Transportation Impact Analysis
The Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) is a specialized study that evaluates the effects of a
developments traffic on the surrounding transportation infrastructure. It is an essential part
of the development review process to assist developers and government agencies in making
land use decisions involving annexations, subdivisions, rezonings, special land uses, and other
development reviews. The TIA helps identify where the development may have a significant
impact on safety, traffic and transportation operations, and provides a means for the
developer and government agencies to mitigate these impacts. Ultimately, the TIA can be
used to evaluate whether the scale of development is appropriate for a particular site and
what improvements may be necessary, on and off the site, to provide safe and efficient access
and traffic flow.
A. A TIA shall be required for a rezoning, subdivision plan, site plan, conditional use
permit, certificate of zoning compliance, or preliminary plat for developments with an
estimated trip generation of 3000 vehicles per day or greater during an average weekday
based on a five day national average as defined in the ITE Trip Generation Manual.
B. A traffic impact analysis report shall address the impact of projected horizon year (2
years after build-out by phase or entire development as appropriate) traffic volumes. It
shall identify the methodology used to evaluate the impact. The weekday peak hour
impact shall be evaluated as well as the Saturday peak hour
for those uses exhibiting high levels of weekend traffic
generation.
C. Based on the findings of the analysis, if a proposed
development does not meet the applicable service level
standards, the applicant shall be required to upgrade the
facilities in accordance with the adopted level of service
program. Mitigation measures may involve strategies other
than roadway construction or other physical
improvements such as changes to traffic signal timing or
phasing, and transportation management strategies.
D. Thresholds for Mitigation: The City requires
consideration of roadway and/or operational
improvements when the proposed development increases
the intersection Volume-to-Capacity Ratio (V/C) beyond
the thresholds indicated in the table below. The City
evaluates the impacts of proposed development at
intersections (primarily under existing year conditions)
based on the increase in V/C ratio as a result of the
projected site traffic. This increase is determined by
comparing the V/C ratio under existing development
conditions and proposed development conditions. For the
purposes of this comparison, all un-signalized intersections
are analyzed as signalized intersections.
Trip Generation:
The sum of the number of
inbound and outbound
vehicle trips that are
expected for the type and
size of the proposed land
use. For purposes of
determining the requirement
to submit a TIA,
adjustments such as modal
split, pass-by trips, and
internal capture rates will
be allowed to reduce the site
traffic calculation.
Note: Typically the
following developments meet
or exceed the 3000 vehicles
per day threshold:
? 55,000 sf Retail
? 300 Single family homes
? 250,000 sf Office
? 400,000 sf Industrial
? 350 room Hotel

Chapter 5. BUILDING TYPES AND STANDARDS
5.1 Purpose and Intent
The standards in this Chapter are
intended to attach the same or greater
level of importance to building design as
is placed on the use contained within.
The established architectural vernacular
of the City of Salisbury exhibits a widevariety
of common building types and
this Ordinance has established
regulations specific to these typologies.
The rich architectural history and
vocabulary of the City presents a wide
variety of development options for using
traditional forms while avoiding any
perception of monotony. Buildings are
expected to be added to the City of
Salisbury as long-term additions to the
architectural vibrancy of the community.
In addition, this chapter is guided by and intends to fulfill the following policy directives of
the Salisbury Vision 2020 Comprehensive Plan:
? Appropriately located, designed and scaled stores and services providing basic necessities to residents
of the Citys older neighborhoods shall be encouraged. Neighborhood serving businesses shall be
designed at a residential scale and character.
? New development in or adjoining an older commercial area should be compatible with existing
desirable development within its vicinity. Compatibility criteria shall include size, scale, massing,
fenestration, rhythm, setback, materials, context, and landscaping.
? Noteworthy buildings, important outdoor spaces, objects of historic merit, important monuments,
and significant works of art shall be placed in positions of visibility and prominence.
5.2 Applicability
The following provisions apply throughout the jurisdiction of this Ordinance. While the
General Provisions (Sec. 5.6) apply to all principle buildings, each building type shall also
comply with its own general, dimensional, and design element provisions according to
building type and zoning district.
5.3 Exceptions
A. Innovative planning or design ideas for development in any district where the
proposed building types and dimensional standards are different than those allowed
by the base district requirements may be approved subject to the approval of a
Conditional District.
B. Buildings in LI and HI districts are exempt from the provisions of this chapter,
except for any applicable dimensional standards.

C. Minor additions or modifications to any principle building existing upon the
effective date of this Ordinance are exempt from the provisions of this chapter,
except for the applicable dimensional bulk standards and those requirements in
Section 5.6.D, Encroachments. Minor addition shall mean any addition to the
principle building that is less than 25% of the gross floor area. Minor modification
shall mean any work requiring a Zoning Permit that is valued less than 25% of the
Rowan County assessed valuation.
D. Except where specific provisions and dimensional standards in this chapter apply,

provisions of this Ordinance.
E. Where specific architectural elements are required as part of an adopted plan or
associated with local historic guidelines, those guidelines shall supersede any
conflicting design requirements of this chapter.
5.4 Introduction to Building Types
A. Residential Building Types: The general residential buildings types are as follows:
House, Townhouse, and Apartment, including manufactured housing. Adjacent
buildings should relate in similarity of scale, roof pitch, height, architectural
elements, and/or lot configuration.
1. House: A House is a detached building located on one (1) parcel
or lot that is flexible in use, accommodating single-family
residences, multi-family residences up to four units, home
occupations, professional offices, and limited retail uses based on
the zoning district in which it is located. The two basic House
building types  Street-Access House and Alley-Access House 
are a function of how the lot is accessed by automobile.
2. Townhouse: A Townhouse is one of a row of attached houses, or
live-work units, joined by common sidewalls and where each
house/unit is located on an individual parcel or lot. When an
entrance is provided at-grade, the townhouse may be used as a livework
unit. The use permitted within the building is determined by
the district in which it is located. The Townhouse typically has 1
yard (rear) though variations include a small front setback to
provide some landscaping.
3. Apartment: A multiple-unit building containing more than four (4)
dwelling units vertically arranged (generally). The ground floor may
be available for commercial uses. The uses permitted within the
building are determined by the district in which the building is
located. The Apartment building typically has 1 yard (Rear) though
variations include a small front setback to provide some
landscaping.

B. Mixed-Use, Commercial, Institutional, and Public Landmark Building
Types: The mixed-use, commercial, institutional, and public landmark building
types may vary; however, adjacent buildings should relate in similarity of scale, roof
pitch, height, architectural elements, and/or lot configuration.
1. Mixed-Use: A mixed-use building is generally a multi-story, smallscale
structure that can accommodate a variety of uses. A group of
mixed-use buildings can be combined to form a mixed-use
neighborhood center. Individual mixed-use buildings can be used
to provide some commercial service, such as a neighborhood store,
in close proximity to homes. The uses permitted within the
building are determined by the district in which it is located. The
Mixed-Use building typically has 1 yard (Rear) though variations
include a small front plaza or courtyard to provide public space for
outdoor seating as well as a building with complete lot coverage
where parking is handled in a manner other than on-site surface
parking.
2. Commercial: This building type provides convenient pedestrian
and vehicular access from the fronting street, while minimizing the
negative impacts of parking lots on an active pedestrian realm. The
uses permitted within the building are determined by the district in
which it is located. The Commercial building typically has 1 yard
(Rear) though variations include a small front plaza or courtyard to
provide public space for outdoor seating.
3. Institutional: Institutional buildings often serve as landmarks and
public gathering places. However, because most institutional uses
serve specialized populations (i.e. children, elderly, college students,
or the infirmed) they have unique characteristics that require design
control. Institutional buildings should be constructed as permanent
additions to the long-term vibrancy of the City and should serve to
exemplify the very best architectural designs and building practices.
4. Public Landmark: The public landmark building is the most
important building type in the City. It serves equally as a landmark
and a public gathering place. Such buildings should be constructed
as permanent additions to the long-term vibrancy of the City and
should serve to exemplify the very best architectural designs and
building practices.

5.6 General Provisions for All Building Types
A. Building Placement and Orientation
1. Fronting a Street or Public Space: The principal
building shall front a street or recreational open
space. With the provision of alley access, the
principal building may front recreational open
space with street access and shall be of sufficient
design to allow for the provision of emergency
services.
In districts that permit multiple buildings per lot,
accessory and secondary buildings, as defined, may
vary orientation; however, the rear façade, or
service side of any building, shall not front a street
or recreational open space. When there is no clear
or definable principal building, such as in the case
of a shopping center, development is considered a
Campus-Style Development and shall follow the
Conditional District development process.
2. Building Entrances: All buildings shall provide a
primary entrance along the fronting façade, or at
the building corner, and shall be designed for the
pedestrian and be distinguishable from the rest of the building. Additional
entrances may be oriented toward side or rear parking lots. Service
entrances for shipping and receiving shall be oriented away from the street.
(Unless located within a national or local historic district, not applicable to one or two-family
dwellings per N.C.S.L. 2015-86)
3. Termination of Vistas: Important street vistas identified in any adopted
plan should terminate in a focal point, such as a building or other
architectural or natural feature.
4. Campus-Style Development is typically characterized by the clustering of
uses within inwardly-oriented buildings that address one another, a public
common space, or parking area, and where there is generally greater open
space and buffering from surrounding lesser intensive uses. This type of
development typically includes:
a) A unified system of sidewalks, paths, streets, and drives;
b) A unified design of common themes represented in building
design, material, signage, and lighting; and
c) A master utility plan.
A building and its primary entrance façade shall
be oriented toward the street. (5.6.A)
Important street vistas should terminate in a focal
point. (5.6.A)

B. Construction Methods:
1. Underground wiring: To reduce the visual impact of overhead wiring,
utility services shall be located underground.
2. Type of Construction: Manufactured, mobile, and metal units shall be
prohibited, except as may be allowed in Section 4.4 for a temporary office
or classroom, site management, or storage uses during construction
projects, and except as permitted in the RR zoning district or Manufactured
Home Development (MHD) in a Conditional District.
C. Building Height
Building heights are specified in each
building type sections. They shall be
determined according to the provisions
below.
1. Story: That part of a building above
ground level between a floor and
the floor or roof next above shall be
considered a story. A mezzanine
shall be considered a story if it
exceeds one-third of the area of the
floor immediately below. A penthouse shall be considered a story if it
exceeds one-third of the area under the roof. The under-roof area with
dormers does not count as a story.
2. Feet: Some building types regulate height by feet instead of by story. In
those instances, feet shall be measured from the finish grade to the
midpoint of a pitched roof or to the top of a flat roof, not including any
parapet wall.
3. Items Not Included in Calculation:
The height limitations of this
Ordinance shall not apply to
church spires, belfries, cupolas,
and domes not intended for
human occupancy, monuments,
water towers, mechanical
penthouses, (provided they are set
back 20 feet from the front
elevation) observation towers,
transmission and telecom towers,
chimneys, smokestacks,
conveyors, flagpoles, masts and
antennas; provided evidence from
appropriate authorities is
submitted to the effect that such
building or building will not
interfere with any airport zones or flight patterns. As noted above, the

portion of a residential building that is located within a roof area (including
dormers) shall not be counted towards the maximum story requirement.
D. Encroachments
Certain architectural features are permitted to encroach into the setback. The
encroachment standards are as follows:
1. Arcades: Arcades, if provided, shall avoid the swing of car doors parked
parallel to the arcade. In addition the sidewalk within the arcade shall be
sufficient to accommodate the intended uses (i.e. outdoor seating) while
also providing the required clearances according to the American with
Disabilities Act Accessibilities Guidelines (ADAAG).
2. Awnings: All awnings, if provided, shall be supported by a frame attached
directly to the building receiving beneficial use of the awning. Awnings shall
not be supported by a frame attached to the sidewalk or other public rightof-
way.
3. Bay Windows and Overhanging Eaves: Bay windows and overhanging
eaves shall not exceed a maximum projection of two (2) feet from the
primary wall. In addition, bay windows shall not contain habitable floor
space, but may provide seating as an integral element.
4. Balconies, Porches, and Stoops: Roofed or non-roofed balconies,
porches, and stoops are permitted as encroachments. To the extent
possible, these features are to remain visually permeable so that the front
door can be easily seen from the street or sidewalk.
5. Handicapped Ramps: A handicap ramp may encroach into any required
setback.
6. Rear Yard Encroachments: Open decks, porches, patios, and other
similar structures not exceeding an average finished height above grade of
30 inches may encroach into the side and rear setback to within five feet of
the property line. Enclosure of these areas with walls or screening is
considered a room and shall not be permitted as an encroachment.
7. Encroachments over the Public Right of Way: With approval of the
City or NCDOT (whichever has authority over a street), upper story
balconies or bay windows may encroach into the right of way, but shall be a
minimum of 3 feet behind the curb.
8. Public Art: Public art, such as statues, fountains, and other works of art are
encouraged and may be placed in any required setback area.

Chapter 6. LOT, INFILL, ADDITION, AND ACCESSORY PROVISIONS
6.1 Applicability
The following provisions shall apply
throughout the jurisdiction of this Ordinance,
regardless of the underlying zoning district
provisions.
6.2 General Lot Provisions
A. Location of Required Yards:
1. Front Yard: A space extending the full width of the lot between the
architectural front of the principle building façade (the front setback) and the
front lot line or the fronting street right-of-way measured perpendicular to the
building at the closest point to the front lot line. Typically this yard is required to
remain open and unoccupied, with the exception of expressly-permitted
encroachments or structures. Corner lots comprise of two (2) or more front
yards. Therefore, all applicable front yard provisions (including permissions and
prohibitions) are required in both,
or all, front yard areas.
2. Side Yard: A space extending
from the front yard to the rear
yard between the principal
building façade and the side lot
line and measured perpendicular
from the side lot line to the closest
point of the principal building
facade. Side yards extend from the
sides of a building to a street rightof-
way (ROW) or property line.
3. Rear Yard: A space extending
across the full width of the lot
between the architectural rear of the principal building and the rear lot line and
measured perpendicular to the building to the closest point of the rear lot line.
Rear yards extend from the back of a building to a property line.
B. Setbacks along Thoroughfares: Setbacks along thoroughfares shall be measured
from the future right-of-way as determined by the locally adopted Thoroughfare Plan
and/or Long Range Transportation Plan for roadway widening.
C. Reserve Strips: The creation of reserve strips, whether by deed or plat, in such a
manner as to deny access from adjacent property, is prohibited.

D. May Not Reduce/Create Lot(s) Below Minimum Requirements: No yard or lot
existing upon adoption of this Ordinance shall be reduced in size or area below the
minimum requirements of the district. Yards or lots created after the effective date of
this Ordinance shall meet the minimum requirements established by this Ordinance.
This prohibition shall not be construed to prevent the purchase or condemnation of
narrow strips of land or parcels for public utilities, substations, street right-of-way, or
similar purposes.
E. Rights-of-Way Not Considered in Yard Requirements: Rights-of-way or easements
for streets and roads shall not be considered a part of a lot or open space, or front, side,
or rear yards for the purpose of meeting yard requirements.
F. Irregular Lots:
1. Irregular Setbacks: The location of required front, side and rear yards (or
setbacks) on irregularly shaped lots shall be determined by the Administrator.
The determination will be based on the intent and purpose of this Ordinance to
achieve an appropriate spacing and location of buildings and buildings on
individual lots. Where questions arise as to appropriateness, the subdivider may
be requested to provide additional design information.
2. Irregular Lot Width: Irregularly-shaped lots, such as pie-shaped cul-de-sac lots,
shall use the midpoint of the lot depth to determine minimum lot width.
However, irregularly-shaped lots with a lot depth greater than 200 feet shall
determine minimum lot width at a depth of 100 feet from the front yard rightof-
way line.
G. Dimensional Standards for Lots not Served by Public Water and/or Sewer: For
all lots (residential and non-residential) not served by public water and/or sewer service,
the following minimum dimensional standards shall supersede the minimum lot
requirements in this chapter.

B. Applicability
These infill standards shall apply to existing vacant lots of record and any lot of record
further subdivided by any means other than a Major Subdivision. An infill lot shall be
defined as a lot that meets all of the following criteria:
1. The lot is within the GR, UR, HR, or RMX district;
2. There is existing development abutting the lot on at least 50% of its non-street
perimeter. For the purpose of this section, non-street perimeter shall mean
that portion of the perimeter of the lot that is not abutting a public street. Where
there is no abutting public street, the entire perimeter is used for measurement.
C. General Provisions for Infill Compatibility
Some of the infill compatibility standards below require the determination of
comparison lots or structures. The determination and exclusionary procedures are as
follows:
1. Determining Comparison Lots or Structures
a. Use lots or structures along the same block face extending a minimum of
300 feet from the outside corners of the subject lot, including those lots or
structures across local streets but not including those across major or minor
thoroughfares.
b. For corner lots or structures, use lots or structures along the respective
street face extending a minimum distance of 300 feet from the outside
corners of the subject lot, including those lots or structures across local
streets but not including those across major or minor thoroughfares.
c. If the Administrator is unable to determine a comparison lot or comparison
structure, as prescribed above, these infill standards shall not apply.
2. Comparison Lot or Structure Exclusions
a. Lots or structures that are not within the GR, UR, HR, or RMX districts.
b. Lots or structures used for multi-family residential (townhouse or
apartment) or non-residential purposes.
c. Lots or structures where development continuity cannot be provided due to
a natural or man-made barrier; including but not limited to, major or minor
thoroughfares, public land, railroad right-of-way, or waterways

Chapter 7. RECREATIONAL OPEN SPACE
7.1 Purpose and Intent
The intent of this Chapter is to provide for
centrally located, unencumbered land as
neighborhood recreational open space and not
to permit the use of leftover or otherwise
unusable land to fulfill the requirements herein.
Recreational open space as defined by this
Chapter is distinct from those areas that are
environmentally significant and must be protected.
In addition, this chapter is guided by and intends to fulfill the following policy directives of
the Salisbury Vision 2020 Comprehensive Plan:
? Mini parks shall be encouraged in existing and proposed neighborhoods to meet the needs of small
children and to encourage social interaction and mutual support among area families.
? Neighborhoods and mini-parks should be located with exposure to residential and/or non-residential
activities, where informal observation and oversight can take place.
? New residential development should provide for adequate open space and recreation areas in
proportion to the demand created by the development.
7.2 Applicability
All residential and mixed-use residential developments greater than 12 total dwelling units
shall be required to allocate recreational open space. Recreational open space shall be allocated
at the Preliminary Plat (or Final Plat for Minor Subdivisions) phase for the GR, UR, HR, and
RMX districts; and it shall be allocated at the Master Plan phase for a Conditional District
(CD) and a Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND). Allocation shall not be required
until determination of use for the NMX and CMX districts. Residential development in the
Downtown Mixed-Use (DMX) district shall be exempt from these provisions.
7.3 General Provisions
A. Recreational open space is defined as all areas not covered by building lots or parking
lots, dry detention structures, planting yards, streets, or required setbacks.
B. Recreational open space shall be planned and improved, accessible and usable by
persons living nearby. Improved shall mean cleared of underbrush and debris and may
contain one or more of the following enhancements: landscaping, walls, fences, walks,
statues, park benches, utilities, irrigation, fountains, ball fields, tennis courts, swimming
pools, and/or playground equipment.
C. Playground equipment should be located toward the interior of squares and parks away
from the public right-of-way to provide for adequate safety of the user.
D. Recreational open space should provide focal points for the neighborhood and City.

E. A metes and bounds description of the space to be preserved and limits on its use shall
be recorded on the subdivision plan, in homeowner covenants, and on individual deeds
when open space lands are not held entirely in common. Alternative means of
permanent open space preservation may include acceptance by a land conservation
trust or a unit of government. Private management alternatives shall also be permitted.
7.4 Recreational Open Space Ownership
All required recreational open space shall be classified as follows. Other undeveloped spaces
shall not count toward the allocation requirement of this Ordinance.
A. Common Area Recreational Space
Common area recreational open spaces are designed to serve the residents of the
immediate block or neighborhood. Ownership of such common areas shall be in
common ownership by a homeowners association, similar organization, or held in
private ownership with conservation easements recorded in the Rowan County Register
of Deeds in a form approved by the City. The owner shall assume full responsibility for
maintenance. In the event the association or private owner fails to maintain the
common area according to the standards of this Ordinance, the City may, following
reasonable notice:
1. Demand that the deficiency of maintenance be corrected, or
2. Enter the common area open space to perform the required maintenance. The
cost of such maintenance shall be charged to the owning association.
B. Publicly-Owned Recreational Space
Public recreational open spaces shall be dedicated to a local government or non-profit
conservancy organization for ownership and maintenance. Public recreational spaces
shall maintain free and public access. Hours of access may be restricted in accordance
with health and safety guidelines. Recreational open space dedicated to the City of
Salisbury shall be in accordance with the Parks and Recreation Master Plan and
approved by the City Council for ownership and maintenance prior to approval of a
master plan or preliminary plat. Lakes, ponds, creeks, and similar areas within the city
shall be accepted for maintenance only if sufficient land is dedicated as a neighborhood
recreation area or park.

Chapter 8. LANDSCAPING
8.1 Purpose and Intent
This chapter is intended to establish
minimum standards for the preservation and
enhancement of tree canopy, as well as the
design of landscapes so as to improve the
City aesthetically, economically and
environmentally.
This chapter improves the appearance of the
Citys environment through the provision of
trees and landscaping in order to better
control soil erosion; reduce the hazards of
flooding; stabilize the ground water tables;
absorb carbon dioxide; supply oxygen; provide shade for cooling; screen noise and
incompatible uses, dust, glare; and preserve, protect and enhance the natural environment.
In addition, this chapter is guided by and intends to fulfill the following policy directives of
the Salisbury Vision 2020 Comprehensive Plan:
? Large trees, ponds, creeks or other natural features of the landscape should be saved when locating
new streets, buildings, parking lots, etc.
? In planning for new mixed use development, large-scale uses shall be buffered from adjacent
residential areas by smaller scale buildings or by buffer strips. Industries adjoining existing residential
uses shall provide and maintain for adequate screening and buffering.
? Industries located along the citys major travel corridors shall provide for landscaping that enhances
the citys overall image.
? Landscaping, and where possible, street trees should be planted in central median and plaza [or
planting] strips of major streets.
? Consistent street tree species shall occur along predetermined sections of streets. The planting or
preservation of street trees of appropriate size shall be required as part of the upfront costs of new
development.
? The City shall encourage appropriate landscaping and reconfiguration of large, un-landscaped
parking areas.
8.2 Applicability
A. Applies:
1. Applicable provisions of this chapter shall apply to expansion of existing
development and new development requiring Master Plan consideration.

only for the expanded portion of development.
8.3 General Provisions
A. Existing Vegetation, Fences, Walls, and Berms: The use of existing trees or shrubs
to satisfy the landscaping requirements of this chapter is strongly encouraged.
Significant existing vegetation within landscaped areas shall be preserved and credited
towards required landscaping. Existing berms, walls, or fences within the landscaped
area, but not including chain link fencing, may be used to fulfill the standards for the
type of landscaping required, provided that these elements are in a condition of good
repair.
B. Protection of Vegetation during Design: Through the protection of trees and
existing vegetation, the City encourages new or expanded development to be creative in
design and placement of buildings, structures, parking and other impervious surfaces as
to preserve natural features and to complement the existing topography when practical.
C. Installation of New Vegetation and Other Features: New plant material should
complement existing vegetation. If existing significant vegetation and other site features
do not fully meet the standards for the type of landscaping required, then additional
vegetation and/or site features (including fences) shall be planted or installed within the

the original tree.
G. Voluntary Tree Removal & Replacement: Trees planted or protected/preserved on
private property to meet the provisions of this chapter shall not be replaced or
permanently removed without obtaining a Tree Removal & Replacement Permit, which
shall confirm compliance with one of the following provisions or remedies:
1. Replacement: A replacement tree shall meet, or exceed, the current minimum
size or height requirement of the same tree type (shade or ornamental).
2. Permanent Removal: When a tree must be removed and replacement is not
practical, a payment may be made to the City of Salisbury in-lieu of the required
tree being replaced based on the current minimum size or height requirement of
the same tree type (shade or ornamental). The value of the payment shall be
determined on an annual basis by the Community Planning Services department
of the City of Salisbury and approved as part of the annual budget ordinance.
H. Building Setbacks: Building placement within allowable setbacks may supersede
Planting Yard width requirements; however, there shall be no net loss of required
Planting Yard material or points.

landscape plans may require minor revisions. Minor revisions to Landscape Plans may
be approved by the Administrator if:
1. There is no reduction in the quantity of plant material.
2. There is no significant change in size or location of plant materials.
3. The new plants are of the same general category (i.e., shade trees, ornamental
trees, shrubs, groundcover) and have the same general design characteristics
(mature height, crown spread) as the materials being replaced.
8.5 Tree Protection & Preservation
A. Applicability and General Provisions
1. Clearing (aka Clear Cutting): Clearing, defined as the removal or destruction
of 25% or more of the applicable development site trees having a DBH of 4
inches or greater, shall be prohibited unless the clearing is a part of, and
identified on, an approved Preliminary Plat, Schematic Plan, or Master Plan. Up
to 10% of the existing, applicable tree canopy identified on the aforementioned
plan type may be cleared and not subject to the Tree Replacement provisions of
Section 8.6, below. Clearing beyond that threshold shall be subject to the Tree
Replacement provisions for sites experiencing inactivity. Clearing might not
include grubbing or stumping the development site; however, any amount of
clearing shall include complete removal of all fallen and residual debris from the
development site.
B. Landscape Credits for Tree Preservation
1. Credits for tree preservation are available when trees that are proposed for
preservation are clearly identified on the Landscape Plan.
2. Minimum size requirement to qualify for tree preservation is 4 inches (DBH).
3. Landscape credits for existing trees within Planting Yards will be given at the
rate of 12 points per 4 inches in diameter at breast height (DBH) of existing
plant preserved. (See Section 8.6 for details on points for landscaping.)
C. Protection of Existing Vegetation During Construction
1. A tree protection plan, showing there will be no disturbance in the Critical Root
Zone (CRZ), shall be submitted prior to grading. Trenching, placing backfill,
driving, or parking equipment in the CRZ, and the dumping of materials
detrimental to plant health in close proximity of the trees to be preserved is
prohibited.
2. Protective barricades shall be placed around all trees designated to be saved,
prior to the start of development activities or grading.

8.6 Tree Replacement
Although cleared, some development sites will experience delays or complete construction
inactivity. In those instances, and following proper consultation and documentation, the
following replacement/replanting provisions shall apply depending on the level of
construction activity. Substantial progress is defined in Chapter 9, Environmental Protection,
Phase II Stormwater Ordinance:
A. Replanting Cleared Land (No Substantial Progress):
Within 180 days following expiration of an approved plans vesting period, replanting
efforts shall be accomplished using one or more of the following methods:
1. Shade trees listed on the approved Large Trees appendix of the Landscape
Ordinance & Design Guidelines, planted at a minimum of 6 feet to 8 feet tall,
1.5 DBH, and at a rate of at least 36 shade trees per acre.
2. Trees planted in compliance with the NC Cooperative Extension guide for
reforestation, with tree seedlings planted at a minimum rate of one (1) tree per
each 10-foot by 10-foot (10x10) area.
3. As authorized under this section, a payment may be made to the City of
Salisbury in-lieu of replanting. The value of the payment shall be determined on
an annual basis by the Community Planning Services department of the City of
Salisbury and approved as part of the annual budget ordinance. The applicant is
informed of the amount to be paid upon statement of choice to utilize payment
in-lieu in whole or part as a method to comply with these replanting provisions.
Any payment shall be delivered to Development Services within the 180-day
replanting period following closure of the vesting period.
B. Replanting Cleared Land (Substantial Progress): Following determination of
substantial progress and one (1) year of uninterrupted construction inactivity, the city
shall consult with the developer, owner of record, or their assigns, to determine project
viability and a continuation schedule, if found viable. If project viability is unknown and
undetermined, a letter to that fact shall be provided by the developer, owner of record,
or their assigns, and replanting shall consist of planting all required Street Yard trees per
the approved Landscape Plan. If the clearing and substantial progress are related only to
a predevelopment site grading permit, replanting of Street Yard trees shall be in
accordance with the Street Yard provisions of this Ordinance. Infrastructure shall
include roads, driveways, sidewalks, utilities, and stormwater devices.

8.7 Planting Yards
The landscaping regulations established in this section are intended to minimize potential
conflicts between abutting developments, to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as
dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, signs, and unsightly buildings or parking areas, and to ensure
adequate landscaping in new development. New single family and/or duplex development
that is part of a larger common plan is exempt from the provisions of this section.
A. Required Planting Yards
Planting yards shall be required for any development or expansion of existing development.
The planting yard may be a Perimeter or Flexible Planting Yard as described below.
1. Perimeter Planting Yards
The purpose of Perimeter Planting Yards is to ensure that a natural area of
appropriate size and density of plantings is located between certain zoning
districts. (See white boxes in table below)
a. Perimeter Planting Yards require a specific width, type of plant material,
and quantity of plant material.
b. In a mixed-use development, the interior boundaries of abutting
outparcels are not required to meet the Planting Yard requirements.
2. Flexible Planting Yards
The intent of the Flexible Planting Yards is to provide for landscaping of new
development or redevelopment, but to allow for creativity and flexibility in the
placement of the landscaping throughout development sites rather than simply
at the perimeter. (See gray boxes in table below)
Developers shall provide throughout the site the square footage of landscape
area and number of landscape required points that would be equivalent to a
Type-A planting yard along the side and rear portions of the parcel (see 8.6.B,
Planting Yard types). Required planting in street yards and of street trees shall
not count toward the required minimum landscaping.

comply with this section and the requirements for Planting Yards (Section 8.6)
and Street Yards (Section 8.7).
2. Existing parking lots (paved or unpaved) that are expanded or improved to add
12 or more spaces shall comply with the landscaping requirements of this
section within the expanded or improved portion only.
B. Planting Yards:
1. If a perimeter planting yard is not otherwise required or provided around new or
expanded parking lots, a Type-A planting yard shall be provided along the
perimeter portion of parking lots that abut an adjacent property. These points
may contribute towards the overall yard requirement.
2. Parking lot connections up to 24-feet wide between adjacent properties shall be
exempt from the Planting Yard requirements.
C. Street Frontages: Parking areas located along a street frontage shall have the portion
of the lot that fronts the street screened up to a height of 3 feet using shrubs, brick
walls (using brick that matches the adjacent building), wrought iron-type fencing, or any
combination thereof. There shall be no openings in the screening greater than 2 feet
except openings for pedestrian passage, which should be at least 5 feet in width. If
landscaping is used, the minimum planting area width shall not be less than 4 feet.
Where a street yard is provided, per Section 8.7, no additional landscape width beyond
the width of the street yard shall be required. However, screening requirements shall be
met within the street yard area.
D. Interior Parking Lot Landscaping:
1. In parking lots with 12 or more spaces, trees shall be planted at a rate of one
Shade Tree for every 12 spaces or fraction thereof. Ornamental Trees may be

8.12 Alternate Methods of Compliance
Alternate landscaping plans, plant materials, or planting methods may be used where
unreasonable or impractical situations would result from application of landscaping
requirements, or where necessary to protect existing vegetation. Such situations may result
from streams, natural rock formations, topography, or other physical conditions; or from lot
configuration, utility easements, unified development design, or unusual site conditions.
A. Approval of Alternate Plan
The applicable approval authority may approve an alternate plan which proposes
different plant materials or methods provided that the quality, effectiveness, durability,
and performance are equivalent to that required by this Ordinance.
B. Appeal
Decisions of the applicable approval authority regarding alternate methods of
compliance may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
C. Non-Compliance
In the event of a taking of right-of-way that puts a property in non-compliance, the
property shall come back into compliance as it was previous to the taking. If coming
into compliance presents a hardship for the property owner, then the property owner
may present an alternate method of compliance.
8.13 Plant Substitution
Due to seasonal planting problems and a lack of plant availability, approved landscape plans
may require minor revisions. Minor revisions to planting plans may be approved by the
Administrator or designee if:
A. There is no reduction in the quantity of plant material.
B. There is no significant change in size or location of plant materials.
C. The new plants are of the same general category (i.e., Shade Tree, Ornamental Tree,
Evergreen, or Shrub) and have the same general design characteristics (mature height,
crown spread) as the materials being replaced.

9.5 Flood Damage Protection Ordinance
The Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance is codified into the City of Salisbury Land
Development Ordinance as Appendix C.
9.6 Watershed Protection Ordinance
A. General Provisions
1. Authority
The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has, in Chapter 160A, Article
Section 174, General Code Authority; and in Chapter 143, Article 21,
Watershed Protection Rules, delegated the responsibility or directed local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. The City Council of
Salisbury enacted into law the following sections as the Watershed Protection
Code of the City of Salisbury as adopted on June 22, 1972.
2. Jurisdiction and Coordination with Other Codes
The provisions of this Chapter shall apply only to those lands within the City
of Salisbury corporate boundaries and extraterritorial jurisdictional limits that
have been designated as a Public Water Supply Watershed by the NC
Environmental Management Commission. These areas are identified by the
overlay districts as established on the City of Salisburys Watershed Overlay
District:
Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO)
The requirements stated in this Chapter shall supersede all other applicable
codes enumerated in this Ordinance, unless otherwise provided.
3. Rules Governing the Interpretation of Watershed Area Boundaries
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of the watershed areas, as shown
on the Watershed Map, the following rules shall apply:
a. Area boundaries approximately following street, alley, railroad or highway
lines or centerlines thereof shall be construed to be these boundaries.
b. Area boundaries approximately following lot lines, such lot lines shall be
construed to be these boundaries. However, a surveyed plat prepared by
a registered land surveyor may be submitted confirming that properties
along these boundaries do not lie within the watershed area.
c. The watershed area boundaries shall be determined by using the scale on
the map where the boundaries lie at a scaled distance more than twentyfive
(25) feet from any parallel lot line.

a. These regulations are not intended to interfere with any easement,
covenants or other agreements. However, if these provisions impose
greater restrictions or higher standards then the provisions of these
regulations shall control.
b. Existing development, as defined in this Ordinance, is not subject to the
requirements of this Section. Expansions to structures classified as
existing development shall meet the requirements of this Section;
however, the built-upon area of the existing development is not required
to be included in the density calculations.
c. Uses of Land. This category consists of uses existing at the time of
adoption of this Ordinance where such use of the land is not permitted
to be established hereafter in the watershed area in which it is located.
Such uses may be continued except as follows:
(1) When such use of land has been changed to an allowed use, it shall
not thereafter revert to any prohibited use.
(2) Such use of land shall be changed only to an allowed use.
(3) When such use ceases for a period of at least one year, it shall not
be reestablished.
d. Reconstruction of Buildings or Built-upon Areas. Any existing
building or built-upon area not in conformance with the restrictions of
this Ordinance that has been damaged or removed may be repaired
and/or reconstructed, except that there are no restrictions on single
family residential development, provided:
(1) Repair or reconstruction is initiated within twelve (12) months and
completed within two (2) years of such damage.
(2) The total amount of space devoted to built-upon area may not be
increased unless stormwater control that equals or exceeds the

B. Definitions
"Agricultural Use" means the use of waters for stock watering, irrigation, and other
farm purposes.
"Best Management Practices (BMP)" means a structural or nonstructural
management-based practice used singularly or in combination to reduce non-point
source inputs to receiving waters in order to achieve water quality protection goals.
"Buffer" means an area of natural or planted vegetation through which stormwater
runoff flows in a diffuse manner so that the runoff does not become channelized
and which provides for infiltration of the runoff and filtering of pollutants. The
buffer is measured landward from the normal pool elevation of impounded
structures and from the bank of each side of streams or rivers.
"Building" means any structure having a roof supported by columns or by walls, and
intended for shelter, housing or enclosure of persons, animals or property. The
connection of two buildings by means of an open porch, breezeway, passageway,
carport or other such open structure, with or without a roof, shall not be deemed to
make them one building.
"Built-upon area" means built-upon areas shall include that portion of a development
project that is covered by impervious or partially impervious cover including
buildings, pavement, gravel areas (e.g. roads, parking lots, paths), recreation facilities
(e.g. tennis courts), etc. (Note: Wooden slatted decks and the water area of a
swimming pool are considered pervious.)
"Cluster Development" means the grouping of buildings in order to conserve land
resources and provide for innovation in the design of the project including
minimizing stormwater runoff impacts. This term includes nonresidential
development as well as single-family residential and multi-family developments. For
the purpose of this Ordinance, planned unit developments and mixed use
development are considered as cluster development.

SALISBURY, NC LAND DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE
ADOPTED DECEMBER 18, 2007; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008
"Critical Area" means the area adjacent to a water supply intake or reservoir where
risk associated with pollution is greater than from the remaining portions of the
watershed. The critical area is defined as extending either one-half mile from the
normal pool elevation of the reservoir in which the intake is located or to the ridge
line of the watershed (whichever comes first); or one-half mile upstream from the
intake located directly in the stream or river (run-of-the-river), or the ridge line of the
watershed (whichever comes first). Local governments may extend the critical area as
needed. Major landmarks such as highways or property lines may be used to
delineate the outer boundary of the critical area if these landmarks are immediately
adjacent to the appropriate outer boundary of one-half mile.
"Customary Home Occupations" means any use conducted entirely within a dwelling
and carried on by the occupants thereof, which use is clearly incidental and
secondary to the use of the dwelling for residential purposes and does not change the
character thereof. Provided further that no mechanical equipment is installed or used
except as is normally used for domestic or professional purposes, and that not over
twenty-five percent (25%) of the total floor space of any structure is used for the
occupation. No home occupation shall be conducted in any accessory building
except for the storage and service of a vehicle that is driven off site, such as a service
repair truck, delivery truck, etc.
"Development" means any land disturbing activity which adds to or changes the
amount of impervious or partially impervious cover on a land area or which
otherwise decreases the infiltration of precipitation into the soil.
"Dwelling Unit" means a building, or portion thereof, providing complete and
permanent living facilities for one family.
"Existing Development" means those projects that are built or those projects that at
a minimum have established a vested right under North Carolina zoning law as of
the effective date of this Ordinance based on at least one of the following criteria:
(1) substantial expenditures of resources (time, labor, money) based on a good

The remainder of the tract shall remain in a vegetated or natural state.
The title to the open space area shall be conveyed to an incorporated
homeowners association for management; to a local government for
preservation as a park or open space; or to a conservation organization
for preservation in a permanent easement. Where a property association
is not incorporated, a maintenance agreement shall be filed with the
property deeds.
d. Cluster developments that meet the applicable low1 density requirements
shall transport stormwater runoff by vegetated conveyances to the
maximum extent practicable.
5. Buffer Areas Required
A minimum one hundred (100) foot vegetative buffer is required for all new
development activities that exceed the low density option; otherwise, a
minimum thirty (30) foot vegetative buffer for development activities is
required along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions of
U.S.G.S. 1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined by
local government studies. Desirable artificial streambank or shoreline
stabilization is permitted.
No new development is allowed in the buffer except for water dependent
structures, other structures such as flag poles, signs and security lights which
result in only diminutive increases in impervious area and public projects such
as road crossings and greenways where no practical alternative exists. These
activities should minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from the
surface waters and maximize the utilization of stormwater Best Management
Practices.
1 Development that uses the 10/70% provision, as allowed in WS-II and III, is considered high density development and
thus a 100 foot vegetated buffer is required.

SALISBURY, NC LAND DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE
ADOPTED DECEMBER 18, 2007; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008
9.7 Phase II Stormwater Ordinance
A. Title
This section and related sections shall officially be known as the Phase II
Stormwater Ordinance. It is referred to herein as the Stormwater Ordinance.
B. Authority
The City of Salisbury is authorized to adopt this Ordinance pursuant to North
Carolina law, including but not limited to Article 14, Section 5 of the Constitution of
North Carolina; the municipal Charter of the City of Salisbury; North Carolina
General Statutes 143-214.7 and rules promulgated by the Environmental
Management Commission thereunder; Session Law 2004-163; Chapter 160A, §§ 174,
185 [as well as Chapter 113A, Article 4 (Sedimentation Pollution Control)]; [Article
21, Part 6 (Floodway Regulation)]; [Chapter 160A, Article 19 (Planning and
Regulation of Development); Chapter 153A, Article 18]; as well as Chapter 153A,
Article 18 related to statutory authority for planning and regulation of development
(Parts 1, 2, and 3), including particularly but not limited to G.S. 153A-324
(enforcement), G.S. 153A-330 and 331 (subdivision), G.S. 153A-340 (zoning).
C. Findings
It is hereby determined that:
Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds
and increases stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream
channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and sediment transport and
deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge;
These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne
pollutants and alterations in hydrology which are harmful to public health and
safety as well as to the natural environment; and
These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned
controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites.
Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (Clean Water Act) and
federal Phase II Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the North
Carolina Environmental Management Commission promulgated in response to
federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas, including this
jurisdiction, to adopt the minimum stormwater controls such as those included in
this Ordinance.
Therefore, the City of Salisbury establishes this set of water quality and quantity
regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of
stormwater runoff and discharge.

D. Purpose
1. General
The purpose of this Ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the public
health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum
requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment
stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution
associated with new development and redevelopment [as well as illicit
discharges into municipal stormwater systems]. It has been determined that
proper management of construction-related and post-development stormwater
runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure,
safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare, and protect water and
aquatic resources.
2. Specific
This Ordinance seeks to meet its general purpose through the following
specific objectives and means:
a. Establishing decision-making processes for development that protects
the integrity of watersheds and preserves the health of water resources;
b. Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment
hydrologic response in their post-development state as
nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm in order to reduce
flooding, stream bank erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution and
increases in stream temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream
channels and aquatic habitats;
c. Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management
standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater
runoff quantity and quality;
d. Establishing design and review criteria for the construction, function, and
use of structural stormwater BMPs that may be used to meet the
minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
e. Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices, such
as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation
of green space and other conservation areas to the maximum extent
practicable;
f. Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and
maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure
that they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately,
and pose no threat to public safety;
CHAPTER 9: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
9-26
SALISBURY, NC LAND DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE
ADOPTED DECEMBER 18, 2007; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008
g. Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review,
approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, for the
inspection of approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term
maintenance.
h. Coordinating site design plans that include open space and natural areas
with the (name of the open space and natural areas protection plan of the
local government, or the section of its comprehensive plan dealing with
open space/natural areas, if applicable).
i. Controlling illicit discharges into the municipal separate stormwater
system.
j. Controlling erosion and sedimentation from construction activities.
k. Assigning responsibility and processes for approving the creation and
maintenance of adequate drainage and flood damage prevention.

included within the meaning of owner under another description in this definition,
such as a management entity.
"Redevelopment" means any rebuilding activity other than a rebuilding activity that
results in no net increase in built-upon area and provides equal or greater stormwater
control than the previous development.
"Structural BMP" means a physical device designed to trap, settle out, or filter
pollutants from stormwater runoff; to alter or reduce stormwater runoff velocity,
amount, timing, or other characteristics; to approximate the pre-development
hydrology on a developed site; or to achieve any combination of these goals.
Structural BMP includes physical practices such as constructed wetlands, vegetative
practices, filter strips, grassed swales, and other methods installed or created on real
property. Structural BMP is synonymous with structural practice, stormwater

3. Applications for Approval
a. Concept Plan and Consultation Meeting. Before a stormwater
management permit application is deemed complete, the Stormwater
Administrator or developer may request a consultation on a concept plan
for the post-construction stormwater management system to be utilized
in the proposed development project. This consultation meeting should
take place at the time of the preliminary plan of subdivision or other early
step in the development process. The purpose of this meeting is to
discuss the post-construction stormwater management measures
necessary for the proposed project, as well as to discuss and assess
constraints, opportunities and potential approaches to stormwater
management designs before formal site design engineering is
commenced. Local watershed plans, the City of Salisburys Park and
Recreation Master Plan, and other relevant resource protection plans may be
consulted in the discussion of the concept plan.
To accomplish this goal the following information should be included in
the concept plan, which should be submitted in advance of the meeting:
(1) Existing Conditions/Proposed Site Plans: Existing conditions
and proposed site layout sketch plans, which illustrate at a
minimum: existing and proposed topography; perennial and
intermittent streams; mapping of predominant soils from soil
surveys (when available); boundaries of existing predominant
vegetation and proposed limits of clearing and grading; and
location of existing and proposed roads, buildings, parking areas
and other impervious surfaces.
(2) Natural Resources Inventory: A written or graphic inventory of
the natural resources at the site and surrounding area as it exists
prior to the commencement of the project. This description should
include a discussion of soil conditions, forest cover, geologic
features, topography, wetlands, and native vegetative areas on the
site, as well as the location and boundaries of other natural feature
protection and conservation areas such as lakes, ponds,
floodplains, stream buffers and other setbacks (e.g., drinking water
well setbacks, septic setbacks, etc.). Particular attention should be
paid to environmentally sensitive features that provide particular
opportunities or constraints for development.
(3) Stormwater Management System Concept Plan: A written or
graphic concept plan of the proposed post-development
stormwater management system including: preliminary selection
and location of proposed structural stormwater controls; low
impact design elements; location of existing and proposed
conveyance systems such as grass channels, swales, and storm
drains; flow paths; location of floodplain/floodway limits;
relationship of site to upstream and downstream properties and
CHAPTER 9: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

drainages; and preliminary location of proposed stream channel
modifications, such as bridge or culvert crossings.
b. Stormwater Management Permit Application. The stormwater
management permit application shall detail how post-development
stormwater runoff will be controlled and managed and how the proposed
project will meet the requirements of this Ordinance, including Section
M, Standards. All such plans shall be prepared by a qualified registered
North Carolina professional engineer, surveyor, soil scientist or landscape
architect, and the engineer, surveyor, soil scientist or landscape architect
shall perform services only in their area of competence, and shall verify
that the design of all stormwater management facilities and practices
meets the submittal requirements for complete applications, that the
designs and plans are sufficient to comply with applicable standards and
policies found in the Design Manual, and that the designs and plans
ensure compliance with this Ordinance.
The submittal shall include all of the information required in the
submittal checklist established by the Stormwater Administrator.
c. As-Built Plans and Final Approvals. Upon completion of a project,
and before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted, the applicant shall
certify that the completed project is in accordance with the approved
stormwater management plans and designs, and shall submit actual as
built plans for all stormwater management facilities or practices after
final construction is completed.
The plans shall show the final design specifications for all stormwater
management facilities and practices and the field location, size, depth, and
planted vegetation of all measures, controls, and devices, as installed. The
designer of the stormwater management measures and plans shall certify,
under seal, that the as-built stormwater measures, controls, and devices
are in compliance with the approved stormwater management plans and
designs and with the requirements of this Ordinance. A final inspection
and approval by the Stormwater Administrator shall occur before the
release of any performance securities.
d. Other Permits. No certificate of compliance or occupancy shall be
issued by the City of Salisbury Zoning Administrator without final asbuilt
plans and a final inspection and approval by the Stormwater
Administrator, except where multiple units are served by the stormwater
practice or facilities, in which case the Rowan County Building Inspector
may elect to withhold a percentage of permits or certificates of
occupancy until as-built plans are submitted and final inspection and
approval has occurred.

CHAPTER 9: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
9-42
SALISBURY, NC LAND DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE
ADOPTED DECEMBER 18, 2007; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008
the original owner or applicant shall have primary responsibility for
carrying out the provisions of the maintenance agreement.
The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner or
owners to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the structural
BMP, and shall state the terms, conditions, and schedule of maintenance
for the structural BMP. In addition, it shall grant to the City of Salisbury
a right of entry in the event that the Administrator has reason to believe
it has become necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or
reconstruct the structural BMP; however, in no case shall the right of
entry, of itself, confer an obligation on the City of Salisbury to assume
responsibility for the structural BMP.
The operation and maintenance agreement shall be approved by the
Administrator prior to plan approval, and it shall be referenced on the
final plat and shall be recorded with the county Register of Deeds upon
final plat approval. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall
be given to the Administrator within fourteen (14) days following its
recordation.
b. Special Requirement for Homeowners and Other Associations.
For all structural BMPs required pursuant to this Ordinance and that are
to be or are owned and maintained by a homeowners association,
property owners association, or similar entity, the required operation and
maintenance agreement shall include all of the following provisions:
(1) Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously operate
and maintain the stormwater control and management facilities.
(2) Establishment of an escrow account, which can be spent solely for
sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement,
major repair, or reconstruction of the structural BMPs. If structural
BMPs are not performing adequately or as intended or are not
properly maintained, the City of Salisbury, in its sole discretion,
may remedy the situation, and in such instances the City of
Salisbury shall be fully reimbursed from the escrow account.
Escrowed funds may be spent by the association for sediment
removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major
repair, and reconstruction of the structural BMPs, provided that
the City of Salisbury shall first consent to the expenditure.
(3) Both developer contribution and annual sinking funds shall fund
the escrow account. Prior to plat recordation or issuance of
construction permits, whichever shall first occur, the developer
shall pay into the escrow account an amount equal to fifteen (15)
per cent of the initial construction cost of the structural BMPs.
Two-thirds (2/3) of the total amount of sinking fund budget shall
be deposited into the escrow account within the first five (5) years
and the full amount shall be deposited within ten (10) years
following initial construction of the structural BMPs. Funds shall
be deposited each year into the escrow account. A portion of the
CHAPTER 9: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
SALISBURY, NC LAND DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE
ADOPTED DECEMBER 18, 2007; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008
9-43
annual assessments of the association shall include an allocation
into the escrow account. Any funds drawn down from the escrow
account shall be replaced in accordance with the schedule of
anticipated work used to create the sinking fund budget.
(4) The percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to fund
the escrow account may be varied by the City of Salisbury
depending on the design and materials of the stormwater control
and management facility.
(5) Granting to the City of Salisbury a right of entry to inspect,
monitor, maintain, repair, and reconstruct structural BMPs.
(6) Allowing the City of Salisbury to recover from the association and
its members any and all costs the City of Salisbury expends to
maintain or repair the structural BMPs or to correct any
operational deficiencies. Failure to pay the City of Salisbury all of
its expended costs, after forty-five days written notice, shall
constitute a breach of the agreement. The City of Salisbury shall
thereafter be entitled to bring an action against the association and
its members to pay, or foreclose upon the lien hereby authorized
by the agreement against the property, or both, in case of a
deficiency. Interest, collection costs, and attorney fees shall be
added to the recovery.
(7) A statement that this agreement shall not obligate the (name of
local government) to maintain or repair any structural BMPs, and
the (name of local government) shall not be liable to any person
for the condition or operation of structural BMPs.
(8) A statement that this agreement shall not in any way diminish,
limit, or restrict the right of the City of Salisbury to enforce any of
its Ordinances as authorized by law.
(9) A provision indemnifying and holding harmless the (name of local
government) for any costs and injuries arising from or related to
the structural BMP, unless the City of Salisbury has agreed in
writing to assume the maintenance responsibility for the BMP and
has accepted dedication of any and all rights necessary to carry out
that maintenance.
3. Inspection Program
Inspections and inspection programs by the City of Salisbury may be
conducted or established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to
routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints
or other notice of possible violations; and joint inspections with other agencies
inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but
are not limited to, reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling
discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in BMPs; and
evaluating the condition of BMPs.

ADOPTED DECEMBER 18, 2007; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008
If the owner or occupant of any property refuses to permit such inspection,
the Administrator shall proceed to obtain an administrative search warrant
pursuant to G.S. 15-27.2 or its successor. No person shall obstruct, hamper or
interfere with the Administrator while carrying out his or her official duties.
4. Performance Security for Installation and Maintenance
a. May Be Required. The City of Salisbury may, at its discretion, require
the submittal of a performance security or bond with surety, cash escrow,
letter of credit or other acceptable legal arrangement prior to issuance of
a permit in order to ensure that the structural BMPs are:
(1) installed by the permit holder as required by the approved
stormwater management plan, and/or
(2) maintained by the owner as required by the operation and
maintenance agreement.
b. Amount:
(1) Installation: The amount of an installation performance security
shall be the total estimated construction cost of the BMPs
approved under the permit, plus 25%.
(2) Maintenance: The amount of a maintenance performance security
shall be the present value of an annuity of perpetual duration based
on a reasonable estimate of the annual cost of inspection,
operation and maintenance of the BMPs approved under the
permit, at a discount rate that reflects the jurisdictions cost of
borrowing minus a reasonable estimate of long term inflation.
c. Uses of Performance Security:
(1) Forfeiture Provisions
The performance security shall contain forfeiture provisions for
failure, after proper notice, to complete work within the time
specified, or to initiate or maintain any actions which may be
required of the applicant or owner in accordance with this
Ordinance, approvals issued pursuant to this Ordinance, or an
operation and maintenance agreement established pursuant to this
Ordinance.
(2) Default
Upon default of the owner to construct, maintain, repair and, if
necessary, reconstruct any structural BMP in accordance with the
applicable permit or operation and maintenance agreement, the
Stormwater Administrator shall obtain and use all or any portion
of the security to make necessary improvements based on an
CHAPTER 9: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
SALISBURY, NC LAND DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE
ADOPTED DECEMBER 18, 2007; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008
9-45
engineering estimate. Such expenditure of funds shall only be made
after requesting the owner to comply with the permit or
maintenance agreement. In the event of a default triggering the use
of installation performance security, the City of Salisbury shall not
return any of the unused deposited cash funds or other security,
which shall be retained for maintenance.
(3) Costs in Excess of Performance Security
If City of Salisbury takes action upon such failure by the applicant
or owner, the City of Salisbury may collect from the applicant or
owner for the difference should the amount of the reasonable cost
of such action exceed the amount of the security held.
(4) Refund
Within sixty days of the final approval, the installation performance
security shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated, with the
exception of any amount attributable to the cost (plus 25%) of
landscaping installation and ongoing maintenance associated with
the BMPs covered by the security. Any such landscaping shall be
inspected one (1) year after installation with replacement for
compliance with the approved plans and specifications and, if in
compliance, the portion of the financial security attributable to
landscaping shall be released.
5. Notice to Owners
a. Deed Recordation and Indications On Plat: The applicable
operations and maintenance agreement, conservation easement, or
dedication and acceptance into public maintenance (whichever is
applicable) pertaining to every structural BMP shall be referenced on the
final plat and shall be recorded with the county Register of Deeds upon
final plat approval. If no subdivision plat is recorded for the site, then the
operations and maintenance agreement, conservation easement, or
dedication and acceptance into public maintenance, whichever is
applicable shall be recorded with the county Register of Deeds so as to
appear in the chain of title of all subsequent purchasers under generally
accepted searching principles.
b. Signage: Where appropriate in the determination of the Stormwater
Administrator to assure compliance with this Ordinance, structural BMPs
shall be posted with a conspicuous sign stating who is responsible for
required maintenance and annual inspection. The sign shall be maintained
so as to remain visible and legible.
6. Records of Installation and Maintenance Activities. The owner of each

corrected within the specified time limit for reasons beyond the control
of the person requesting the extension, the Stormwater Administrator
may extend the time limit as is reasonably necessary to allow timely
correction of the violation, up to, but not exceeding 30 days. The
Stormwater Administrator may grant 30-day extensions in addition to the
foregoing extension if the violation cannot be corrected within the
permitted time due to circumstances beyond the control of the person
violating this Ordinance. The Stormwater Administrator may grant an
extension only by written notice of extension. The notice of extension
shall state the date prior to which correction must be made, after which
the violator will be subject to the penalties described in the notice of
violation and correction order.
e. Enforcement after Time to Correct: After the time has expired to
correct a violation, including any extension(s) if authorized by the
Stormwater Administrator, the Stormwater Administrator shall determine
if the violation is corrected. If the violation is not corrected, the
Stormwater Administrator may act to impose one or more of the
remedies and penalties authorized by this Ordinance.
f. Emergency Enforcement: If delay in correcting a violation would
seriously threaten the effective enforcement of this Ordinance or pose an
immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, then the
Stormwater Administrator may order the immediate cessation of a
violation. Any person so ordered shall cease any violation immediately.
The Stormwater Administrator may seek immediate enforcement,
without prior written notice, through any remedy or penalty authorized
by this section.

Chapter 11. LIGHTING ON PRIVATE PROPERTY
11.1 Purpose and Intent
The purpose of this Chapter is to control light spillage and
glare so as not to adversely affect motorists, pedestrians, and
uses of adjacent properties. Lighting intensities should be
controlled to assure that excessive light spillage and glare are
not directed at adjacent properties, neighboring areas, and
motorists. Levels of illumination to achieve a certain function
or desired effect should also reduce or eliminate the
hazardous aspects and nuisance of glare and light spillage.
In addition, this chapter is guided by and intends to fulfill the following policy directives of
the Salisbury Vision 2020 Comprehensive Plan:
? Neighborhood serving businesses shall be permitted to have only residential scale signage and lighting.
11.2 Administration
A. Applicability: The provisions of this chapter shall apply to exterior lighting on private
property for commercial and multi-family development. All exterior lighting that is
used around buildings, recreation areas, parking lots, and signs shall be designed to
protect against the spillage of light to adjacent properties.
B. Lighting Plan: Any person submitting a site plan or applying for a zoning or sign
permit to install outdoor lighting fixtures shall submit a lighting plan showing evidence
that the proposed work will comply with this chapter. The Lighting Plan shall comply
with the requirements of Section 16.11, Lighting Plan Requirements.
C. Measurement: Light level measurements shall be made at the property line of the
property upon which the light to be measured is being generated. If measurement on
private property is not possible or practical, light level measurements may be made at
the boundary of the public street right-of-way that adjoins the property. Measurements
shall be made at finished grade (ground level), with the light-registering portion of the
meter held parallel to the ground and pointing upward. Lighting levels are to be
measured in foot-candles with a direct reading, portable light meter.
D. Exemptions:
1. Single-family and duplex development.
2. Lighting of the United States of America or State of North Carolina flags and
other non-commercial flags expressing constitutionally protected speech.
Current official flags of the United States of America, State of North Carolina,
County of Rowan, and City of Salisbury are permitted by right. Whenever these
flags are used, they should follow the Federal Flag Code whenever possible. The
Federal Flag Code was established by Congress on July 7, 1976  Public Law 94-
344, 94th Congress, S. J. Res 49.
3. Circus, fair, carnival, or other City Council recognized civic or community event.

11.3 Outdoor Lighting Provisions
A. Outdoor lighting shall not shine directly into the yard or into the windows of an
adjacent residence.
B. Outdoor lighting shall be designed, located, and mounted at heights no greater than
eighteen (18) feet above grade for pedestrian lights, or thirty-five (35) feet above grade
for street or parking area lights.
C. All outdoor lighting shall be designed and located such that the maximum illumination
measured in foot-candles at the property line shall not exceed one (1.0) foot candle.
This provision is not applicable in the DMX district except where DMX is adjacent to
RMX, HR, UR-12, UR-8, GR-6, and GR-3 districts.
D. To avoid light spillage, only downward-directed semi-cutoff, cutoff, or full cutoff
fixtures shall be used.
E. Floodlights shall be hooded or shielded so that the light source is not visible from any
public right-of-way or adjacent property.
F. Flickering, rotating, or flashing lights, or search lights are prohibited.
G. Wall Packs on the exterior of the building shall be fully shielded (true cut-off type-bulb
or light source not visible from off-site) to direct the light downward and be of low
wattage (preferably 100 watts or lower). Other accent lighting projected onto buildings
may be allowed provided that it is approved through the development plan process.
H. Internally-illuminated translucent (i.e. glowing) canopies used for building accents over
doors, windows, etc. are prohibited.
I. Outdoor Recreational Lighting: Because of their unique requirements for nighttime
visibility and limited hours of operation, the lighting of active recreation areas, such as
for ball fields and tennis courts are not considered in this chapter. However, lighting
fixtures for such uses shall be mounted and aimed so that the illumination falls within
the primary playing area and immediate surroundings so that no direct light
illumination is directed off site.

Chapter 12. SIGNS
12.1 General Purpose
These regulations balance the need to protect the
public safety and welfare, the need for a wellmaintained
and attractive community, and the need
for adequate identification, communication, and
advertising. The provisions for signs have the
following specific objectives:
? To ensure that signs are designed, constructed, installed
and maintained according to minimum standards to
safeguard life, health, property and public welfare;
? To allow and promote positive conditions for sign
communication;
? To reflect and support the desired ambience and
development patterns of the various zones, overlay zones,
and plan districts and promote an attractive
environment;
? To allow for adequate and effective signs whose
dimensional characteristics further the interests of public
safety and the needs of the motorist, where signs are
viewed from a street or roadway, and
? To ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed right of free expression is protected.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the construction, erection, alteration, use, type,
number, location, size, height, and maintenance of all signs.
12.2 Applicability
The provisions of this Ordinance apply to all signs, sign structures, and other types of sign
devices located within the City of Salisbury zoning jurisdiction, except when specifically
stated elsewhere in this Ordinance.
These provisions allow adequate communication through signage while encouraging
aesthetic quality in the design, location, size, and purpose of all signs. These provisions must
be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If
any provision is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding must
not affect the validity of other provisions of this Ordinance, which can be given effect
without the invalid provision.

12.8 Sign Area
A. Sign cabinets. The area of sign faces enclosed in frames or cabinets is determined
based on the outer dimensions of the frame or cabinet
B. Double-faced signs. Only one (1) side of a double-faced sign is counted in
determining the area of sign faces. Where the two (2) sides are not of equal size, the
larger of the two (2) sides is used for the determination of sign area.
C. The area of multiple-faced signs in which the interior angle formed by the faces is
greater than ninety-one degrees (91°) shall be expressed as the sum of the areas of
all the faces, except for multiple-faced signs containing faces that are configured
back to back, in which case the area of the faces configured back to back will be
calculated according to the rule for double-faced signs.
D. Round, Oval and Irregularly Shaped Signs. To be measured based on the
appropriate mathematical formula to obtain the sign area for a circle, an oval or
irregularly shaped sign.
E. Calculating Sign Area
1) Signs containing integral background areas: The area of a sign containing a
clearly defined background area shall be calculated based on the area of the
smallest standard geometric shape or combination of geometric shapes
capable of encompassing the perimeter of the background area of the sign.
In the case of signs in which multiple background areas are separated by
open space, sign area shall be calculated based on the sum of the areas of all
separate background areas, calculated as referenced above, but without
regard for any open space between the separate background areas.
2) Signs without integral background areas: In instances in which a sign
consists of individual elements such as letters, symbols, or other graphic
objects or representations that are painted, attached to, or otherwise affixed
to a surface such as a wall, window, canopy, awning, architectural
projection, or to any surface not specifically designed to serve as a sign
background, the sign area shall be based on the sum of the individual areas
of the smallest geometric shape or combination of geometric shapes
capable of encompassing the perimeters of the individual elements
comprising the sign.
F. Awnings and marquees. When graphics or sign copy is incorporated into an
awning, the sign area is determined by computing the area of a standard imaginary
geometric shape or combination of shapes drawn around the sign copy area or
graphics. When the ends of awnings or marquees are parallel and contain graphics
or sign copy, only one side is counted in addition to the sign face area on the front.

Chapter 13. NONCONFORMITIES
13.1 Purpose and Applicability
The purpose of this section is to
regulate and limit the continued
existence of uses and structures
established prior to the effective date of
this Ordinance (or any subsequent
amendment) that do not conform to
this Ordinance. Any nonconformity
created by a change in the classification
of property or the text of these
regulations shall also be regulated by the
provisions of this section. Many
nonconformities may continue, but the
provisions of this section are intended
and designed to limit substantial investment in nonconformities and to bring about eventual
elimination and/or lessen their impact upon surrounding conforming uses in order to
preserve the integrity of the area in which it is located.
13.2 Summary Applicability Matrix
The following table summarizes the primary requirements that shall be met when there are
changes to nonconforming structures. A ? indicates that compliance with all applicable
standards is required.

13.3 Nonconforming Uses
A. Nonconforming uses of land or structures, and nonconforming structures that contain
nonconforming uses may continue only in accordance with the provisions of this
section, but this section shall only apply to the extent these or such nonconformities
fully and clearly meet the definition of non-conforming use in Chapter 18 of this
Ordinance.
B. A nonconforming use shall not be expanded, changed or enlarged, nor shall such a
nonconforming use be enlarged by additions to the structure in which the
nonconforming use is located (either attached or detached). Any occupation of
additional lands beyond the boundaries of the lot on which the nonconforming use is
located is prohibited.
C. A nonconforming use may make necessary alterations to enhance the health, safety,
and general welfare of the community by mitigating environmental impacts to air,
ground, or water quality; however, these necessary alterations shall not expand or
enlarge the nonconforming use.
D. Once a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not revert or
be used for any nonconforming use.
E. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period equal to or exceeding one
hundred-eighty (180) consecutive calendar days, the use shall not be re-established.
F. An abandoned nonconforming use shall not be re-established; however, a
nonconforming use that has not been abandoned may be reinstated. For the purpose
of this Ordinance, intent of resumption shall be considered when determining
abandonment.
13.4 Nonconforming Principal Structures and Building Types
A. Routine maintenance and repair may be performed to allow the continuation of
nonconforming structures.
B. The nonconforming situation of a nonconforming structure may not be enlarged or
altered in a way which increases the nonconformity; however, enlargements or
alterations to those areas where the structure is conforming may be permitted.
C. If a nonconforming structure is damaged to an extent greater than 50 percent of its
assessed value, it may be rebuilt only after the issuance of a Zoning Permit from the
Administrator. A Zoning Permit for reconstruction of such structure shall be secured
no later than 180 days from the date of destruction. In the issuance of the permit, the
following standards shall apply:
1. The structure shall be rebuilt to meet all of the provisions of this Ordinance if it
can be met.
2. If the structure cannot be rebuilt to meet all of the provisions of this Ordinance,
it shall not be rebuilt in a manner which increases its nonconformity.

D. If a nonconforming structure is moved on a lot upon which it is located, it shall, if
possible, be moved so as to make the structure conforming. Otherwise, the moved
structure shall be placed on the lot as conforming as possible.
E. A nonconforming manufactured home used as a principal residential structure may
only be replaced in accordance with the design criteria found in Chapter 5 of this
Ordinance.
F. A manufactured home may continue to be placed or replaced within a non-conforming
manufactured home subdivision on previously platted lots or previously approved
spaces, as well as make any necessary improvements to the subdivision infrastructure,
but shall not be permitted to expand the area or number of units contained within the
boundary of the subdivision.
G. Normal structural repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the continuation
of a nonconforming use. Also, a nonconforming use may be re-established in case of
damage to the structure in which it is located (to an extent of less than 50 percent of its
assessed value) due to fire or other disaster event pursuant to the issuance of a permit
by the Administrator. This shall include, as well, the repair or reconstruction of any
structure or on-site utility, parking or street infrastructure in support of said
nonconforming use. If said structure was also nonconforming, the reconstruction shall
meet the requirements of the applicable District. An application shall be filed for such
building permit no later than 60 days after the structure has been destroyed or
damaged, otherwise the use will not be allowed to be rebuilt. The building permit shall
expire six months after it is issued unless prior thereto a substantial beginning of the
reconstruction shall have occurred and thereafter diligently pursued.
H. If a nonconforming structure is destroyed to an extent of more than 50 percent of its
assessed value at the time of destruction, a use may only be allowed to re-establish in
accordance with the Ordinance in effect in the area in which it is located. Assessed
value shall be determined by using tax assessment records provided by the tax
assessors office for the year in which the structure was destroyed.
I. For the purpose of determining dimensional standards for nonconforming building
types and their lots, the following dimensional standards shall apply to all
nonconforming building types: (all standards are minimum unless otherwise noted)

13.5 Nonconforming Accessory Uses and Structures
A. A nonconforming accessory use or accessory structure may be expanded only if the
expansion does not increase the non-conforming condition of the structure.
B. No nonconforming accessory use or accessory structure shall continue after the
principal use or structure is terminated by abandonment, damage, or destruction unless
such accessory use or structure is made to conform to the standards for the zoning
district in which it is located. No non-conforming accessory use or structure shall
become or replace any terminated principal non-conforming use or structure.
13.6 Nonconforming Lots
A. Except as provided in 13.6.B & 13.6.C of this Chapter, a nonconforming vacant lot
may be developed for any of the uses permitted by these regulations in the District in
which it is located, provided that the use meets all applicable yard and setback
requirements for the District in which the lot is located.
B. A nonconforming vacant lot shall not be developed if it can be combined with an
adjoining lot (owned by the same person) on or after the effective date of these
regulations in order to create a single lot. If the combination results in the creation of a
single lot that is more than 1 ½ times the minimum lot width or area required in the
District, then the single lot may be divided into two lots of equal width and area
without being further classified as nonconforming. For the purposes of this section,
adjoining shall be deemed to mean the sharing of one or more common lot lines and
access to both lots can be provided by the same street without crossing that street.
C. A nonconforming lot may be developed if, at the effective date of this Ordinance the
lot is nonconforming, the lot is located in (i) a subdivision in which the lot was located
had received preliminary plat approval; or (ii) a subdivision in which the lot was located
had received final plat approval.
13.7 Nonconforming Signs
A. Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs, including but not limited to
repainting and electrical repairs are permitted. However, relocation or structural
changes to size, shape, or height of the sign are prohibited except to make the sign
more conforming to the provisions of this Ordinance.
B. The interchangeable sign face of a nonconforming freestanding or building cabinet sign
may be replaced; however, this permission does not extend to include relocation or
structural changes to size, shape, or height.
C. A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced if the sign is damaged by more than fifty
(50%) percent of its value as listed in the Rowan County assessor's office on the annual
tax listing. If the value of the sign is not listed, the value shall be determined by the
Administrator as the depreciated replacement value of the sign.

approve such plan. A property owner shall be notified in writing of additional required
approvals or modifications which may be necessary in order for the plan to conform to
the Ordinance.
C. Any amendment or modification to an approved site specific plan, which would have
required approval pursuant to the Ordinance, the rule or regulation by which the plan
was originally approved, shall be reviewed and considered in accordance with the terms
and provisions of this Ordinance as if it were an amendment or modification to a plan
originally approved under this Ordinance.
D. This section does not prohibit the exercise of any vested right established by common
law Ordinance or statue.

G. Modification of Dimensional Standards
1. The Administrator is authorized to approve requests that deviate from required
setbacks set forth in this Ordinance by up to ten (10%) percent of the required
setbacks or 24 inches, whichever is greater, upon determination that one or more
of the following conditions exists:
a. There are site or structural conditions that preclude strict adherence to the
setback requirements, such as, but not limited to: the lot does not meet
the dimensional standards established for the zoning district in which it is
located; the lot has topographic limitations that require placement of the
structure into the required setback area; or the structure is physically in
line with an existing, legally established wall or walls of a principal
structure already within the minimum setback area.

15.7 Certificate of Appropriateness
A. Applicability
? Buildings and Structures in Locally Designated Historic Districts
? Locally Designated Historic Landmarks
? Demolition of a Designated Landmark
B. Certificate of Appropriateness Required
1. No exterior portion of any building or other structure (including masonry, walls,
fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant features) nor
above-ground utility structure nor any type of outdoor advertising sign nor any
tree larger than 18 inches in diameter at 4½ feet above the ground shall be
erected, altered, restored, moved or demolished on a landmark, or within the
historic district until after an application for a certificate of appropriateness as to
exterior features has been submitted to and approved by the Historic
Preservation Commission. However, in the case where a tree may be diseased or
severely damaged, it can be removed and shall be replaced with a similar type
plant material contained on the plant list of the Design Guidelines with a minor
works approval. In addition, nothing in this section would prevent the removal
of a tree that is an immediate danger to life or property.
Exterior features shall include the architectural style, general design and general
arrangement of the exterior of a building or other structure, including the color,
the kind and texture of the building material, the size and scale of the building
and the type and style of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs and other
appurtenant fixtures. In the case of outdoor advertising signs, exterior features
shall be construed to mean the style, material, size and location of all such signs.
2. Such a certificate shall be issued by the commission prior to the issuance of a
zoning permit or other permit granted for purposes of constructing, altering,
moving or demolishing structures. A certificate of appropriateness shall be
required whether or not a zoning permit is required. Therefore, a certificate of
appropriateness is a prerequisite to the issuance of such a zoning permit or such
other permits. Any such zoning permits or such other permits not issued in
conformity with this section shall be invalid.
3. The State of North Carolina, the City of Salisbury and all public utility
companies shall be required to obtain a certificate of appropriateness for
landmarks and in the historic district prior to initiating any changes in the
character of street paving, sidewalks, utility installations, lighting, walls, fences,
structures and buildings on property, easements or streets owned or franchised
by the State of North Carolina, the City of Salisbury or public utility companies.
C. Criteria to determine appropriateness: The following review criteria, along with
companion design guidelines and the guidelines of the secretary of the interior, shall be
considered, where relevant, to make findings of fact indicating the extent to which the
application for a certificate of appropriateness is or is not congruous with the historic
aspects of the designated landmark or district:

period of up to three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date of approval.
The maximum period of delay authorized by this section shall be reduced by the
commission where it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be
permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from such property by
virtue of the delay. During such period the commission shall negotiate with the
owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the
building or site.

a. The commission finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or
be permanently deprived of all beneficial use or return by virtue of the
denial; or
b. The city has adopted a demolition ordinance under the minimum housing
code.
3. If the commission has voted to recommend designation of a property as a
landmark or designation of an area as a district, and final designation has not
been made by the City Council, the demolition or destruction of any building,
site or structure located on the property of the proposed landmark or in the
proposed district may be delayed by the commission for a period of up to one
hundred eighty (180) days or until the City Council takes final action on the
designation, whichever comes first.
F. Authentic Restorations
1. In the event that the commission, in considering an application for a certificate
of appropriateness, shall find that a building or structure for which a zoning
permit is requested is to be an authentic restoration or reconstruction of a
building or structure which existed at the same location but does not meet
zoning requirements, said building or structure may be authorized to be restored
or reconstructed at the same location where the original building or structure
was located, provided the Board of Adjustment authorizes such as a special
exception and no use other than that permitted in the district in which such is
located is made of said property. Such conditions as may be attached to the
Historic Preservation Commission approval and those conditions as may be set
by the Board of Adjustment shall be included in any certificate of
appropriateness related thereto.
2. If the commission finds that an application for a certificate of appropriateness
concerning any porches, steps, posts, fences, walls or other items extending over,
on or within public rights-of-way to be necessary for the authentic restoration,
reconstruction or maintenance thereof, and will not impede or block pedestrian
traffic or constitute a hazard to public safety, such findings shall be transmitted
to City Council for its consideration in authorizing or denying such
encroachments into rights-of-way.
3. If the Council authorizes such encroachment, any items restored, reconstructed
or maintained on, over or within a public right-of-way shall be the responsibility
of the owner, and the owner shall agree to protect and hold the City of Salisbury
blameless against any and all liability, cost damage or expense suffered as a result
of the restoration, reconstruction or maintenance thereof. The lowest point of
any such item projecting over any sidewalk shall be at least nine (9) feet above
the sidewalk immediately below.

G. Minor Works: A Certificate of Appropriateness application, when determined to
involve a minor work, may be reviewed and approved by the Administrator (Staff
Approval) or the Minor Works Committee. The Minor Works committee consists of
the Historic Preservation Commission Chairman and Vice-chairman and the
Administrator. Minor works are defined as those exterior changes that do not involve
substantial alterations, additions or removals that could impair the integrity of the
landmark or property in the historic district.
An application may receive a certificate of appropriateness from the committee if it falls
under the list of minor works provided in the Historic Preservation Commission Rules
of Procedure. If the committee does not issue a Certificate of Appropriateness, the
applicant will be advised to make a formal application to the Historic Preservation
Commission. No application may be denied without formal action by the Historic
Preservation Commission.
H. Effect of Certification of Appropriateness Approval: Passage of a motion to
approve, with or without modification, an application shall constitute the issuance of a
Certificate of Appropriateness by the Historic Preservation Commission. The
application and the duly approved minutes of the commission shall constitute the
written documentation of such issuances. Following the meeting a Certificate shall be
mailed to the property for which a certificate has been issued. The Certificate shall be
posted on the premises, in a location visible from the street, while the work is in
progress. Minutes of a Historic Preservation Commission meeting shall be approved
before the end of the next meeting.
I. Expiration of Certificate: A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be valid for a period
of six (6) months from the date of issuance for the purpose of obtaining a Zoning
Permit or other permit for constructing or altering structures. A Certificate of
Appropriateness shall expire six (6) months after the date of issuance if the work
authorized by the certificate has not been commenced. If after commencement the
work is discontinued for a period of six (6) months, the permit therefore shall
immediately expire.

15.10 Subdivision Procedures - General Provisions
A. Case Management: The Administrator, or their designee, shall assign a case number
to all subdivision plats for processing and permanent tracking. Following original
approval of the case, any and all changes to the plat shall be considered modifications
to the original plat and shall be processed under the original case number. Any
approved modifications shall fully replace the original approval. Concurrently-approved
plats for the same property or properties are prohibited.
B. Approval to Proceed with Construction Activity: Grading, soil erosion control, and
infrastructure construction activities shall not commence before a Final Plat has been
properly approved and recorded for a Minor Subdivision or Construction Document
approval for Major Subdivisions as prescribed by this Chapter.
C. Preliminary Plat:
1. Approval Duration: The approval of the Preliminary Plat shall become null and
void within three (3) years, unless the developer has completed required
improvements (or posted the appropriate guarantee of improvements) and
submitted for approval the final plat as required by this ordinance or shall have
applied for and received an extension of time from the Administrator. The
Technical Review Committee may, at its discretion, require a Preliminary Plat to
adhere to any new requirements before granting this extension. If a Preliminary
Plat becomes null and void, the subdivider may resubmit for an updated
approval; however, the resubmitted Preliminary Plat may be subject to any new
requirements for Preliminary Plats in effect at the time re-approval is sought, and
fees shall be paid at fifty percent (50%) of current standard fees.
2. Multiple Phases Not Approved: Approval of a Preliminary Plat constituting an
individual phase of a multi-phase project, which has not been entirely approved,
does not constitute approval by the City of any remaining phases. For approved
Preliminary Plats consisting of multiple phases, only the phase that is to be
developed for sale immediately (or have been guaranteed in accordance with
15.10.C.2 below) shall be submitted for Final Plat approval.
D. Final Plats:
1. Improvements Required: The Final Plat shall constitute a complete phase of
the approved Construction Documents. No Final Plat shall be approved unless
and until the developer has installed in that area all improvements required by
this Ordinance or has posted any required improvement guarantees approved by
the Administrator and prescribed by this Ordinance in Section 4.5, Installation
of Improvements.
2. Plats to be Recorded: Approved Final Plats shall be filed by the applicant for
recording with the Register of Deeds of Rowan County within thirty (30) days of
the date of approval by the Administrator; otherwise, such approval shall be null
and void.

15.12 Minor Subdivision
A. Applicability:
A Minor Subdivision is a subdivision of land:
? Involving not more than four (4) lots fronting on an existing approved street; and
? Not involving any new street or prospectively requiring any new street for access to
interior property; and
? Not requiring extension of public sewage or water lines to serve properties at the
rear; and
? Creating no new or residual parcels not conforming to the requirements of these
regulations and related ordinances; and
? Not being located partially or entirely within a WS-IV-PA (Watershed) Zoning
overlay
The draft plat shall show the location of the nearest public water and sewer systems.
Within the city limits, if any portion of the original tract lies within two hundred (200)
feet of a public sewer main, or within three hundred (300) feet of a public water line, all
newly created lots shall have direct access to the respective public utility. If a utility
extension is necessary to meet this requirement, the development will not qualify as a
minor plat subdivision.
The abbreviated procedure may not be used a second time within three (3) years on any
property less than fifteen hundred (1,500) feet from the original property boundaries by
anyone who owned, had an option, or any legal interest in the original property at the
time the minor subdivision received final plat approval.

15.14 Quasi-Judicial Proceedings  General Provisions
A. Purpose: This section provides for the discretionary evaluation of certain applications
by requiring that certain decisions follow quasi-judicial proceedings, which are public
evidentiary hearings. These evidentiary hearings include testimony provided under oath
and the findings of fact supported by competent, substantial, and material evidence.
Specifically, these quasi-judicial procedures are applied to Administrative Appeals,
Variances, Alternate Methods of Compliance, and Special Use Permits.
B. Judicial Appeals:
1. Every quasi-judicial decision of the Board of Adjustment or the City Council
shall be subject to review by the Superior Court Division of the General Courts
of Justice of the State of North Carolina by proceedings in the nature of
certiorari. Any petition for review by the Superior Court shall be duly verified
and filed with the Clerk of Superior Court within thirty (30) days after a decision
is filed in the office of the City Clerk, or after a written copy is delivered to every
aggrieved party who has filed a written request for such copy with the
Administrator at the time of the hearing of the case, whichever is later.
2. Every quasi-judicial decision of the Alternate Methods of Design Commission
shall be appealed to the Board of Adjustment within thirty (30) days of the
decision. Appeals shall be submitted in writing to the Development Services
division for scheduling and processing.
C. Quasi-Judicial Procedures:
1. Witnesses: Any person intending to present testimony shall be treated as a
witness. The Administrator and any staff member shall be treated as a witness
when 1) defending an interpretation of this Ordinance, 2) stating what is
perceived to be facts of a case, or 3) making a recommendation concerning the
outcome of a case. All witnesses shall be sworn by the Mayor or board
/commission chair before the opening of the evidentiary hearing.
2. Evidentiary Hearing: An evidentiary hearing shall be held on each quasijudicial
case. The Mayor or board /commission chair shall make it clear when
the evidentiary hearing is opened and closed; however, the hearing may be
continued to another meeting if the motion to continue specifies when and
where the continued hearing will be held. Once the evidentiary hearing is closed,
the vote may occur at the same meeting or carried over to future duly-noticed
meeting.
3. Deliberation: Following closure of the evidentiary hearing, the City Council,
Board of Adjustment, or Alternate Methods of Design Commission must
deliberate on the evidence provided during testimony and the ordinance
standards applicable to the case in order to make conclusions of law explaining
the logic behind the impending decision. The findings of fact must be designed
to summarize all evidence, allowing conclusions of law to be made about how
the ordinance standards apply to the case.

2/6/2018; ORD.2018-09; 10/2/2018, ORD.2018-49
4. Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law: Following adjudication of the case,
the findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be stated at the meeting. The
Administrator, or their designee, shall prepare the findings of fact and
conclusions of law for review and approval at the next meeting.
5. Voting: All quasi-judicial decisions of the Board of Adjustment require a
concurrent supermajority 4/5 vote of the entire board. For the purposes of
calculating this supermajority, membership of the entire board shall not
include vacant positions and those disqualified from voting. All quasi-judicial
decisions of the City Council or Alternate Methods of Design Commission
require a simple majority vote.
6. Rehearing: An application for a rehearing shall be made in the same manner as
provided for an original hearing within a period of fifteen (15) days after the date
of adjudication. In addition, specific information to enable the City Council,
Board of Adjustment, or Alternate Methods of Design Commission to
determine whether or not there has been a substantial change in facts, evidence,
or conditions in the case, shall be presented in writing or graphically. A rehearing
shall be denied by the City Council, Board of Adjustment, or Alternate Methods
of Design Commission, if, in its judgment, such change in facts, evidence or
conditions has not been proven. An evidentiary hearing shall not be required to
be held to consider holding such a rehearing.
15.15 Administrative Appeals
A. Applicability: The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from and review
any order, requirement, decision, interpretation, or citation made by the Administrator,
the Technical Review Commission, or the Historic Preservation Commission and apply
such interpretation to particular fact situations.
B. Applicant with Standing: An appeal may be made by any aggrieved party or by any
officer, department or board of Salisbury who has received a ruling from the
Administrator, the Technical Review Commission, or the Historic Preservation
Commission upon the submission of a completed application. An appeal to the Board
of Adjustment shall be made within thirty (30) days of the decision, order,
determination, or interpretation made by the Administrator. A properly-filed appeal
shall be placed on the Board of Adjustment agenda within 30 days of filing. The filing
of any application stays all proceedings unless the Administrator certifies that a stay in
his opinion will cause imminent peril to life or property, or, that because the violation
charged is transitory in nature a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the
Ordinance. In that event, proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order,
which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a judicial court of law.
C. Board Powers and Responsibilities: The Board of Adjustment may, after having
held a public hearing on the matter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify
the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed. The Board of Adjustment
shall have all the powers of the Administrator in making any order, requirement,
decision, interpretation or determination with reference to an appeal or petition.

determination of the Administrator. All decisions of the Board of Adjustment shall be
in writing and filed with the Administrator.
15.16 Variances
A. Applicability: When practical difficulties, special conditions, or unnecessary hardships
would result from carrying out the strict letter of this Ordinance, the Board of
Adjustment shall have the power to vary or modify any of the regulations or provisions
of this Ordinance.
B. Applicant with Standing: A petition for a variance may be initiated only by the owner
of the affected property, an agent authorized in writing to act on the owner's behalf, or
a person having a written contractual interest in the affected property upon the
submission of a completed application. The filing of any application stays all
proceedings unless the Administrator certifies that a stay in his opinion will cause
imminent peril to life or property, or, that because the violation charged is transitory in
nature a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the Ordinance. In that
event, proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be
granted by the Board of Adjustment, City Council or by a judicial court of law.
C. Required Findings & Conclusions of Law: The Board of Adjustment may only
grant a variance having first held a public hearing on the matter and having made the
following determinations:
1. There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying
out the strict letter of the Ordinance; and
2. That the variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this
Ordinance and preserves its spirit; and
3. That in the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare have been
assured and substantial justice has been done; and
4. That the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of a variance,
and that the variance is a minimum one that will make possible the reasonable
use of land or structures.
5. That if the applicant complies with the provisions of this Ordinance, can secure
no reasonable return from, nor make any reasonable use of the property.
The following are not cause for a variance:
? The citing of other nonconforming or conforming uses of land or structures in the
same or other districts.
? The request for a particular use expressly, or by inference, prohibited in the district
involved.
? Economic hardship or the fact that property may be utilized more profitably with a
variance.

D. Board May Apply Conditions to Motion: The Board of Adjustment, in granting a
variance, may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this
Ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which a variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance and
shall be punishable as prescribed in Chapter 19.
E. Supermajority Required for Decision: The concurrent supermajority vote shall be
necessary to grant a variance. All decisions of the Board of Adjustment shall be in
writing and filed with the Administrator.
F. Time for Decision: Except for modification of dimensional standards as noted in
Section 15.4.G.1, the Board of Adjustment shall hold a public hearing on an application
no later than 60 days after a complete application has been filed with the Administrator.
The Board of Adjustment shall decide on the matter, which was presented at the public
hearing within 31 days of the close of the public hearing.
G. Effect of Denial-Time to Resubmit: Upon the denial of an original application, or
upon the denial of an application from which a rehearing has been conducted, a similar
application may not be filed for a period of one year after the date of denial of the
original application.
15.17 Alternate Methods of Compliance
A. Purpose: Alternate methods of compliance is a method by which the Alternate
Methods of Design Commission (AMDC) may approve alternative materials or
alternative methods to specific design-related provisions throughout this Ordinance.
Several of the following provisions are also eligible for exemption through the
Conditional District (CD) process. When processing a CD petition, the AMDC
operates as a legislative advisory body and may recommend alternate methods of
compliance to the Planning Board. The specific provisions eligible for alternate
methods of compliance are as follows:
1. Sec. 2.4.D.1: Building Design Standards for Light & Heavy Industrial
development
2. Sec 5.6.A: Building Placement and Orientation, except that Campus-Style
Development requires consideration through the Conditional District process.
3. Sec. 5.7.A-B: Residential Cladding and Construction Methods
4. Sec. 5.8.D, 5.9.C, 5.10.B, 5.12.B, 5.13.B: Design Element Provisions for
House, Townhouse, Apartment, Mixed-Use, and Commercial types

7. Sec. 11.4: Non-Residential Lighting Design Provisions
8. Ch. 12, Signs: Those provisions expressly noted in the Sign Ordinance
Alternate methods of compliance may not be suitable for all scenarios of development.
The purpose of the alternate methods of compliance is to allow variation in design
consideration due to physical building or site constraints, innovative design and/or
development technologies, and the inability of this Ordinance to consider every
possible building or landscape material available to the market that is in agreement with
the citys adopted land-use policies and will produce an equal level of results as
intended by this Ordinance.
B. Application: An application for AMDC consideration shall include the following:
1. Completed application, and
2. Copy of proposed Schematic or Master Plan, and
3. Copy of proposed Building Design Plans
C. General Findings Criteria: Findings, or conclusions of law, based on the following
criteria, must be based in fact and shall support the decision to approve or deny the
alternate method of compliance. The commission shall have the authority to suggest a
different alternative than requested; however, suggested changes must be approved by
the applicant. In addition to any specific standards associated with the particular designrelated
provision, the following general standards shall be considered when deliberating
and considering the findings of fact and conclusions of law prior to voting:
1. Equal or Superior Means: The alternate method of compliance alone enhances
the building or site by exceeding the minimum standard set by the Ordinance
provision, or the alternate method of compliance used in conjunction with a
superior design element meets the intent of the applicable Ordinance provision.
2. Design Characteristics: Physical design characteristics unique to the proposed
or existing building or site make strict compliance with the applicable Ordinance
provision(s) impractical or unreasonable.
3. Redevelopment or Additions to Existing Development: The alternate
method of compliance considers the site and/or building design of the existing
development and strives to preserve or enhance those existing design
characteristics that meet or exceed the applicable Ordinance provision.

15.18 Special Use Permits
A. Purpose: Special uses are land uses that are generally compatible with the land uses
permitted by right in a zoning district, but which require individual review of their
location, design, and configuration so as to evaluate the potential for adverse impacts
on adjacent property and uses. Special uses ensure the appropriateness of the use at a
particular location within a given zoning district.
B. General Requirements:
1. Only those uses enumerated as Special Uses in a zoning district shall be
authorized by the City Council.
2. The evaluation and approval of the Special Use Permit shall be governed by
quasi-judicial proceedings, which are based upon the sworn testimony and
evidence presented at the hearing relevant to the following standards:
a. The use meets all required principles and specifications of the Ordinance
and any adopted land use plans and is in harmony with the general
purpose and intent and preserves its spirit; and
b. The proposed plan as submitted and approved will be visually and
functionally compatible to the surrounding area; and
c. The public health, safety, and welfare will be assured and the proposed
development will not substantially injure the value of adjoining property
and associated uses if located where proposed.
3. In approving an application for a Special Use Permit, the City Council may
attach fair, reasonable, and appropriate conditions on the location, nature, and
extent of the proposed use. The City Council may not require the landowner to
waive a vested right as a condition of the Special Use Permit approval. The
burden of proof of producing evidence to support these Findings and to
overcome any challenges that approval of the plan would be contrary to one or
more of these Findings shall rest entirely with the applicant or landowner. The
applicant shall have up to thirty (30) calendar days to consider and respond to
any additional requirements prior to approval or denial by the City Council.
4. The applicant shall secure a valid building permit within a twelve (12) month
period from date of approval of the Special Use Permit unless otherwise
specified.
C. Effect of Approval: If an application is approved, the Special Use Permit that is
established and all conditions, which may have been attached to the approval, are
binding on the property. All subsequent development and use of the property shall be
in accordance with the approved plan and conditions. The applicant shall record the
approved Special Use Permit and submit a copy to the City. The authorization of
Council for a Special Use Permit and all supporting documentation shall become a part
of the certificate of occupancy.

D. Substantial Changes: Any substantial change to a Special Use Permit that results in
the increase of the intensity, density, or character of the use shall be approved or denied
by the City Council as an amended Special Use Permit. Minor field alterations or minor
revisions to approved Special Use Permits may be approved by the Administrator if the
Special Use still meets the intent of the standards established with the original approval.
E. Appeal: The determination of the Salisbury City Council shall be conclusive and final
and there shall be no further appeal to the Board of Adjustment or any other
administrative board or commission except the State Superior Court. A request for a
review may be made in the same manner as an original request. Evidence in support of
the request shall initially be limited to that which is necessary to enable council to
determine whether there has been a substantial change in the facts, evidence, or
conditions in the case. It shall thereupon treat the request in the same manner as the
original request. Otherwise, the Council may terminate any further consideration of
such request. The City Council may, however, review its authorization and the
conditions thereof and after such review may modify or change the conditions of the
Special Use Permit or may terminate the Special Use Permit only upon agreement with
one or more of the criterion set forth in 15.17.G.3, below. Any appeal for
administrative review concerning the enforcement of a Special Use Permit shall be to
the Salisbury City Council.
F. Rescission of Special Use Permits:
1. If such project is not complete and a valid building permit is not in place at the
end of the twelve (12) month period, the Administrator shall notify the applicant
of either such finding. Within thirty (30) days of said notification, the
Administrator shall make a recommendation concerning the rescission of the
Special Use Permit to the City Council. The City Council may then rescind the
special use, or extend the special use district for a specified period of time.
2. Other criteria for which a Special Use Permit may be rescinded or terminated
shall be as follows:
a. Non-compliance with adopted conditions.
b. Expressed diminution of value of surrounding properties that may only be
found during the evidentiary hearing and made a part of the Findings of
Fact.
c. Expressed negative effects related to the general safety, health, and
welfare of the surrounding community, which may only be found during
the evidentiary hearing and made a part of the Findings of Fact.
d. Recorded and repeated Code violations.
e. Any non-conformity created by amortization of the permitted use, which
would only be established as a condition of the permit.
f. Any zoning map amendment to a zoning district that would create a nonconformity
between the district and associated permit.

15.19 Special Sign Permits: See Section 12.16 of the Sign Ordinance
15.20 Legislative Procedures  General Provisions
A. Purpose: The purpose of this Section is to establish uniform procedures for processing
matters requiring a legislative approval process. Specifically, these legislative procedures
are applied to Text Amendments, Map Amendments (rezonings), Conditional Districts,
and Vested Rights.
B. Amendments and Regulations pertaining to a Watershed District: Under no
circumstances shall the City Council adopt any amendment, addition, or deletion that
would cause these regulations to violate the watershed protection rules as adopted by
the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission. Any amendment to the
boundaries of a Water Supply Watershed District or to the text of this Ordinance
related to Watershed Protection shall be referred to the North Carolina Division of
Water Quality for their review prior to adoption.
C. Required Compliance with Adopted Plans: Zoning regulations and amendments
shall be made in accordance with the comprehensive plan and any other applicable
officially-adopted plans. Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the City
Council shall adopt a statement describing whether its action is consistent with an
adopted plan and explaining why the Council considers the action taken to be
reasonable and in the public interest. That statement is not subject to judicial review.
The Planning Board shall advise and comment on whether the proposed amendment is
consistent with the comprehensive plan and any other applicable officially-adopted
plans. The Planning Board shall provide a written recommendation to the governing
board that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate by the
Planning Board, but a comment by the Planning Board that a proposed amendment is
inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not preclude consideration or approval
of the proposed amendment by the City Council.
D. Protest Petitions Repealed via N.C.S.L. 2015-160 (effective 1 August 2015)
1. In case of protest against any Land Management and Development Map (zoning
map) amendment (rezoning), duly signed by the owners of 5% of the land
included within a 100-foot wide buffer around each separate area proposed to be
rezoned, such amendment shall not become effective except by a favorable vote
of three fourths (3/4) of all the members of the City Council members eligible to
vote on the matter (excluding vacancies and those who have a financial conflict
of interest and are prohibited by law from voting on the matter) rather than by
majority decision. Street rights-of-way are not considered for the 100-foot buffer
unless the right-of-way has a width greater than 100 feet. When less than an
entire parcel is proposed to be rezoned, the qualifying buffer is measured from
the property line rather than the zoning district boundary.
2. No protest against any proposed amendment shall be valid or effective unless it
is in the form of a written petition actually bearing the signatures of the required
number of property owners and stating that the signers do protest the proposed
change or amendment. All such petitions shall be filed in the office of the City

15.23 Conditional Districts
A. Purpose: The Conditional District (CD) is a floating overlay zoning district that
exempts specific Ordinance provisions so as to encourage innovative design. Although
not measured against all provisions of this Ordinance, the City will review CD
development in light of all applicable, adopted plans and policies in order to provide
greater certainty as to the resulting project.
The Conditional District is an alternative zoning process that may permit a mixture of
land uses and alternative development standards as may be required to address the
unique characteristics of an individual property through a Master Plan. The plan shall
be designed such that, at a minimum, the location, integration and arrangement of land
uses, buildings, structures, utilities, access, transit, parking, and streets collectively yield
a context sensitive development. The CD is not intended to relieve hardships that
would otherwise be handled using a variance procedure; rather, the CD is intended as a
means of accommodating design innovation and market expectations.
When designing a CD Master Plan, the following chapter and/or section provisions are
not applicable. The Master Plan may identify any alternatives to those provisions but
when a plan is not providing an alternative, the following provisions shall remain
applicable.
1. Sections 2.4.D: District Provisions
2. Sections 5.5 through 5.17 of Building Types and Standards
3. Sections 4.8, 4.10: Subdivisions and Infrastructure

1. Case Management: The Administrator, or their designee, shall assign a case
number to all Conditional Districts for processing and permanent tracking.
Following original approval of the case, any and all changes to the plan shall be
considered modifications to the original plan and shall be processed under the
original case number. Any approved modifications shall fully replace the original
approval. Concurrently-approved plans for the same property or properties are
prohibited.
2. Petitioner: A petition to adopt or amend a CD shall be submitted by the current
owner(s), or their duly-authorized representative(s), of all property to be
included. An application to revise an existing CD Master Plan shall also be
submitted by the current owner(s) of all property, or their duly-authorized
representative(s), included in the adopted Conditional District overlay. A CD
shall consist of land under unified control which may be planned and developed
as a single development or as an approved programmed series of development
phases by multiple developers. "Unified control" means that all land to be
included within a CD shall be owned or otherwise under the legal control of the
person or legal entity which has petitioned for a Conditional District. Such
person or entity shall be legally capable of providing a commitment to the city
that the CD development will comply with all documents, plans, standards and
conditions ultimately approved by the City.
3. Content of Petition:
a. A Conditional District shall consist of the CD Master Plan and any other
plans, drawings, renderings, elevations, maps and documents specifically
included as development documents for approval by the City Council.
The Master Plan, as a site specific conditional zoning plan, is itself a
condition of the Conditional District rezoning.
b. Master Plan: The development concept of all land areas encompassed by
a Conditional District shall be adequately described by a Master Plan
comprised of scaled drawings and associated reports in accordance with
the Development Plan Requirements of Section 16.4.
c. In addition to the Master Plan, the petitioner shall provide the exact land
uses proposed for the Conditional District. Such uses may be selected
from any of the uses, whether permitted by right or conditional, allowed
in the underlying base zoning district that is coupled with the Conditional
District petition. Uses not otherwise permitted within the underlying base
zoning district shall not be permitted within the Conditional District.
4. District Uses & Standards: Within an approved Conditional District, no use
shall be permitted except in accordance with the underlying base district, base
district provisions, and pursuant to the conditions imposed on the Conditional
District in the approval of the rezoning.
5. Fair and Reasonable Conditions: As permitted by Sec. 15.21.A.1-5 the
provisions of the approved CD Master Plan shall replace all conflicting
development regulations set forth in this Ordinance which would otherwise

apply to the development site. The Planning Board may recommend and the City
Council may attach reasonable and appropriate conditions including, but not
limited to, the location, nature, hours of operation, and extent of the proposed
use(s). Conditions and site-specific standards shall be limited to those that
address conformance of the development and use of the site to this Ordinance
and officially adopted plans and those standards and conditions that address the
impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development and use of the
site. The applicant will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to
any additional requirements proposed by either the Planning Board or the City
Council prior to final action.
6. Decisions: Decisions by the City Council shall be by simple majority vote,
unless a valid Protest Petition in accordance with Section 15.18.D has been filed,
in which case, a three-fourths (3/4) majority vote of eligible members shall be
required for approval.
C. Ability to Proceed: The applicant may proceed with development after adoption of
the Conditional District Master Plan and ordinance, all construction documents, and
recordation of any applicable plat with the Rowan County Register of Deeds. The
development and use of all land within the Conditional District shall be in keeping with
the approved Master Plan and all applicable provisions therein.
D. Final Approval by Stages: If so reflected on the Master Plan, the City Council may
allow the staging of development. Each phase of development shall adhere to all
applicable provisions and standards of this ordinance and the applicable CD Master
Plan.
E. Amendments: An amendment to a CD is a petition to rezone and newly adopt a CD
Master Plan and ordinance with any new conditions or site-specific standards, and
requires consideration by both Planning Board and City Council. The following eight
circumstances have the potential for significantly altering the basic development
concept or intent of the originally-approved plan and shall require an amendment:
1. Land area being added or removed from the Conditional District.
2. Modification of any conditions, site-specific standards, design standards, or
other requirements specified by the Conditional District ordinance.
3. A change in land use or development type beyond that permitted by the
Conditional District ordinance.
4. When there is introduction of a new vehicular access point to an existing street,
road or thoroughfare not previously designated for access.
5. When there is an increase in the total number of residential dwelling units
originally authorized by the Conditional District ordinance.
6. When the total floor area of a commercial or industrial classification is increased
more than ten percent (10%) beyond the total floor area originally authorized by
the Conditional District ordinance.

approval, if any change or variation is proposed to the CD Master Plan and
Conditional District ordinance.
8. When the Planning Board considers a revision significant and recommends City
Council consideration and approval.
F. Revisions: A revision to a CD is an application to revise an existing, approved CD
Master Plan, and requires consideration by the Planning Board or the Technical Review
Committee (TRC), depending on the application.
1. Planning Board Revisions: Revisions requiring Planning Board consideration
are those that do not alter the basic development concept as an amendment
does; instead, they are changes to the approval CD Master Plan that may alter
the project site due to final engineering or field conditions.
a. 10% Rule: Notwithstanding those changes that trigger an amendment,
changes to numbered items, including but not limited to landscaping
points, lighting fixtures, and parking spaces, by 10% or more shall receive
Planning Board consideration. However, the Planning Board liaison to the
TRC may keep a change at the TRC level if the 10% or more change
appears insignificant for Planning Board consideration.
b. Interconnectivity: Changes that propose to remove or add a point of
interconnectivity between private properties shall receive Planning Board
consideration.
2. Technical Review Committee Revisions: Revisions requiring TRC
consideration are those that insignificantly alter or rearrange the project site due
to final engineering or field conditions.
a. 10% Rule: Notwithstanding those changes that trigger an amendment or
revision to the Planning Board, changes to numbered items, including but
not limited to landscaping points, lighting fixtures, and parking spaces, by
less than 10% shall receive TRC consideration.
b. Arrangement: Rearrangement, with no net loss or gain, of any item on an
approved CD Master Plan shall receive TRC consideration.
c. When the TRC considers a revision significant enough for Planning
Board consideration, the TRC or the Planning Board liaison may send it
to the Planning Board for their consideration.
d. Appeals to TRC decisions on CD Master Plan revisions shall be heard by
the Planning Board through a quasi-judicial process
G. Rescission of Conditional District for Non-Development: The petitioner shall
secure a valid building or construction permit(s) within a 24-month period from date of
approval of the Conditional District unless otherwise specified. If a valid building or
construction permit is not in place at the end of the 24-month period, the

15.24 Vested Rights
A. General Procedures: Pursuant to G.S.160A-385.1 and not withstanding any other
provision or amendment, a landowner may apply for approval of a Site-Specific
Development Plan as defined in the statute that shall entitle said landowner to develop
property in accordance with the previously approved plan.
All requests for Vested Rights shall be accompanied by a copy of the approved
Site-Specific Development Plan (Master Plan), as defined by the NC General Statutes,
in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. A request to extend Vested Rights to
a previously approved Site-Specific Development Plan shall be reviewed and approved
by the City Council after notice and public hearing.
B. City Council Action: The City Council shall determine whether or not to grant or
establish a vested right. The City Council may not require the landowner to waive his
vested right as a condition of development approval. The City Council may approve the
vested rights for a period greater than two (2) years where it is found that due to (i) the
sizing and phasing of the development; or (ii) the level of investment; or (iii) the need
for the development; or (iv) economic cycles; or (v) market conditions, building permits
for all phases of the development cannot be secured within two years, provided the
total period does not exceed five (5) years from the date of plan approval of the site.
C. Effect of Approval of Vesting: The effect of the City Council approving a vested plan
shall be to vest such site plan for a period of two (2) years to five (5) years as approved
by the City Council from the date of approval.
A vested right shall confer upon the landowner the right to undertake and complete the
development and use of said property under the terms and conditions of the approved
site-specific development plan as provided for in this Section. Failure to abide by the
terms and conditions placed upon such approval will result in the forfeiture of the
previously granted or established vested right.
A vested right, once established shall preclude any zoning action by the City which
would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish or otherwise delay the development or
use of the property in accordance with the approved Site-Specific Development Plan
except under the following conditions where such rights are terminated and revoked:
1. The affected landowner provides written consent to the City of his desire to
terminate the vested right; or,
2. The City determines after having advertised and held a public hearing, that
natural or man-made hazards exist on or in the immediate vicinity of the
property which pose a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare if
the project were to proceed as indicated in the plan; or,
3. Compensation is made by the City to the landowner for all costs, expenses, and
other losses incurred including, but not limited to, all fees paid in consideration
of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and any other
consultant's fees incurred after approval together with interest thereon at the
legal rate until paid; or,

4. The City determines, after having advertised and held a public hearing, that the
landowner or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or
made material misrepresentations which made a difference in the approval by the
City Council of the plan; or,
5. Upon the enactment of a State or Federal law or regulations which precludes
development as shown in plan. In such case the City may, after having advertised
and conducted a public hearing, modify the affected provisions upon a finding
that this change in State or Federal law has a fundamental effect on the plan.
Once a vested right is granted to a particular plan, nothing in this section shall preclude
the City from conducting subsequent reviews and approvals to ensure compliance with
the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided such reviews and approvals
are consistent with the original approval.
The establishment of a vested right on a piece of property for a site-specific
development plan shall not preclude the City from establishing and enforcing on the
property any additional regulations (adopted during the time the vested right was in
effect) which are general in nature and applicable to all property subject to the
regulations of this Ordinance.
D. Establishment of Common Law Vesting Plans: Previously approved Site-Specific
Development Plans shall be reviewed for compliance and consistency and subsequently
approved by the Administrator or designee in accordance with the provisions of this
Chapter, providing the proposed Construction Documents for the Site Plan or
Subdivision do not deviate from, and is subdivided/developed in accordance with the
previously approved site specific plan. Substantial financial investment shall be
determined and a good faith effort made to develop proportionate to the approved
statutory vested plan.
E. Revocation or Expiration of a Vested Right: The vested right, resulting from the
approval of a site-specific development plan, may be revoked by the City Council if the
City Council determines that the landowner has failed to comply with the terms and
conditions of the approval or with any other applicable portion of this Ordinance. As
prescribed under the provisions of G.S.160A-385.1, the vested right shall otherwise
expire at the end of the approval period established by the City Council. A building
permit issued by the Rowan County Building Inspector pursuant to G.S. 160A-417 may
not expire or be revoked because of the running of time on a piece of property while a
plan has been approved and the vested right period has not otherwise expired.

Chapter 17. VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES
17.1 Complaints Regarding Violations
Whenever a violation of this Ordinance occurs, or is
alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written
complaint. Any written complaint stating fully the
cause and basis of the complaint shall be filed with
the Administrator who shall properly record such complaint, investigate in a timely manner,
and take appropriate action as provided by this Ordinance.
17.2 Penalties for Transferring Lots in Unapproved Subdivisions
Any property owner or owners agent of any land located within the jurisdiction of the City of
Salisbury, subdivides land in violation of this Ordinance or transfers or sells land by reference
to, exhibition of, or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land before the plat
has been properly approved under this Ordinance and recorded in the office of the register of
deeds, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in
the process of selling or transferring land shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty.
The City of Salisbury may bring an action for injunction of any illegal subdivision, transfer,
conveyance, or sale of land; and the court shall, upon appropriate findings, issue an injunction
and order requiring the offending party to comply with this Ordinance. In addition, the City
may refuse to issue any permits.
17.3 Penalties for Violation
Failure to comply with any provision of this Ordinance is hereby declared unlawful. The
following remedies and enforcement powers may be used to administer and enforce this
Ordinance.
A. Civil Penalty: In accordance with Section 8.5.1 of the General Code of Ordinances of
the City of Salisbury the Administrator may, in addition to other remedies found in this
Chapter, issue civil penalties.
1. Penalties for Violation: Any person determined to be in violation of any of the
provisions of this Ordinance shall receive a civil citation for a penalty of fifty
dollars ($50.00) for such violation. No penalty shall be assessed until the person
alleged to be in violation has been notified of the violation by a code
enforcement officer. Such notification shall be either through a personal visit or
by certified mail. If uncorrected after the notification, a code enforcement
officer who observed the violation shall issue a citation requiring the violator to
pay the above-stated penalty to the city revenue department. The owner, tenant,
or occupant of any building or land or part thereof or any person who
participates in or acts in concert, assists, directs, creates, or maintains any
condition found to be a violation shall be subject to the penalties and remedies
herein provided.

SALISBURY, NC LAND DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE
ADOPTED DECEMBER 18, 2007; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008
2. Uncorrected Violations:
a. When a code enforcement officer finds that a previous violation has not
been corrected, he shall issue another citation requiring payment of an
additional civil penalty in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
b. After a second citation has been issued, no further civil citation shall be
issued to the same person for the same continuing violation at the same
location unless and until an additional written notice is delivered to the
offender by personal service, registered mail or posting of the notice at the
location of the violation if reasonable attempts to serve the notice are
unsuccessful. The notice shall set forth the nature of the violation and
order that corrective action be taken. The notice shall state that failure to
correct the violation within the time specified in the notice will result in
the assessment of additional civil penalties and other enforcement action.
If after the specified time period has expired and corrective action has not
been completed, the civil penalty shall automatically activate in the amount
of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day and shall continue to be
accrued at the rate of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day until the
violation is corrected. The code enforcement officer shall notify the
violator by personal service or certified mail of the day of the civil penalty
began to accrue and shall state that the penalty will continue to accrue for
each day the violation remains uncorrected. Any enforcement action for
injunctive relief by the city shall not stay or abate the accruing of the civil
penalty, and the penalty shall continue to accrue daily until the violation is
finally corrected either voluntarily or by the city as a result of a court
order.
3. Failure to Pay: If the civil penalty is not paid within ten (10) days after demand
for payment by a code enforcement officer, the city may initiate a civil action in
the nature of a debt collection to recover civil penalties which have previously
accrued. Such action shall not stop further civil penalties from accruing if the
violation has not been corrected.
4. Civil Citations not Exclusive: Civil penalties are an additional remedy for code
enforcement. In addition thereto, all remedies allowed in North Carolina
General Statutes and this Ordinance may also be pursued by the city at the same
time without waiving the civil penalties authorized in this chapter.
5. Appeal of determination of violation: A person notified of a violation may
appeal such determination to the zoning board of adjustment. Such appeal shall
be filed with the city not later than ten (10) days after the receipt of the first
notice issued pursuant to section 17.3.A.1. Failure to file a timely appeal shall
constitute acceptance of the determination that a violation exists. If an appeal is
filed, further action by the code enforcement officer shall be suspended until a
ruling is issued by the board of adjustment. If the board finds that a violation
exists, enforcement under this chapter shall continue despite any further appeals
by the violator. The fact that an appeal is filed or pending under this chapter
shall not prevent the city from pursuing other enforcement remedies allowed by
law and a finding by the zoning board of adjustment that a violation does not

exist shall not be binding in any other enforcement proceeding brought by the
city against the same violation that the zoning board of adjustment ruled upon.
B. Criminal: Pursuant to North Carolina General Statute 14-4, any person, firm, or
corporation convicted of violating the provisions of this Ordinance shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined an amount consistent with
the General Statutes.
C. Equitable Remedy: The Administrator may apply to a judicial court of law for any
appropriate equitable remedy to enforce the provisions of this Ordinance. It is not a
defense to the Administrators application for equitable relief that there are other
remedies provided under general law or this Ordinance.
D. Injunction: Enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance may also be achieved by
injunction. When a violation occurs, the Administrator may, either before or after the
initiation of other authorized action, apply to the appropriate division of the court for a
mandatory or prohibitory injunction commanding the defendant to correct the
unlawful condition or cease the unlawful use of the property.
E. Order of Abatement: In addition to an injunction, the Administrator may apply for
and the court may enter into an order of abatement as part of the judgment in the case.
An order of abatement may direct any of the following actions:
1. Buildings or other structures on the property be closed, demolished, or
removed;
2. Fixtures, furniture or other moveable property be moved or removed entirely;
3. Improvements alterations, modifications or repairs be made; or
4. Any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into
compliance with this Ordinance.
F. Execution of Court Decisions: If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an
injunction or with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, the
defendant may be cited for contempt. The Administrator may execute the order of
abatement and will have a lien on the property in the nature of a mechanics and
materialmans lien for the cost of executing the order. The defendant may secure
cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and by
posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond must be given with sureties
approved by the Clerk of Superior Court in an amount approved by the judge before
whom the matter was heard and shall be conditioned for the defendants full
compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within the time fixed by the
judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement does not suspend or cancel an injunction
issued in conjunction with the order.

been officially adopted by the City Council as
a written document of city construction
standards.
Use, Special: A use permitted only upon
approval of the Salisbury Zoning Board of
adjustment. Such a use shall be permitted only
in the district in which it is listed and shall not
be accumulative to any other district. If
property exists such that an existing use which
was previously allowed by right would be
allowed only as a conditional use, that use
shall become nonconforming unless and until
a conditional use permit is issued.
Use, permitted: A use permitted in a given
district as a permitted use and so authorized
by being listed, or referenced as a permitted
use, by district, in article VIII, Use
Requirements by District.

including single-family dwelling, two-family
dwelling, multifamily dwelling, rooming or
boarding house, accessory buildings and
structures thereof and customary home
occupations.
Variance: A permission to develop or use
property granted by the Watershed Review
Board relaxing or waiving a water supply
watershed management requirement adopted
by the Environmental Management
Commission that is incorporated into this
Ordinance.
Vested rights: The right to undertake and
complete the development and use of
property under the terms and conditions of an
approved site specific development plan or an
approved phased development plan.
Watershed: The entire land area contributing
surface drainage to a specific point (e.g. the
water supply intake.)
Wetlands: Those areas that are inundated or
saturated by surface or ground water at a
frequency and duration sufficient to support,
under normal conditions, a prevalence of
vegetation typically adapted for life in
saturated soil conditions.
Yard: A space on the same lot with a
principal building open, unoccupied and
unobstructed by buildings or structures from
ground to sky except where encroachments
and accessory buildings are expressly
permitted.
Yard, front: An open, unoccupied space on
the same lot with a principal building,
extended the full width of the lot, and situated

extending from the rear line of the front yard
to the front line of the rear yard.
Zero lot line: A development approach in
which a building is sited on one or more lot
lines with no yard. Conceivably, three of the
four sides of the building could be on the lot
lines. The intent is to allow more flexibility in
site design and to increase the amount of
usable open space on the lot. Virtually all
zoning Ordinances retain yard requirements;
where zero lot line developments have been
permitted, they have been handled through
group development procedures, or other
devised which allow for site plan review. The
few Ordinances which specifically authorize
the zero lot line approach do so as an
exception to prevailing regulations and under
clearly defined circumstances.
Zoning: A police power measure, enacted
primarily by general purpose units of local
government, in which the community is

15.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT
The East Innes Street Gateway Plan is established to provide development and design
standards for particular street corridors, which are in addition to underlying general and
special use districts. Where noted, the standards of the Gateway Plan supersede those
standards of the underlying districts.
The purpose for the Gateway Plan is to enhance the economic, functional, and aesthetic
importance of significant street corridors in:
¦ encouraging the development of vacant and underutilized parcels and the
redevelopment of vacant or declining parcels (also known as greyfield
redevelopment) to provide additional tax base while maximizing the use of existing
public infrastructure;
¦ contributing to the physical, social and economic well-being of the city through the
provision of services and commerce -- thereby enhancing the general welfare of the
citizens of the City of Salisbury;
¦ reducing congestion by encouraging greater pedestrian travel in the corridor through
the provision of safe and interesting pedestrian routes;
¦ providing for the safe and efficient movement of vehicles;
¦ defining the citys architectural, environmental and visual character; and
¦ applying design standards to ensure a minimum level of quality befitting of the City
of Salisbury while incentivizing compliance through reduced setback and parking
requirements;

AIRPORT ZONING OVERLAY
Airport Zone Overlay (AZO). The zones and restrictions established in this subsection are designed to
limit the height of structures surrounding the county airports established elevation of 771 above mean sea
level (msl) in order to prevent hazards to the lives and property of the users of the airport and the occupants
of land in the vicinity.
A. Uses allowed. The use requirements of the underlying district apply to the AZO district. However,
all uses must be in conformance with the provisions of this section.
B. Establishment of zones. To carry out the provisions of this section, there are hereby created and
established certain civil airport imaginary surfaces which include all of the land lying beneath the
approach surface, transitional surface, horizontal surface, conical surface and primary surface. These
civil airport imaginary surfaces are established with relation to the Rowan County Airport runway
and proposed extensions of thereof. Such imaginary surfaces are shown on the Official County
Airport Zoning Map prepared by the Rowan County Planning Department and dated October 4,
2004, which is adopted and incorporated herein by reference. The size of each such imaginary
surface is based on the categorization of this runway as a precision instrument runway. The slope and
dimensions of the imaginary surfaces, applied to each end of a runway, are determined by the most
precise approach existing or planned for the runway end. The surfaces are hereby established and
defined as follows.
1. Horizontal surface. A horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the
perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs with a radius of 10,000 ft from the
center of each end of the primary surface of each end of the runway, including any
planned extensions, and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs.
2. Conical surface. A surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the
horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
3. Primary surface. A surface longitudinally centered on a runway. The primary surface
extends 200 feet beyond each end of the runway. The elevation of any point on the
primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway
centerline. The width of the primary surface is 1,000 feet as required for precision
runway landings
4. Approach surface. A surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and
extending outward and upward from each end of the primary surface.
i. The inner edge of the approach surface is the same width as the primary
surface and it expands uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet as provided for
precision instrument runways.
ii. The approach surface extends for a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet at a
slope of 50 to 1 with an additional 40,000 feet at a slope of 40:1.
5. Transitional surface. These surfaces extend outward and upward at right angles to the
runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of 7 to 1 from the sides
of the primary surface and from the sides of the approach surfaces. Transitional surfaces
for those portions of the precision approach surface which project through and beyond
the limits of the conical surface extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally
from the edge of the approach surface and at right angles to the runway centerline.
2
C. Height limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure shall be erected,
altered or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow within the AZO district extending or
projecting into the lowest applicable imaginary surfaces defined herein.
D. Definitions
Approach Surface means the surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and
extending outward and upward from each end of the primary surface. The inner edge of the
approach surface is the same width as the primary surface and it expands uniformly to a width of
16,000 feet as provided for precision instrument runways. The approach surface extends from the
primary surface along the extended runway centerline for a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet at a
slope of 50 to 1 with an additional 40,000 feet at a slope of 40:1.
Horizontal surface means a horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation of 771
mean sea level, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs with a radius of 10,000 ft
from the center of each end of the primary surface of each end of the runway, including any planned
extensions, and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs.
Instrument land system (ILS) means a radio navigation system which provides aircraft with horizontal and
vertical guidance prior to and during landing, and at certain fixed points, indicates the distance to the
reference point of landing.
Precision instrument runway means a runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing
an Instrument Landing System (ILS), or a Precision Approach Radar (PAR). It also means a runway
for which a precision approach system is planned and is so indicated by an FAA approved airport
layout plan; a military service approved military airport layout plan; any other FAA planning
document, or military service military airport planning document.
Primary surface means a surface longitudinally centered on a runway. The primary surface extends 200
feet beyond each end of the runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same
as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. The width of the primary surface is
1,000 feet as required for precision runway landings.
Transitional surface means the surfaces extend outward and upward at right angles to the runway
centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of 7 to 1 from the sides of the primary
surface and from the sides of the approach surfaces. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the
precision approach surface which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface
extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at
right angles to the runway centerline.

result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velociti.es;
(2) require that uses vulnerable to t1oods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage
at the time of initial constrnction;
(3) control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, w·hich are involved
in the accommodation of-floodwaters;
( 4) control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and
(5) prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may
increase flood hazards to other lands.
