PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1962 Code, as supplemented through January 1, 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1962 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Jay Rubin, City Attorney, and Ms. Evelyn B. Renfro, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 1-8. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by City personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the Commission. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive parts of permanent and general ordinances passed by the Commission during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency, or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter", "this article", "this division", etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections or the alphabetical arrangement of new chapters inserted into the Code; but, in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-9. - Altering Code. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the City to be misrepresented thereby; provided, that supplementation of this Code by authorized persons shall be permitted. 
Sec. 1-10. - General penalty; continuing violations. 
(a)  Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the City an act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever in such Code or ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, and no specific penalty is provided therefor, the maximum penalty for violation of any municipal ordinance shall be as follows: 
(1)  Except for those violations of ordinances described in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this section, a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court;

(3)  For violations of an industrial user wastewater pretreatment ordinance as required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, a fine of not more than nine hundred ninety-nine dollars ($999.00) a day for each violation. 
(b)  Each day any such violation or failure to perform such act shall continue shall constitute a separate offense, unless otherwise specifically provided. 
(c)  The imposition of a penalty under the provisions of this Code shall not prevent the revocation or suspension of any license, franchise or permit issued or granted under the provisions of this Code. 
(d)  If any violation of this Code is designated as a nuisance under the provisions of this Code, such nuisance may be summarily abated by the City in addition to the imposition of a fine or imprisonment.

Sec. 1-11. - Severability of parts of Code. 
    The sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared invalid, unenforceable or unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, unenforceability or unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code. 
Sec. 1-12. - Effect of repeals. 
    The repeal of an ordinance or any portion thereof shall not revive any ordinance in force before or at the time the ordinance repealed took effect.

Sec. 1-13. - Certain ordinances not affected by Code. 
(a)  Nothing in this Code or the ordinance adopting this Code shall affect any ordinance:

ARTICLE III. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 4-166. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
    The legislature of the State of New Mexico has in NMSA 1978, § 3-18-7, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Commission of the City of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, does ordain as follows: 
(1)  Findings of fact. 
a.  The flood hazard areas of Truth or Consequences are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
b.  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(2)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
a.  Protect human life and health; 
b.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
c.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
d.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
e.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
f.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
g.  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(3)  Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods: 
a.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
b.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
c.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
d.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; 
e.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Code 1962, § 4-9-1) 
Sec. 4-167. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community 's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or, in the case of a building in zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, D, elevated building also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls, with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30, VE, or V, elevated building also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of elevated building, even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls, if the breakaway walls meet the standards of section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. Existing construction may also be referred to as existing structures. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff surface waters from any source. 
    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These specialized flood-modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Highest adjacent use means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(a)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(b)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(c)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
(d)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either; 
(1)  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or; 
(2)  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including the basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, useable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is (i) built on a single chassis; (ii) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (iii) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (iv) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Start of construction, for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions or (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

Sec. 4-168. - General provisions. 
(a)  Lands to which this article applies. This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City. 
(b)  Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study for the City of Truth or Consequences," dated July 16, 1996 with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Boundary-Floodway Maps (FIRM and FBFM) and any revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. 
(c)  Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this article. 
(d)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. 
(e)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(f)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur, and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

h.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
i.  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
j.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area. 
(d)  Variance procedures. 
(1)  The Appeal Board, as established by the community, shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this article. 
(2)  The Appeal Board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board may appeal such decision to the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(4)  The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this article. 
(6)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection (c)(2) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variances increases.

(8)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(9)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(10)  Prerequisites for granting variances. 
a.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
b.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
c.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(11)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
a.  The criteria outlined in subsection (d)(1) to (d)(9) of this section are met; and 
b.  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

DIVISION 3. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 4-206. - Standards. 
(a)  General standards. In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. 
(4)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and 
(7)  Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(b)  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data have been provided as set forth in section 4-168(b), section 4-186(b)(8) or subsection (c)(3) of this section, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor including the basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in section 4-186(c)(1)a. is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and he shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this section be elevated so that either; 
(i)  the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or 
(ii)  the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of Article 4, Section C(1), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in paragraph (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(c)  Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall be consistent with the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall meet the development permit requirements of sections 4-168(c), 4-186(c) and the provisions of this section. 
(3)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which are greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 4-168(b) or section 4-186(b). 
(4)  All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(5)  All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(d)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Article 3, Section B, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures: 
(i)  have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(ii)  together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this Section, as proposed in Article 4, Section C(1)a., are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Code 1962, § 4-9-5; Ord. No. 435, § 6, 4-23-96) 
Sec. 4-207. - Flood hazard areas. 
(a)  A building permit from the City must be obtained from the City Building Inspector after he determines that a proposed building site is reasonably safe from flooding.

1.  Over-the-top ties are required at each of the four corners of mobile homes with two additional ties to a side at intermediate locations; and mobile homes of less than 50 feet long require one additional tie to a side; 
2.  Frame ties at each corner of the mobile home are required with five additional ties to a side at intermediate points; and, on mobile homes of less than 50 feet in length, an additional four ties to a side are required; 
3.  All components of the anchoring system must be capable of carrying a force of 4,800 pounds; and 
4.  Any additions to a mobile home must be similarly anchored. 
b.  Where the mobile home housing unit manufacturer has issued specific instructions for footing and piers, those instructions should be followed except that the footing and pier specifications as prescribed by the New Mexico Mobile Home Commission are the minimum permitted. 
c.  An evacuation plan indicating all alternate vehicular access and escape routes shall be filed with the appropriate disaster preparedness authorities for mobile home parks and mobile home subdivisions located within zone A as shown on the flood hazard boundary map for the City. 
(b)  No person shall construct or cause to be constructed any structure or improvement, addition to any structure, residential, industrial, commercial, or otherwise, without first obtaining a building permit from the Building Inspector of the City. 
(c)  Proposed subdivisions and land use areas shall be reviewed by the City Building Inspector to assure, among other things, the following: 
(1)  That all proposals for construction provide for methods to minimize flood damage; 
(2)  That all public utilities and facilities such as sewage, gas, electrical service, and water systems are located and constructed so as to minimize the possibility of flood damage; 
(3)  That adequate drainage is provided for so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards; 
(4)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which are greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres. 
(d)  All new and replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewerage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharges from the system into the floodwaters. All onsite waste disposal systems shall be located so as to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(e)  Upon completion of any work or of the construction of any building under a building permit granted as aforesaid, the owner of such building permit shall report such completion to the Building Inspector. The Building Inspector shall, after completion, or at any time during the course of the work for which the building permit shall have been granted, cause an inspection of such building to be made. If there is evidence that any requirement of the law or of any applicable ordinance has not been complied with, the City shall commence prosecution under such law or ordinance to take the necessary steps to secure compliance. The completion of such work shall be noted on the original building permit. The Building Inspector shall indicate on the building permit the height and the mandatory floodproofing, and all clearances from ground levels of the first floor. The completed building permit shall be kept on file by the City Clerk. 
(f)  The City Manager shall review proposed developments with the City to assure that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments 1972, 33 USC 1334. 
(1)  He shall assure that the alteration of any watercourse shall not diminish the floodwater carrying capacity of the watercourse; 
(2)  He shall assure that any manmade changes in the landscape shall not adversely affect or increase flooding in Truth or Consequences; 
(3)  He shall request of the Village of Williamsburg and of the Sierra County Commission to advise and consult with the City before permitting the alteration of any watercourse, construction of any building or structure, or change in the landscapes that will adversely affect the City of Truth or Consequences flood hazard. 
(4)  The Governing Body of the City shall: 
a.  Restrict or prohibit the uses that are dangerous to the health, safety, or property of the citizens of the City or of the City in times of flood, or which might cause excessive increases in flood height or velocity; 
b.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, their protective barriers, and stream channels; 
c.  Prevent the construction of barriers which would divert floodwaters and subject the City to greater flood hazards. 
(g)  The decree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based upon the minimum requirements established by the Federal Insurance Administration of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the New Mexico State Engineer, the New Mexico Construction Industries Commission, the General Construction Board, the Mobile Home Housing Commission, and the ordinances of the City.

(g)  Geothermal waters. For purposes of this section, "geothermal waters" shall mean waters which in their natural state have both a temperature greater than 90 degrees Fahrenheit and a concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS) greater than 1,200 parts per million. The following conditions and limitations shall apply to new domestic water wells that are intended or reasonably expected to divert geothermal waters, or that upon completion are found actually to produce geothermal waters. 
(1)  There shall be no more than one domestic water well producing geothermal waters on any lot or parcel of land one acre in area or smaller. For purposes of this section 14-116, two or more adjacent lots or parcels of land in common ownership shall be considered a single lot or parcel. If an applicant seeks to drill or dig a new domestic water well to produce geothermal waters on a lot or parcel of land one acre in area or smaller where there is a pre-existing well producing geothermal waters, the City will require as a condition of approval that the pre- existing well shall be properly plugged and abandoned by a well driller licensed by the State of New Mexico within 60 days after the new well is completed. The City may, in its discretion, permit more than one domestic water well producing geothermal waters on a lot or parcel of land larger than one acre in area, provided that all wells on the property have been permitted by the New Mexico State Engineer. 
(2)  No new domestic water well producing geothermal waters shall be approved unless adequate provision has been made for the discharge of the geothermal waters after use. 
(3)  There shall be no cross-connection that could permit mingling of geothermal waters with any supply of drinking water, whether or not such drinking water supply is derived from the City water utility. 
(4)  A new domestic well producing geothermal waters shall be equipped with a totalizing meter of a design satisfactory to the City. The totalizing meter shall be properly calibrated and shall be capable of continuous, reliable operation in measuring the flow of warm waters with a high total dissolved solids content. The well owner shall record meter readings at least monthly, and shall annually report all meter readings made during each calendar year to the City, no later than February 1 of the subsequent year. The well owner shall also furnish the City copies of any meter readings or other reports required by the New Mexico State Engineer. 
(h)  Other waters. The following conditions shall apply to new domestic water wells that are intended or reasonably expected to produce waters that are not geothermal waters. 
(1)  An application for a new domestic water well to produce waters other than geothermal waters may be denied if the applicant's property is within the municipal boundaries, the nearest property boundary is within 300 feet of a municipal water utility distribution line, and the City can provide water utility service to the applicant's property within 90 days from the date of the application, unless the applicant's property is zoned and used primarily for agricultural purposes. If the application is denied, the City shall provide water utility service to the applicant's property within 90 days from the date of denial, subject to the City's standard charges and rate schedules. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection 14-116(h)(1), an application for a new domestic water well to produce waters other than geothermal waters shall be approved if the applicant's total cost of connection to the municipal water utility system, including costs incurred by extending the service line, purchasing a meter (not to include utility expansion charges or similar charges) and physically connecting to a residence is greater than the cost of drilling a new domestic water well, regardless of the property's distance from the municipal water utility distribution line. The applicant is responsible for demonstrating the cost of drilling a domestic water well on the property and shall present to the City a written quote by a well driller licensed by the State of New Mexico. The City shall determine whether the written quote is reasonable. Upon completion of any well drilled under this exemption, the applicant shall not use any water from the well before a sworn affidavit by the well driller showing the actual cost of drilling the well is submitted to, and accepted by, the City. If the actual cost of drilling the well exceeds the total cost of connection to the City water system, the well shall be plugged and abandoned and the City shall provide water service to the property. All applicable fees and costs of connection shall be paid by the applicant. 
(3)  The owner of a municipally permitted well producing non-geothermal waters shall furnish the City copies of any meter readings or other reports required for that well by the New Mexico State Engineer. 
(i)  Filing of well record. Upon completion of any domestic well approved by the City, the applicant or well driller shall file with the City's water/wastewater utility director a copy of the well record that is required to be filed with the Office of the State Engineer. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that the well record is properly filed. If the well record has not been filed within one year after City approval for a domestic well, such approval shall be considered void unless the applicant provides evidence satisfactory to the City that an extension of time has been granted for completion of the domestic well by the Office of the State Engineer, in which case the City will grant an extension of time commensurate with that granted by the Office of the State Engineer. 
(j)  Protection from organic chemical contamination. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the City may deny an application for a domestic water well under either of the following conditions: 
(1)  An application may be denied if it is determined by the City that the proposed well will be located within an area of existing ground water contamination, or in such close proximity to an area of existing ground water contamination, that it is reasonably expected to produce water containing any organic chemical contaminant in a concentration greater than the maximum contaminant level for that contaminant permitted under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, as amended, and regulations promulgated thereunder, or greater than the allowable concentration for any organic chemical contaminant listed in Subpart A of Section 20.6.2.3103 of the New Mexico Administrative Code. This subsection shall not be deemed to prohibit or limit the production and use of water containing inorganic chemical constituents in excess of drinking water standards, whether Federal or State, provided that such water is not contaminated by the presence of organic chemical constituents in excess of the concentrations stated in this subsection. 
(2)  An application may be denied if it appears, based on information available to the City, that production of water from the well is likely to cause the migration or spread of contaminated water from an area of existing ground water contamination, even if the water actually produced by the proposed well does not exceed the organic contaminant levels described in the preceding subsection. Where the possibility of such migration or spread of contaminated water appears to exist, the City as a condition of permit approval may require that the applicant provide ground water flow modeling or other evidence and documentation by a qualified engineer or hydrogeologist, satisfactory to the City, demonstrating that the production of water from the proposed well will not cause the migration or spread of contaminated water to the detriment of other well users and property owners. The City may limit production of water from a well to an amount less than that approved by the New Mexico State Engineer, if it appears that such limitation is necessary to protect ground water quality. 
(Ord. No. 651, §§ 1, 2, 2-11-14) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 651, §§ 1, 2, adopted Feb. 11, 2014, repealed the former § 14-116, and enacted a new § 14-116 as set out herein. The former § 14-116 pertained to moratorium for the drilling of new domestic wells, and derived from Ord. No. 628, § 1, adopted Aug. 14, 2012; Ord. No. 638, § 1, adopted Aug. 13, 2013; and Ord. No. 650, § 1, adopted Nov. 21, 2013. 
Sec. 14-117. - Management of geothermal waters after use. 
(a)  Authority and purpose. This section is enacted pursuant to the authority of NMSA 1978, § 3-23-1 (1965 and as subsequently amended) and NMSA 1978, §§ 3-26-1 through 3-26-3 (1965 and as subsequently amended), the Federal Clean Water Act, and the New Mexico Water Quality Act (NMSA 1978, §§ 74-6-1 through 74-6-17 (1967, and as subsequently amended)). The purpose of this section is to provide for the safe and appropriate disposal of geothermal waters produced from wells permitted by the Office of the State Engineer under NMSA 1978, § 72-12-1 ("domestic water wells") to ensure protection of the resource, to ensure compliance with environmental regulations, and to provide for the health, safety and general welfare of City residents and visitors. 
(b)  Geothermal waters; definition and scope. This section applies to the discharge or disposal of geothermal waters produced from domestic water wells within the City after the application of the waters to beneficial use. For purposes of this section, "geothermal waters" shall mean waters which in their natural state have both a temperature greater than 90 degrees Fahrenheit and a concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS) greater than 1,200 parts per million (ppm). Due to possible residual heat and to the elevated concentration of TDS, geothermal waters require appropriate disposal and may require additional treatment before disposal in order to ensure that there is no degradation of quality in the watercourse or subsurface reservoir to which the geothermal waters are disposed. 
(c)  Discharge or disposal of geothermal waters. Each applicant seeking a City permit for a domestic water well that is expected or intended to produce geothermal waters shall describe the proposed method for discharge or disposal of such waters following their use. Discharge or disposal by the method proposed and approved shall be a condition of the permit, and any person seeking to alter the actual method of discharge or disposal shall apply to the City for approval of the altered method for discharge or disposal of the geothermal waters before making the change. Subject to the regulations and limitations of this section, a user of geothermal waters from domestic water wells within the City may discharge or dispose of such waters by one of three methods: (i) disposal to a French drain or land surface application if permitted by the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) under applicable regulations; (ii) disposal to the City's hot water drain (the "hot ditch"); or (iii) disposal to the municipal wastewater utility system. An applicant may propose an alternative method of discharge or disposal which the City may approve if the applicant demonstrates to the City's satisfaction that the alternative method is at least as protective of water quality and the health, safety and general welfare as the specific methods enumerated in this subsection and is not contrary to any applicable regulation of the United States or the state of New Mexico. 
(d)  Discharge or disposal by infiltration. An applicant seeking to discharge or dispose of geothermal waters produced from a domestic water well into the subsurface shall provide documentation showing that the discharge or proposed discharge has been permitted by NMED in accordance with Section 20.6.2.3104 of the New Mexico Administrative Code (NMAC) or other applicable regulation, or else that no NMED permit is required because the discharge or proposed discharge is exempted from the permit requirement pursuant to Section 20.6.2.3105 NMAC or other applicable regulation. If the applicant is required to provide reports or other documentation to NMED, then copies of such reports or other documentation shall be supplied to the City at the same time they are submitted to NMED. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the City may deny an application for a domestic water well permit seeking to discharge or dispose of geothermal waters into the subsurface if the disposal location is within 1,000 feet laterally of a municipal water supply well or other well that is a source of public drinking water supply. 
(e)  Discharge to the hot ditch. Discharge of geothermal waters from a domestic water well to the hot ditch shall require a permit from the City. An application for permit to discharge to the hot ditch shall describe the location of the discharge, the volume of water to be discharged on a monthly or annual basis, the anticipated temperature and TDS concentration of the discharge, and any other pertinent information requested by the City. The application shall be accompanied by an application fee of $100.00. 
(1)  A permit to discharge to the hot ditch will be valid for a period of five years and will be renewable upon application to the City within three months prior to the expiration date. Persons discharging geothermal waters from a domestic water well to the hot ditch and intending to continue such discharge shall apply for a permit within one year after enactment of this section. Application for a permit to allow a new discharge to the hot ditch may be made at any time. 
(2)  To defray City costs for maintenance and operation of the hot ditch, there shall be a monthly fee imposed for each point of discharge to the hot ditch from a domestic water well. The fee shall be in the same amount as the fee for discharge of geothermal waters to the wastewater utility system as provided in section 14-79, service charges. 
(3)  The volume of geothermal waters produced from a domestic water well and discharged to the hot ditch by each permittee shall be determined by either (i) accurate, continuous measurement of the discharge by a method satisfactory to the City, or (ii) measurement of the volume of geothermal waters produced by the well or wells serving the premises, which volume shall be deemed to be the volume of the discharge from the premises except for any adjustments that may be mutually agreed between the City and the permittee, for good cause shown. Water diversion (meter) reports required by and provided to the office of the New Mexico State Engineer shall constitute compliance with the requirement for measurement of the volume of geothermal waters produced. 
(4)  Permits for discharge of waters produced from domestic water wells to the hot ditch shall run with the well or wells producing the geothermal water to be discharged. If any domestic water well is sold or otherwise transferred to a different owner or owners, any permit issued to the former owners shall remain in good standing so long as the new owners file with the City a notice of change of ownership, along with a filing fee of $25.00, within a reasonable time following the change of ownership. If the new owners fail to file a notice of change of ownership, after notification by the City that the notice is required, the City may require that the discharge of waters to the hot ditch be discontinued. 
(5)  Duly authorized officers, employees or agents of the City shall have the right to enter upon any premises at reasonable times to inspect, sample, and determine the flow rate of each discharge into the hot ditch, and to ensure the adequate maintenance and proper operation of the discharge facility. 
(f)  Discharge to the municipal wastewater utility system. Discharge of geothermal waters from a domestic water well to the municipal wastewater (sewer) system for treatment and disposal shall be only in accordance with applicable sections of the Municipal Code, including but not necessarily limited to sections 14-66 through 14-115 and this section 14-117. 
(1)  The monthly fee for discharge of geothermal waters to the wastewater utility system shall be as provided in section 14-79, service charges. 
(2)  The volume of geothermal waters from domestic water wells discharged to the wastewater utility system from each connection shall be determined by either (i) accurate, continuous measurement of the discharge by a method satisfactory to the City, or (ii) measurement of the volume of geothermal waters produced by the well or wells serving the premises, which volume shall be deemed to be the volume of the discharge from the premises except for any adjustments that may be mutually agreed between the City and the permittee, for good cause shown. Water diversion (meter) reports required by and provided to the office of the New Mexico State Engineer shall constitute compliance with the requirement for measurement of the volume of geothermal waters produced. 
(3)  Duly authorized officers, employees or agents of the City shall have the right to enter upon any premises at reasonable times to inspect, sample, and determine the flow rate of geothermal water discharges to the wastewater utility system, and to ensure the adequate maintenance and proper operation of the facilities and equipment required for such discharge.

Sec. 15-8. - Variances. 
A.  Cause: Where, in the case of a particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown that strict compliance with the requirements of this Code would result in a substantial or unreasonable hardship to the subdivider because of exceptional topographic, soil or other surface or subsurface conditions, or that strict compliance with this Code would result in inhibiting the achievement of the objectives of this Code, the Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the City Commission may approve variances, modification or waivers of this Code's requirements. No variance shall be granted simply because the subdivider disagrees with or does not wish to meet the goals, objectives or standards of this Code. 
B.  Required findings: Before recommending approval of a variance to the Planning and Zoning Commission, the City's Zoning Administrator shall make the following findings of fact. These same findings must be made by the Planning and Zoning Commission before it may recommend approval to the City Commission. The same findings must be made by the City Commission before it may approve a subdivision with variances and must form the basis of its decision when acting on an appeal regarding a variance. Granting a variance: 
1.  Shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the area of notice; 
2.  Shall not result in detriment to the public health, safety, or welfare, or be materially injurious to properties or improvements in the area of notice;

Is justified because a physical hardship to the applicant is caused by existing size or shape of the lot, by existing structures, topographic or physical conditions on the site or in the area of notice, or if a physical hardship to the applicant would result from strict compliance with this Code; 
4.  Upholds the spirit and intent of this Code, public safety and welfare will be secured, and substantial justice done; 
5.  Will not result in the City being caused to absorb costs over and above those typically associated with subdivision approval; 
6.  Is not contrary to the requirements of state law; 
7.  Will not cause negative impacts on adjoining properties, properties in the area of notice, or to the public well being. 
C.  Procedures and requirements: The following procedures and requirements shall apply to all requests for variances under this Code. 
1.  Requests for variances and the review fee shall be submitted in writing prior to or at the time of request for preliminary plat approval. 
2.  Variances will be reviewed and acted on as separate agenda items from the subdivision as a whole, however, approval or denial of a subdivision by the City may be determined by the results of a vote on a variance. 
3.  The request shall describe in detail the specific sections of this Code from which a variance is being requested, and shall describe in detail the specific reasons that justify a variance. It is the subdivider's responsibility to address and prove each and every finding of fact. 
4.  Variance requests shall be reviewed by the City Planning and Zoning Commission in public hearings prior to or concurrent with public meetings that are held for recommendations for approval or denial of the subdivision. 
5.  Notice of the request for variance shall be given to all owners of record of property within 300 feet of the area proposed for subdivision, excluding streets, alleys, channels and other rights-of-way, and shall be published in the same manner as notice is provided for any public hearing required in this Code, and shall comply with the Open Meetings Act of the State of New Mexico 
6.  Variance requests shall be submitted to any reviewing agencies having expertise with respect to the subject matter for which the variance is sought. Comments on variances by such agencies shall be received by the City before the City acts on the subdivision requiring the review. In cases where a variance to the standards of any other entity is requested as part of a subdivision application, the City shall not approve the subdivision until it has received certification from that entity, in writing, that the entity has approved the variance request. 
D.  Conditions on variances: In granting variances, the City may impose conditions regarding further expansions, maximum height limits, time limits, types of construction, and other standards that will ensure that approval of the variance results in substantial conformity with the intent of this Code. 
E.  Notification of action: The City's Zoning Administrator shall notify the subdivider in writing within five working days following consideration of a variance by the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or the City Commission. Said letter shall state the nature and conditions of approval of variances, or alternately, shall state the reasons for denial of a variance.

n.  Clean-out boxes or inlets shall be used at all changes of alignment in drains. 
o.  Whenever a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage way, channel or stream, the subdivider may at his own expense, make adequate provision for straightening or widening the channel so that it will properly carry the surface water, and shall also provide and dedicate to the City an easement containing and along each side of the channel or drainage way. The width of such easement shall not be less than 20 feet and shall be computed from the outside center of the channel or drainage way. Further, the total width of the easement shall be adequate to provide for any necessary channel relocations and straightening. This easement must be in addition to the required yard setback requirements of each respective Zoning District. 
6.  Control of dust during construction: Adequate provisions shall be made for the prevention of nuisances, including watering, to control blowing dust any time the natural ground surface is disturbed and further to control the erosion, drainage, siltation or any other factors which might adversely affect other persons or adjoining property owners. 
I.  Underground utilities: 
1.  All utility lines for telephone, electric services, cable television or the like shall be placed underground within easements or dedicated public ways in a manner which will not conflict with other underground services. Further, all transformer boxes shall be located so as not to be unsightly or hazardous to the public.

J.  Private facilities: Where the subdivision is to contain sewage facilities, water supply systems, park areas or other physical facilities which will not be maintained by existing public agencies, provision shall be made by trust agreement for the continuous maintenance, supervision, operation and reconstruction of such facilities by the lot owners in the subdivision. This agreement shall be a part of the deed restrictions and shall be in a form acceptable to the public agencies having jurisdiction over the respective facilities. 
K.  Existing non-conforming plats: Plats that were in existence prior to the original date of this chapter (11/12/02) shall not be required to conform to the provisions of this Code. Specifically, those provisions that require the construction of streets and utilities prior to recordation of the subdivision. These prior plats shall be known as "legal-non-conforming plats". Said non-conforming status shall protect these plats for a period not to exceed five years from the original date of this chapter. The legal-non-conforming status of all subdivisions that have not had residences, businesses or industrial building constructed upon them, or had any lots sold shall expire on 11/12/07. From that date forward, any person wishing to receive a building permit for a structure authorized by the Zoning Code on land that was platted prior to the requirements of this chapter and that has not conformed to the requirements of this chapter, will not be issued a building permit until such time as said property comes into compliance with the requirements of this chapter specifically related to the provision of utilities and street improvements.

6.  Movement: Signs that simulate movement by use of lighting may be allowed at the discretion of the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Commission must make a finding that stipulates that said movement will not cause an undue distraction to motorists and thereby be classified as a traffic hazard.

ARTICLE XVI. - INDUSTRIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (IPUD) 

Sec. 11-16-1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this district is to provide for industrial uses in a planned development. Commercial uses are limited in size and in scope to those uses that serve the industrial businesses, their employees and visitors. Residential uses are not allowed under this designation, except to allow for caretaker living quarters for an on-site custodian or watchperson. The ideal development under this IPUD will be friendly to the environment by use of modern planning, architectural and engineering techniques meant to reduce air, water, ground and scenic contamination. The use of pedestrian friendly development is also encouraged and will be a standard used by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Commission in reviewing proposed projects. It is also the intent and purpose of this designation that through the use of a special use permit all adjacent property owners and citizens will participate in the planning process through public meetings. Further it is the expressed intent that development takes place in an orderly manner that includes the existing or potential uses of surrounding properties and all property under the proponent's control. In order to provide maximum flexibility in design and quality of development the City Commission may agree to proposed modifications in the requirements of the City's Zoning and Subdivision Regulations.

c.  HORIZONTAL SURFACE. A horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation. 
d.  INNER END and OUTER END. The inner end of a surface is the end closest to the runway, the outer end of a surface is the end furthest from the runway. 
e.  PRIMARY SURFACE. A surface longitudinally centered on a runway. When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary surface extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway; when the runway has no specially prepared hard surface, or planned hard surface, the primary surface ends at each end of that runway. The width of the primary surface is set forth in Table 2 of this ordinance. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. 
f.  TRANSITIONAL SURFACES. These surfaces extend outward at 90 degree angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven (7) feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the precision approach surfaces, which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at 90 degree angles to the extended runway centerline. 
C.  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS. The Airport Impact Overlay District is divided into six (6) Airport Overlay Impact Sub-Districts (Sub-Districts) as shown in Table 1. The Sub-Districts are based on areas described in FAR Part 77 and FAA Advisory Circulars (AC). Tables 2 and 3 provide dimensional standards for the Sub-Districts. The Sub-Districts are specific to the Airport and are based on the runway configurations as shown on the FAA approved ALP. In addition to development standards for each of the six Sub-Districts, development must also comply with the requirements applicable to the entire overlay, as described below and to the underlying zoning. 
    Differing development criteria are applied to each Sub-District. Prior to proposed development and/or to the issuance of a building permit, the project shall be reviewed according to the development standards identified in Table 4 and this section, to ensure compatibility with airport operations and to protect the health and safety of people and property on the ground. As Sub-Districts may overlap, the more restrictive Sub-Districts govern. 
    Table 5 provides the FAR Part 77 Classification and RPZ number for the runways at the Truth or Consequences Municipal Airport.

G.  NON-CONFORMING USES. Legal uses that existed as of the date of adoption of this ordinance but do not meet the requirements of this Overlay District will be grandfathered in as non-conforming uses. 
    The owner of any legal non-conforming structure or natural growth is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the City to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the City of Truth or Consequences. 
H.  COMPLIANCE WITH FAR PART 77. FAR, Part 77, Section 77.9 states that any person/organization who intends to sponsor any of the following construction or alterations must notify the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA): 
  Any construction or alteration exceeding 200 feet above ground level. 
  Any construction or alteration: 
  Within 20,000 feet of a public use airport which exceeds one hundred (100) feet outward for each one (1) foot upward surface from any point on the runway of each airport; 
  Any highway, railroad or other traverse way whose prescribed adjusted height would exceed the FAR adjusted heights; 
  When requested by the FAA; or 
  Any construction or alteration located on a public use airport or heliport regardless of height or location. 
Notification is accomplished through the process prescribed by the FAA. 
1.  When notice is required under the FAR Part 77, the project sponsor shall provide a copy of the FAA issued Airspace Number to the City Airport Manager at the time of submission to FAA. A copy of the FAA airspace determination for each notice to FAA shall be provided to the City Airport Manager upon receipt from the FAA and shall be included in any permit or variance request. The Building Inspector will assist project sponsors in determining if notice is required. 
2.  When notice is not required under the FAR Part 77, the project sponsor shall include the calculations or information from the FAA supporting this decision to the City Airport Manager and Building Inspector for verification. 
3.  The City Airport Manager will evaluate all FAA airspace determinations received from the project sponsor and shall inform the project sponsor and the Building Inspector within 15 working days of receipt, if the FAA airspace determination contains any adverse impact to the airport or airspace. 
4.  A FAA airspace determination that has an adverse impact will not be issued a permit. Examples of an adverse impact are any condition that changes the airspace, instrument approach procedures, limits airport development, or similar. A variance may be considered after consultation with the FAA on mitigation measures and the project sponsor agreement to the mitigation measures. 
I.  APPEALS. The process contained in the Comprehensive Planning and Zoning Code will be used for any appeals or variances requested under this ordinance.
